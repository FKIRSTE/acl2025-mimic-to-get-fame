Food Security,"

Food security is the state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. The availability of food for people of any class and state, gender or religion is another element of food security. Similarly, household food security is considered to exist when all the members of a family, at all times, have access to enough food for an active, healthy life.[1] Individuals who are food-secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation.[2] Food security includes resilience to future disruptions of food supply. Such a disruption could occur due to various risk factors such as droughts and floods, shipping disruptions, fuel shortages, economic instability, and wars.[3] Food insecurity is the opposite of food security: a state where there is only limited or uncertain availability of suitable food.

The concept of food security has evolved over time. The four pillars of food security include availability, access, utilization, and stability.[4] In addition, there are two more dimensions that are important: agency and sustainability. These six dimensions of food security are reinforced in conceptual and legal understandings of the right to food.[5][6] The World Food Summit in 1996 declared that ""food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure.""[7][8]

There are many causes of food insecurity. The most important ones are high food prices and disruptions in global food supplies for example due to war. There is also climate change, water scarcity, land degradation, agricultural diseases, pandemics and disease outbreaks that can all lead to food insecurity.

The effects of food insecurity can include hunger and even famines. Chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to hunger and famine.[9] Chronic hunger and malnutrition in childhood can lead to stunted growth of children.[10] Once stunting has occurred, improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage. Severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development.[11]

Food security, as defined by the World Food Summit in 1996, is ""when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to ""sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life"".[12][13]

Food insecurity, on the other hand, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a situation of ""limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.""[14]

At the 1974 World Food Conference, the term food security was defined with an emphasis on supply; it was defined as the ""availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset the fluctuations in production and prices.""[15] Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The first World Food Summit, held in 1996, stated that food security ""exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.""[16][7]

Chronic (or permanent) food insecurity is defined as the long-term, persistent lack of adequate food.[17] In this case, households are constantly at risk of being unable to acquire food to meet the needs of all members. Chronic and transitory food insecurity are linked since the reoccurrence of transitory food security can make households more vulnerable to chronic food insecurity.[18]

As of 2015[update], the concept of food security has mostly focused on food calories rather than the quality and nutrition of food. The concept of nutrition security or nutritional security evolved as a broader concept. In 1995, it was defined as ""adequate nutritional status in terms of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals for all household members at all times.""[19]: 16 
It is also related to the concepts of nutrition education and nutritional deficiency.[20]

Food security can be measured by the number of calories to digest per person per day, available on a household budget.[21][22] In general, the objective of food security indicators and measurements is to capture some or all of the main components of food security in terms of food availability, accessibility, and utilization/adequacy. While availability (production and supply) and utilization/adequacy (nutritional status/ anthropometric measurement) are easier to estimate and therefore more popular, accessibility (the ability to acquire a sufficient quantity and quality of food) remains largely elusive.[23] The factors influencing household food accessibility are often context-specific.[24]

FAO has developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) as a universally applicable experience-based food security measurement scale derived from the scale used in the United States. Thanks to the establishment of a global reference scale and the procedure needed to calibrate measures obtained in different countries, it is possible to use the FIES to produce cross-country comparable estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity in the population.[25] Since 2015, the FIES has been adopted as the basis to compile one of the indicators included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring framework.[26]

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) collaborate every year to produce The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, or SOFI report (known as The State of Food Insecurity in the World until 2015).

The SOFI report measures chronic hunger (or undernourishment) using two main indicators, the Number of undernourished (NoU) and the Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU). Beginning in the early 2010s, FAO incorporated more complex metrics into its calculations, including estimates of food losses in retail distribution for each country and the volatility in agri-food systems. Since 2014, it has also reported the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity based on the FIES.[27]

Several measurements have been developed to capture the access component of food security, with some notable examples developed by the USAID-funded Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) project.[24][28][29][30] These include:

Close to 12 percent of the global population was severely food insecure in 2020, representing 928 million people -148 million more than in 2019.[5] A variety of reasons lie behind the increase in hunger over the past few years. Slowdowns and downturns since the 2008–9 financial crisis have conspired to degrade social conditions, making undernourishment more prevalent. Structural imbalances and a lack of inclusive policies have combined with extreme weather events, altered environmental conditions, and the spread of pests and diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, triggering stubborn cycles of poverty and hunger. In 2019, the high cost of healthy diets together with persistently high levels of income inequality put healthy diets out of reach for around 3 billion people, especially the poor, in every region of the world.[5]

Inequality in the distributions of assets, resources and income, compounded by the absence or scarcity of welfare provisions in the poorest of countries, is further undermining access to food. Nearly a tenth of the world population still lives on US$1.90 or less a day, with sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia the regions most affected.[35]

High import and export dependence ratios are meanwhile making many countries more vulnerable to external shocks. In many low-income economies, debt has swollen to levels far exceeding GDP, eroding growth prospects.

Finally, there are increasing risks to institutional stability, persistent violence, and large-scale population relocation as a consequence of the conflicts. With the majority of them being hosted in developing nations, the number of displaced individuals between 2010 and 2018 increased by 70% between 2010 and 2018 to reach 70.8 million.[36]

Recent editions of the SOFI report (The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World) present evidence that the decades-long decline in hunger in the world, as measured by the number of undernourished (NoU), has ended. In the 2020 report, FAO used newly accessible data from China to revise the global NoU downwards to nearly 690 million, or 8.9 percent of the world population – but having recalculated the historic hunger series accordingly, it confirmed that the number of hungry people in the world, albeit lower than previously thought, had been slowly increasing since 2014. On broader measures, the SOFI report found that far more people suffered some form of food insecurity, with 3 billion or more unable to afford even the cheapest healthy diet.[37]  Nearly 2.37 billion people did not have access to adequate food in 2020 – an increase of 320 million people compared to 2019.[38][39]

FAO's 2021 edition of The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) further estimates that an additional 1 billion people (mostly in lower- and upper-middle-income countries) are at risk of not affording a healthy diet if a shock were to reduce their income by a third.[40]

The 2021 edition of the SOFI report estimated the hunger excess linked to the COVID-19 pandemic at 30 million people by the end of the decade[5] – FAO had earlier warned that even without the pandemic, the world was off track to achieve Zero Hunger or Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals – it further found that already in the first year of the pandemic, the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) had increased 1.5 percentage points, reaching a level of around 9.9 percent. This is the mid-point of an estimate of 720 to 811 million people facing hunger in 2020 – as many as 161 million more than in 2019.[38][39] The number had jumped by some 446 million in Africa, 57 million in Asia, and about 14 million in Latin America and the Caribbean.[5]

At the global level, the prevalence of food insecurity at a moderate or severe level, and severe level only, is higher among women than men, magnified in rural areas.[41]

In 2023, the Global Report on Food Crises revealed that acute hunger affected approximately 282 million people across 59 countries, an increase of 24 million from the previous year. This rise in food insecurity was primarily driven by conflicts, economic shocks, and extreme weather. Regions like the Gaza Strip and South Sudan were among the hardest hit, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions to address and mitigate global hunger effectively.[42]

Food insecurity in children can lead to developmental impairments and long term consequences such as weakened physical, intellectual and emotional development.[43]

By way of comparison, in one of the largest food producing countries in the world, the United States, approximately one out of six people are ""food insecure,"" including 17 million children, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2009.[44]  A 2012 study in the Journal of Applied Research on Children found that rates of food security varied significantly by race, class and education. In both kindergarten and third grade, 8% of the children were classified as food insecure, but only 5% of white children were food insecure, while 12% and 15% of black and Hispanic children were food insecure, respectively. In third grade, 13% of black and 11% of Hispanic children were food insecure compared to 5% of white children.[45][46]

Gender inequality both leads to and is a result of food insecurity. According to estimates, girls and women make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little progress has been made in ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.[47][48]

At the global level, the gender gap in the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity grew even larger in the year of COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 SOFI report finds that in 2019 an estimated 29.9 percent of women aged between 15 and 49 years around the world were affected by anemia.[5]

The gap in food insecurity between men and women widened from 1.7 percentage points in 2019 to 4.3 percentage points in 2021.[49]

Women play key roles in maintaining all four pillars of food security: as food producers and agricultural entrepreneurs; as decision-makers for the food and nutritional security of their households and communities and as ""managers"" of the stability of food supplies in times of economic hardship.[41]

The gender gap in accessing food increased from 2018 to 2019, particularly at moderate or severe levels.[41]

Famines have been frequent in world history. Some have killed millions and substantially diminished the population of a large area. The most common causes have been drought and war, but the greatest famines in history were caused by economic policy.[51] One economic policy example of famine was the Holodomor (Great Famine) induced by the Soviet Union's communist economic policy resulting in 7–10 million deaths.[52]

In the late 20th century the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen observed that ""there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem.""[53] While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger famine conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.  The 20th century has examples of governments, such as Collectivization in the Soviet Union or the Great Leap Forward in the People's Republic of China undermining the food security of their nations.  Mass starvation is frequently a weapon of war, as in the blockade of Germany in World War I[54] and World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic, and the blockade of Japan during World War I and World War II and in the Hunger Plan enacted by Nazi Germany.[55]

The WHO states that  three pillars that determine food security: food availability, food access, and food use and misuse.[56] The FAO added a fourth pillar: the stability of the first three dimensions of food security over time.[2] In 2009, the World Summit on Food Security stated that the ""four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization, and stability.""[4]
Two additional pillars of food security were recommended in 2020 by the High-Level Panel of Experts for the Committee on World Food Security: agency and sustainability.[6]

Food availability relates to the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange.[57] Food production is determined by a variety of factors including land ownership and use; soil management; crop selection, breeding, and management; livestock breeding and management; and harvesting.[18] Crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures.[57] The use of land, water, and energy to grow food often compete with other uses, which can affect food production.[58] Land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification, salinization or soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices.[58] Crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security. Nations do not have to have the natural resources required to produce crops to achieve food security, as seen in the examples of Japan[59][60] and Singapore.[61]

Because food consumers outnumber producers in every country,[61] food must be distributed to different regions or nations.
Food distribution involves the storage, processing, transport, packaging, and marketing of food.[18] Food-chain infrastructure and storage technologies on farms can also affect the amount of food wasted in the distribution process.[58] Poor transport infrastructure can increase the price of supplying water and fertilizer as well as the price of moving food to national and global markets.[58] Around the world, few individuals or households are continuously self-reliant on food. This creates the need for a bartering, exchange, or cash economy to acquire food.[57] The exchange of food requires efficient trading systems and market institutions, which can affect food security.[17] Per capita world food supplies are more than adequate to provide food security to all, and thus food accessibility is a greater barrier to achieving food security.[61]

Food access refers to the affordability and allocation of food, as well as the preferences of individuals and households.[57] The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that the causes of hunger and malnutrition are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food, usually due to poverty.[62] Poverty can limit access to food, and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes.[17] Access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at prevailing prices or has sufficient land and other resources to grow its food.[63] Households with enough resources can overcome unstable harvests and local food shortages and maintain their access to food.[61]

There are two distinct types of access to food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere.[18] Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on.[63] The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household's access to food.[18] However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services.[17] Demographics and education levels of members of the household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that is purchased.[63] A household's access to adequate nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake for all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household.[17] The USDA adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.[1]

The monetary value of global food exports multiplied by 4.4 in nominal terms between 2000 and 2021, from US$380 billion in 2000 to US$1.66 trillion in 2021.[64]

The next pillar of food security is food utilization, which refers to the metabolism of food by individuals.[61] Once the food is obtained by a household, a variety of factors affect the quantity and quality of food that reaches members of the household. To achieve food security, the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual.[17] Food safety affects food utilization,[57] and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of food in the community and household.[18]

Nutritional values[57] of the household determine food choice,[18] and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social well-being.[65] Access to healthcare is another determinant of food utilization since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized.[18] For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food utilization.[61] Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food utilization.[18][66] Education about nutrition and food preparation can affect food utilization and improve this pillar of food security.[61]

Food stability refers to the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic.[18] In transitory food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time.[17] At the food production level, natural disasters[17] and drought[18] result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food.[17] Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.[18]

Agency refers to the capacity of individuals or groups to make their own decisions about what foods they eat, what foods they produce, how that food is produced, processed, and distributed within food systems, and their ability to engage in processes that shape food system policies and governance.[6] This term shares similar values to those of another important concept, Food sovereignty.[67]

Sustainability refers to the long-term ability of food systems to provide food security and nutrition in a way that does not compromise the economic, social, and environmental bases that generate food security and nutrition for future generations.[6]

During 2022 and 2023 there were food crises in several regions as indicated by rising food prices. In 2022, the world experienced significant food price inflation along with major food shortages in several regions. Sub-Saharan Africa, Iran, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Iraq were most affected.[68][69][70] Prices of wheat, maize, oil seeds, bread, pasta, flour, cooking oil, sugar, egg, chickpea and meat increased.[71][72][73] 
Many factors have contributed to the ongoing world food crisis. These include supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021–2023 global energy crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and floods and heatwaves during 2021 (which destroyed key American and European crops).[74] Droughts were also a factor; in early 2022, some areas of Spain and Portugal lost 60–80% of their crops due to widespread drought.[75]

The World Food Programme has stated that pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic risk undermining the efforts of humanitarian and food security organizations to maintain food security.[80] The International Food Policy Research Institute expressed concerns that the increased connections between markets and the complexity of food and economic systems could cause disruptions to food systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically affecting the poor.[81]

The Ebola outbreak in 2014 led to increases in the prices of staple foods in West Africa.[82] Stringent lockdowns, travel restrictions, and disruptions to labor forces resulted in bottlenecks affecting the production and distribution of goods. Notably, the food supply chain experienced significant disruptions as the pandemic strained logistics, labor availability, and demand patterns. While progress in combating COVID-19 has provided some relief, the pandemic's lasting effects persist, including shifts in consumer behavior and the ongoing necessity for health and safety measures.[83]

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation.[85]

Natural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia, via the Haber process, for use in fertilizer production.[86][87] The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth — it has been estimated that almost half the people on Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.[88][89]

Diseases affecting livestock or crops can have devastating effects on food availability especially if there are no contingency plans in place.
For example, Ug99, a lineage of wheat stem rust, which can cause up to 100% crop losses, is present in wheat fields in several countries in Africa and the Middle East and is predicted to spread rapidly through these regions and possibly further afield, potentially causing a wheat production disaster that would affect food security worldwide.[90][91]

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global food supplies.[92] The conflict has severely impacted food supply chains with noteworthy effects on production, sourcing, manufacturing, processing, logistics, and significant shifts in demand among nations reliant on imports from Ukraine.[92] The European Union's imposition of sanctions on Russia has added complexity to trade relations.[83] In Asia and the Pacific, many of those regions' countries depend on the importation of basic food staples such as wheat and also fertilizer, with nearly 1.1 billion lacking a healthy diet caused by poverty and ever-increasing food prices.[93]

Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and a decline of agricultural yields.[94] Other causes of land degradation include for example deforestation, overgrazing, and over-exploitation of vegetation for use.[95] Approximately 40 percent of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[96]

While the Green Revolution was critical in supporting a larger population through the mid-1900s to now by increasing crop yields, it has also resulted in environmental degradation particularly through land use, soil degradation, and deforestation. Over-farming of agricultural land due to the Green Revolution has caused contamination and erosion of soil, and a reduction in biodiversity due to pesticide usage (as well as deforestation). Malnutrition rates and food insecurity could increase again as land and water resources are depleted.[97]

Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest number of water-stressed countries of any place on the globe, as of an estimated 800 million people who live in Africa, 300 million live in a water-stressed environment.[98] It is estimated that by 2030, 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be living in areas of high water stress, which will likely displace anywhere between 24 million and 700 million people as conditions become increasingly unlivable.[98] Because the majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and 80 to 90 percent of all families in rural Africa rely upon producing their food,[99] water scarcity translates to a loss of food security.[100]

The overexploitation of fish stocks can pose serious risks to food security. Risks can be posed both directly by overexploitation of food fish and indirectly through overexploitation of the fish that those food fish depend on for survival.[101] In 2022 the United Nations called attention ""considerably negative impact"" on food security of the fish oil and fishmeal industries in West Africa.[102]

Food waste may be diverted for alternative human consumption when economic variables allow for it. In the 2019 edition of the State of Food and Agriculture, FAO asserted that food loss and waste have potential effects on the four pillars of food security. However, the links between food loss and waste reduction and food security are complex, and positive outcomes are not always certain. Reaching acceptable levels of food security and nutrition inevitably implies certain levels of food loss and waste. Maintaining buffers to ensure food stability requires a certain amount of food to be lost or wasted. At the same time, ensuring food safety involves discarding unsafe food, which then is counted as lost or wasted, while higher-quality diets tend to include more highly perishable foods.[104]

How the impacts on the different dimensions of food security play out and affect the food security of different population groups depends on where in the food supply chain the reduction in losses or waste takes place as well as on where nutritionally vulnerable and food-insecure people are located geographically.[104]

In 2023, climate change significantly impacted food security, with extreme weather events being primary drivers in 18 countries, affecting over 77 million people. The year marked the hottest on record, leading to severe climatic disturbances such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes. These events disrupted agriculture, damaged crops, and decreased food availability, underlining the crucial need for urgent global action to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts to protect food sources.[105]

Climate change will affect agriculture and food production around the world. The reasons include the effects of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures and altered precipitation and transpiration regimes are also factors. Increased frequency of extreme events and modified weed, pest, and pathogen pressure are other factors.[107]: 282  Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture for livestock.[108] Loss and poor growth of livestock cause milk yield and meat production to decrease.[109] The rate of soil erosion is 10–20 times higher than the rate of soil accumulation in agricultural areas that use no-till farming. In areas with tilling it is 100 times higher. Climate change worsens this type of land degradation and desertification.[110]: 5 

Climate change is projected to negatively affect all four pillars of food security. It will affect how much food is available. It will also affect how easy food is to access through prices, food quality, and how stable the food system is.[111] Climate change is already affecting the productivity of wheat and other staples.[112][113]

Famine and hunger are both rooted in food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to famine and hunger; ensuring food security presupposes the elimination of that vulnerability.[9]

Food insecurity can force individuals to undertake risky economic activities such as prostitution.[116]

The International Monetary Fund cautioned in September 2022 that ""the impact of increasing import costs for food and fertilizer for those extremely vulnerable to food insecurity will add $9 billion to their balance of payments pressures – in 2022 and 2023."" This would deplete countries' foreign reserves as well as their capacity to pay for food and fertilizer imports.""[117][118]

Many countries experience ongoing food shortages and distribution problems. These result in chronic and often widespread hunger amongst significant numbers of people. Human populations can respond to chronic hunger and malnutrition by decreasing body size, known in medical terms as stunting or stunted growth.[10] This process starts in utero if the mother is malnourished and continues through approximately the third year of life. It leads to higher infant and child mortality, but at rates far lower than during famines.[119] Once stunting has occurred, improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage. Severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development.[11] It, therefore, creates a disparity a between children who did not experience severe malnutrition and those who experience it.[120]

Worldwide, the prevalence of child stunting was 21.3 percent in 2019, or 144 million children. Central Asia, Eastern Asia, and the Caribbean have the largest rates of reduction in the prevalence of stunting and are the only subregions on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 stunting targets.[121] Between 2000 and 2019, the global prevalence of child stunting declined by one-third.[122]

Data from the 2021 FAO SOFI showed that in 2020, 22.0 percent (149.2 million) of children under 5 years of age were affected by stunting, 6.7 percent (45.4 million) were suffering from wasting and 5.7 percent (38.9 million) were overweight. FAO warned that the figures could be even higher due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[5]

Africa and Asia account for more than nine out of ten of all children with stunting, more than nine out of ten children with wasting, and more than seven out of ten children who are affected by being overweight worldwide.[5]

Food insecurity is one of the social determinants of mental health. A recent comprehensive systematic review showed that over 50 studies have shown that food insecurity is strongly associated with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.[123] For depression and anxiety, food-insecure individuals have almost a threefold risk increase compared to food-secure individuals.[124] Adolescents experiencing food insecurity are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, suicide planning and suicide attempts than those who are food-secure.  This is more common in countries where food insecurity is less common, potentially because it indicates a reduced standard of living and low social standing within that country.[125]  Research has also found that food insecurity is linked to an increased risk of disordered eating behaviors.[126]

Resilient agrifood systems can achieve food security. The resilience of agrifood systems refers to the capacity over time of agrifood systems, in the face of any disruption, to sustainably ensure availability of and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for all, and sustain the livelihoods of agrifood systems' actors. Truly resilient agrifood systems must have a robust capacity to prevent, anticipate, absorb, adapt and transform in the face of any disruption, with the functional goal of ensuring food security and nutrition for all and decent livelihoods and incomes for agrifood systems' actors. Such resilience addresses all dimensions of food security, but focuses specifically on stability of access and sustainability, which ensure food security in both the short and the long term.[40] Resilience-building involves preparing for disruptions, particularly those that cannot be anticipated, in particular through: diversity in domestic production, in imports,[127][40] and in supply chains; robust food transport networks;[128][40] and guaranteed continued access to food for all.[129][40]

The FAO finds that there are six pathways to follow towards food systems transformation:[130]

Over the last decade, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has proposed a ""twin track"" approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure.[2] In general, FAO proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, vouchers for seeds, fertilizer, or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers is another approach promoted by FAO. Conditional transfers may include school feeding programs, while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, emergency food aid or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of subsidies as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. FAO has stated that ""approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty.""[131]

FAO has noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment. Bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security. Irrigation systems were established through infrastructure development programs.[3]

In 2020, FAO deployed intense advocacy to make healthy diets affordable as a way to reduce global food insecurity and save vast sums in the process. The agency said that if healthy diets were to become the norm, almost all of the health costs that can currently be blamed on unhealthy diets (estimated to reach US$1.3 trillion a year in 2030) could be offset; and that on the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions that are linked to unhealthy diets, the savings would be even greater (US$1.7 trillion, or over 70 percent of the total estimated for 2030).[132]

FAO urged governments to make nutrition a central plank of their agricultural policies, investment policies and social protection systems. It also called for measures to tackle food loss and waste, and to lower costs at every stage of food production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing. Another FAO priority is for governments to secure better access to markets for small-scale producers of nutritious foods.[132]

The World Summit on Food Security, held in Rome in 1996, aimed to renew a global commitment to the fight against hunger. The conference produced two key documents, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action.[7][133] The Rome Declaration called for the members of the United Nations to work to halve the number of chronically undernourished people on the Earth by 2015. The Plan of Action set several targets for government and non-governmental organizations for achieving food security, at the individual, household, national, regional, and global levels.[134]

Another World Summit on Food Security took place at the FAO's headquarters in Rome between November 16 and 18, 2009.[135]

FAO has also created a partnership that will act through the African Union's CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the Right to Food into national legislation.[136]

According to the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, a major study led by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), managing rainwater and soil moisture more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff.[137] Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes.[138]

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) proposes several key steps to increasing agricultural productivity, which is in turn key to increasing rural income and reducing food insecurity.[139] They include:


In September 2022, the United States announced a $2.9 billion contribution to aid efforts of global food security at the UN General Assembly in New York. $2 billion will go to the U.S. Agency for International Development for its humanitarian assistance efforts around the world, along with $140 million for the agency's Feed the Future Initiative. The United States Department of Agriculture will receive $220 million to fund eight new projects, all of which is expected to benefit nearly a million children residing in food-insecure countries in Africa and East Asia. The USDA will also receive another $178 million for seven international development projects to support U.S. government priorities on four continents.[140][141]
The World Food Programme (WFP) is an agency of the United Nations that uses food aid to promote food security and eradicate hunger and poverty. In particular, the WFP provides food aid to refugees and to others experiencing food emergencies. It also seeks to improve nutrition and quality of life to the most vulnerable populations and promote self-reliance.[142] An example of a WFP program is the ""Food For Assets"" program in which participants work on new infrastructure, or learn new skills, that will increase food security, in exchange for food.[143]

In April 2012, the Food Assistance Convention was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against malaria and AIDS.[144]

Food security could be increased by integrating alternative foods that can be grown in compact environments, that are resilient to pests and disease, and that do not require complex supply chains. Foods meeting these criteria include algae, mealworm, and fungi-derived mycoprotein. While unpalatable on their own to most people, such raw ingredients might be processed into more palatable foods.[145]

With over 2000 identified edible insects, there are many options for consumption. Insects may provide a sustainable option for protein sources containing 13-77% protein by dry weight. The energy obtained by eating insects can be similar to other food sources like beef and chicken depending on what kind of insect is eaten.[146] Insects may be a sustainable commercial farming option to support populations struggling with food security due to their nutrition and farming capacities, taking less room to cultivate than other protein sources.[147]

The Food Justice Movement is a multifaceted movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It has been described as a movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to environmental justice, improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities.[148]

In Afghanistan, about 35.5% of households are food insecure (as of 2018). The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting in children under five years of age is also very high.[149] In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage.[150] On 11 November 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system. The UN World Food Program has also issued multiple warnings of worsening food insecurity.[151]

In 2012, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducted a survey measuring nutrition, which included food security. It was reported that 4% of Australian households were food insecure.[152] 1.5% of those households were severely food insecure.[152] Additionally, the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), reported that certain demographics are more vulnerable to being food insecure; such as indigenous, elderly, regional, and single-parent households.[153] Financial issues were cited as the main cause of food insecurity.[152]

Climate change may present future challenges for Australia regarding food security, as Australia already experiences extreme weather. Australia's history in biofuel production and use of fertilizers has reduced the quality of the land.[154] Increased extreme weather is projected to affect crops, livestock, and soil quality.[155] Wheat production, one of Australia's main food exports, is projected to decrease by 9.2% by 2030.[156] Beef production is also expected to fall by 9.6%.[156]

Since 2005, Canada has monitored the level of food insecurity by province and territory. Rates of food insecurity in Canada ranged from 11.1% in Québec to 57% in Nunavut as of a 2017-2018 survey. Of the 57% of household affected by food insecurity in Nunavut, almost half of them are severely food insecure. These rates of food security equal 4.4 million people, of which 1.2 million were under the age of 18.[157] Some common co-occurring conditions were households with lower incomes, single-income, and renting rather than owning their home. Food insecurity is more prevalent in households that receive social assistance, Employment Insurance, and Worker's Compensation, as well as in pension-reliant homes. People who identified as Indigenous or Black also face higher rates of food insecurity than those who identify otherwise.[157]

Food insecurity has been associated with a poorer quality of diet including a significant difference in micronutrient intake which varies across age and sex. In a 2015 study, the caloric intake was higher in severely food insecure households however with fewer micronutrients indicating a shift towards less nutrient-dense food options. In addition to micronutrient deficiencies across all age groups, food insecurity is correlated with higher rates of chronic disease biomarkers. In Canada, food insecurity is associated with worse mental health and higher mortality rates.[157]

The persistence of wet markets has been described as ""critical for ensuring urban food security,""[158][159] particularly in Chinese cities.[160] The influence of wet markets on urban food security includes food pricing and physical accessibility.[160]

Calling food waste ""shameful"", General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, launched the Clean Plate campaign. Xi stressed that there should be a sense of crisis regarding food security. In 2020, China witnessed a rise in food prices, due to the COVID-19 outbreak and mass flooding that wiped out the country's crops, which made food security a priority for Xi.[161][162] As part of its goals of ensuring food security, the Chinese Communist Party emphasizes agricultural research, including at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[163]

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), about 33% of households are food insecure, and nearly 60% in eastern provinces.[164]  Millions of DRC inhabitants are living below the poverty line, contributing to this widespread hunger in the country that in some cases is so severe, that families can't afford to eat everyday.[165] A study showed the correlation of food insecurity and its negative effects on at-risk HIV adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo, exacerbating the vulnerability of these populations even further.[164]

The state of food insecurity in the DRC has been long prevalent, but worsened greatly following the Congolese Wars (1996–1998; 1998–2003). In 2002, about 80% of the population lived below the poverty line, and more than 90% of the rural population had no easy access to safe drinking water. This contributed to the food insecurity of the nation, in which chronic infant malnutrition was over 45% for children under 5 years old. The nation's lack of access to markets, limited financial means, and low levels of food production have been other contributors to their poor levels of food security.[166]

Furthermore, the nation has an influx of imported food products that are often of poor nutritional quality, but are placed at competitive prices that the nation can afford. This results in the majority of households turning to cheaper, high-calorie food products over more healthy, unaffordable, high-protein foods that are not as accessible to them. This then results in unbalanced and unhealthy diets that contribute to poor health outcomes for these populations. Furthermore, many urban areas are forced to turn to mainly consume bushmeat as their primary source of protein, because they cannot afford to access other types of safer, healthier and even more legal options.[167][168]

Singapore’s population increased from just over 3 million to around 5.7 million people (as of 2019). Following their significant increase in population, Singapore then faced a significant decrease in agricultural land (from 25% allocated land in 1965 to less than 1% in 2014) making food production rates decline drastically. Due to the minimal amount of agricultural output, Singapore imports about 90% of their food. Singapore was rated as the top country in affordability, availability, quality, and safety.[170] These conditions contribute to a high rate of food secure individuals, about 92.5% of the population have experienced no food security concerns.[171] A challenge with this structure is that importing food leaves the country’s food supply chain vulnerable to price changes in the global food market from factors such as, disease (like Coronavirus) and climate change which can cause droughts and floods disrupting agriculture in countries like Thailand which Singapore relies on.[170]

Singapore is implementing many different methods and techniques to increase internal agricultural output.[170]

In 2019 the Singapore government launched the ""30 by 30"" program which aims to drastically reduce food insecurity through hydroponics and aquaculture.[172][173]

In South Africa, between a quarter and a third of households are food insecure.[174] Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, child and household hunger have not decreased. In contrast, hunger has stabilized at a higher rate than pre-pandemic rates. This increase in hunger may be due to slow economic growth, low employment and a loss of government financial support following the pandemic.[175] The social grants given by the government along with the child support grants, school food initiatives, and the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Programme have all been influential in lowering the food insecurity rate particularly before the Coronavirus outbreak.[176]

Food insecurity and hunger in the United States of America affects millions of Americans, including some who are middle class, or who are in households where all adults are in work. The United States produces far more food than it needs for domestic consumption—hunger within the U.S. is caused by some Americans having insufficient money to buy food for themselves or their families. Additional causes of hunger and food insecurity include neighborhood deprivation and agricultural policy.[181][182] Hunger is addressed by a mix of public and private food aid provision. Public interventions include changes to agricultural policy, the construction of supermarkets in underserved neighborhoods, investment in transportation infrastructure, and the development of community gardens.[183][184][185][186] Private aid is provided by food pantries, soup kitchens, food banks, and food rescue organizations.[187][188][189]

Reliance on food banks has led to a rise in obesity and diabetes within the food insecure community.[190] Many foods in food banks are highly processed and low in nutritional value leading to further health effects. One study showed 33% of American households visiting food pantries had diabetes [191] Food insecure individuals living  in low-income communities experience higher rates of chronic disease, leading to healthcare costs and more financial hardships.[190]

Historically, the U.S. was a world leader in reducing hunger both domestically and internationally. In the latter half of the twentieth century, other advanced economies in Europe and Asia began to overtake the U.S. in terms of reducing hunger among their own populations. In 2011, a report presented in the New York Times found that among 20 economies recognized as advanced by the International Monetary Fund and for which comparative rankings for food security were available, the U.S. was joint worst.[192] Nonetheless, in March 2013, the Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security.[193] The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[194] finds that the US is achieving 87.6% of what should be possible at their income level for fulfilling the right to food.[195]

In 2022, 28% of Ugandan households experienced food insecurity. This insecurity has negative effects on HIV transmission and household stability.[116]

Uganda faces challenges associated with food security related to agricultural soil management, forest destruction, and anthropogenic pressure on the land. This is an issue as agriculture is the main form of food acquisition in places such as Tororo and Busia. In these areas the 90% of families rely on farming so disruptions to their farming could increase their chances of economic instability and food insecurity. Many families report that lack of funds, disease, and lack of land, among other variables, are significant barriers to food security.[200] In the wetlands system associated in Uganda, 93% of families are food insecure with 75% of inhabitants eating 2 meals and 8% eating only 1 meal a day. This was made worse by socioeconomic factors like disease (HIV/AIDS), poverty, and agricultural reasons like land degradation or management (regulation of food production using wetlands).[201]

Food insecurity is highly prevalent in Yemen, with 60% of the population being affected by agricultural decline. The Integrated Security Phase Classification system places 53% of Yemenis as at risk (36%) or as an emergency (17%). Between 23 and 30% of Yemenis must change their choice of food and compromise on the quality of their food to account for food shortages while 8 to 13% of Yemenis admit to decreasing the number of meals they eat. The state of nutrition is most dire for vulnerable populations like children who face developmental issues like stunting or wasting as a result of malnutrition. Over 462,000 Yemeni children are severely acutely malnourished which increases their risk of disease. In a 2019 study, children with severe acute malnutrition were reported to have an increased rate of measles, diarrhea, fever, and cough when compared to non-severely acutely malnourished children.[202]

October 16 has been chosen as World Food Day, in honour of the date FAO was founded in 1945. On this day, FAO hosts a variety of events at its headquarters in Rome and around the world, as well as seminars with UN officials.[203]

The United Nations (UN) recognized the Right to Food in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948,[2] and has since said that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights.[204]

The UN Millennium Development Goals were one of the initiatives aimed at achieving food security in the world. The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN ""is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty"" by 2015.[138] The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.[205]

Multiple different international agreements and mechanisms have been developed to address food security. The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty is in the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.[206] Although there has been some progress, the world is not on track to achieve the global nutrition targets, including those on child stunting, wasting and overweight by 2030.[122]

Let's dive into the economic aspects of agriculture today.

>>Nutritionist: Hi! I'm excited to discuss how our food systems impact nutrition.

>>Climate Scientist: Morning all. Looking forward to talking about climate impacts on agriculture.

>>Agricultural Economist: So, um, let's start by examining some recent market trends in agriculture. We've seen significant shifts due to policy changes and global events...

>>Nutritionist (interjects): And how those trends might be affecting dietary choices!

>>Climate Scientist: Exactly, especially considering recent weather patterns like droughts or floods that have been impacting crop yields.

>>Agricultural Economist: For instance, um, recent data shows a decline in wheat production due to extreme weather conditions. This not only affects prices but also has broader economic implications.

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! If staple foods like wheat become less available or more expensive, it could lead to poorer dietary choices among consumers. What strategies can we implement to mitigate this?

>>Climate Scientist: One approach is promoting sustainable farming practices that can withstand climate variability while maintaining crop yields. I recently visited a farm using innovative irrigation techniques to combat droughts effectively.

>>Agricultural Economist: Agreed. Policies should support farmers adopting these sustainable practices without causing financial strain on them. It's crucial for their livelihood and the economy.

>>Nutritionist: Definitely! I recently spoke with a farmer who had to switch crops due to droughts, which really impacted local food prices and availability. We need solutions that balance economic viability and nutritional quality.

>>Climate Scientist: And ensuring that environmental sustainability isn't compromised in the process is key too. We need holistic approaches that address all these aspects together. 
 >>Agricultural Economist: The economic dimension of food security is crucial. High food prices and market volatility can severely impact access to nutritious food, especially for vulnerable populations. Have you considered how trade policies might help mitigate these issues?

>>Nutritionist: From a nutrition perspective, food insecurity can really affect kids' growth and lead to chronic health issues like diabetes. Imagine the long-term impact on communities if we don't address this.

>>Climate Scientist: Yeah, and recent research shows that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, directly impacting crop yields. If we don't adapt our agricultural practices, how can we ensure our food systems remain resilient?

>>Agricultural Economist: That's a great point about climate change. We need economic stability in our food systems to handle these challenges. What role do you think trade policies could play here?

>>Nutritionist: I agree with you on the economic stability part, but we also need to think about community-based nutrition programs. Chronic food insecurity can lead to cognitive impairments and increased susceptibility to diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

>>Climate Scientist: And let's not forget the environmental aspect. Climate change isn't going away; it's only getting worse. We need sustainable farming practices now more than ever.

>>Agricultural Economist: Absolutely, sustainability is key. But we also need economic measures that support farmers without adding financial strain.

>>Nutritionist: Right, addressing mental health is also critical here. Constant stress from not knowing where your next meal comes from can lead to anxiety and depression. Shouldn't mental health support be part of our strategy too?

>>Climate Scientist: Definitely, mental health can't be overlooked when discussing food security strategies.

>>Agricultural Economist: So true. We need a holistic approach that includes economic stability, nutritional quality, environmental sustainability, and mental well-being. 
 >>Climate Scientist: Water scarcity and land degradation are big problems for our crops. If we don't fix this, food prices will keep going up. How can we manage water better?

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely, and with the added pressure from COVID-19, it's clear we need resilient agricultural practices too. What do you think about using more resilient farming methods to keep nutritious food available?

>>Agricultural Economist: I agree with both of you. High food prices and supply issues are making things worse for everyone. Have you thought about changing trade policies to help? Maybe lowering tariffs on key imports could make a difference.

>>Climate Scientist: That's a good point. We need innovative water management practices to address these issues effectively.

>>Nutritionist: And building on that, community-based nutrition programs could ensure people have access to nutritious food even during crises.

>>Agricultural Economist: Diversifying our import sources might also help mitigate risks. Establishing more trade agreements with emerging markets could be beneficial. 
 >>Nutritionist: Chronic malnutrition in children leads to stunted growth and cognitive development issues, impacting their ability to learn and thrive in school. It's really concerning because it affects their future opportunities.

>>Climate Scientist: That's a great point about education, Nutritionist. And from my side, extreme weather events are making it even harder for farmers. For example, last year’s severe droughts caused crop yields to drop by 30%, leading to significant food shortages.

>>Agricultural Economist: Exactly! When farmers struggle like that, it affects the whole economy. Malnutrition doesn't just reduce productivity; it also increases healthcare costs and puts pressure on public services. Have you thought about how this cycle of poverty and poor health can destabilize entire economies?

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely, it's a vicious cycle. Kids who are malnourished can't concentrate in school, which means they don't get the education they need to break out of poverty.

>>Climate Scientist: And if we don't act now to implement sustainable farming practices, these problems will only get worse. Extreme weather is becoming more frequent due to climate change, disrupting agricultural cycles even more.

>>Agricultural Economist: Right! Food insecurity has huge economic impacts. When people are malnourished, they can't work as effectively, which hurts the economy and increases poverty levels. Plus, there's the added strain on public resources trying to manage these crises. 
 >>Nutritionist: You know, from a nutritional standpoint, food insecurity doesn't just affect physical health but also mental well-being. Can you imagine the stress and anxiety of not knowing where your next meal is coming from? It's crucial to address both aspects.

>>Climate Scientist: Exactly! And that stress only gets worse with climate change making farming unpredictable. Extreme weather events like droughts and floods really mess up crop yields and damage the land. How can we mitigate these effects while ensuring sustainable farming practices?

>>Agricultural Economist: The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by FAO is a critical tool in measuring food insecurity globally. It allows us to produce cross-country comparable estimates, which are essential for understanding the prevalence of food insecurity and implementing effective policies. Have you ever considered how these measurements can influence policy decisions at both national and international levels?

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely, the FIES is really a game-changer. It helps us understand not just if people are hungry, but how their food insecurity affects their daily lives. Knowing these details can shape policies that directly improve both physical and mental health outcomes.

>>Climate Scientist: And from an environmental standpoint, understanding these impacts can help us develop more resilient agricultural practices. If we don't act now, degraded land will lead to lower yields—a vicious cycle that worsens food insecurity and further degrades our environment.

>>Agricultural Economist: That's right! The FIES can highlight regional differences in food insecurity, which is crucial for targeted interventions. These measurements aren't just numbers; they guide us in making informed policy decisions that can significantly impact people's lives.

>>Nutritionist: Right! The FIES gives us a comprehensive view of food insecurity—it's not just about hunger but also how it impacts daily life and mental health. What do you think about using this data to create more targeted nutrition programs?

>>Agricultural Economist: Definitely! The FIES not only provides a snapshot of food insecurity but also helps us understand its underlying causes like economic instability or regional conflicts. This data could be used to prioritize areas for international aid.

>>Nutritionist: Well yeah, if we know a specific region is struggling more with food insecurity, we can tailor interventions to address their unique needs. What do you think about integrating mental health support into these programs?

>>Climate Scientist: Considering the data we've discussed so far... it's clear that extreme weather events not only reduce crop yields but also lead to soil erosion and loss of biodiversity—further exacerbating the problem. We need to promote sustainable farming practices that can withstand extreme weather.

>>Agricultural Economist: Exactly! And those studies also highlight how economic factors play a role—for instance fluctuations in global markets or local economic policies impacting availability/accessibility of foods.

>>Nutritionist: Integrating mental health support into nutrition programs sounds fantastic! Addressing both physical and mental health creates a more holistic approach to tackling food insecurity. What do you think about incorporating community-based initiatives as well? 
 >>Agricultural Economist: Um, the recent data indicating a rise in global hunger due to conflicts is quite alarming. From an economic perspective, these conflicts not only disrupt food production but also inflate food prices, exacerbating poverty and limiting access to essential resources. This is particularly evident in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa where the agricultural sector is already under immense strain.

>>Climate Scientist: Yeah, from a climate perspective, these regions aren't just facing immediate food shortages; they're dealing with long-term problems like poor soil quality and lack of water because of extreme weather. How can we expect these regions to recover if we don't address these environmental challenges head-on?

>>Nutritionist: You know, gender inequality really exacerbates food insecurity. Women often have less access to resources like land and credit, which limits their ability to produce or purchase food. Can you imagine the impact on families when women can't provide adequate nutrition?

>>Agricultural Economist: In addition to what I mentioned earlier, we should also consider how these economic challenges are affecting local markets and smallholder farmers. For instance, many smallholder farmers are unable to afford seeds and fertilizers due to rising costs.

>>Climate Scientist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here, but building on what you said about gender inequality, it's crucial we also consider how climate change disproportionately affects women in agriculture.

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! That's a great point. Recent studies show that women in Sub-Saharan Africa are 20% less likely to own land compared to men, which significantly impacts their ability to produce food. Climate change adds another layer of complexity for women who are already facing significant barriers. 
 >>Climate Scientist: Recent research shows that climate change is really affecting food security with more frequent droughts and floods hitting our crops hard. How can we integrate adaptive practices like better water management and growing different types of crops to build resilience in our agrifood systems?

>>Agricultural Economist: That's a great point. We should also think about how these practices can be made scalable and accessible to smallholder farmers. For example, I've seen some success stories where small farmers adopted new irrigation techniques and saw significant improvements.

>>Nutritionist: I agree with both of you. And from a nutrition perspective, diversifying crops could really help improve diets in these communities. Imagine if we could introduce more nutrient-dense crops; it would make a huge difference in community health.

>>Climate Scientist: Exactly! The FAO's twin-track approach, which combines immediate hunger relief with long-term sustainable development efforts, seems like a solid strategy. But how do we ensure these strategies are practical for smallholder farmers?

>>Agricultural Economist: Well, the economic benefits are clear. By stabilizing food prices and ensuring a consistent supply chain, we can create new market opportunities for smallholder farmers. Have you ever considered how local markets could benefit from this stability?

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! And speaking from experience, when communities have access to a variety of nutrient-rich foods, their overall health improves dramatically. It's not just about quantity but quality too.

>>Climate Scientist: Right, so considering all this, how do you think we should prioritize adaptive practices like improved water management and crop diversification in our policies? 

>>Agricultural Economist: We need to focus on making these solutions practical and affordable for small farmers. Maybe we could look into subsidies or training programs that help them adopt these methods without too much financial strain.

>>Nutritionist: Yes, and let's not forget education on the nutritional benefits of diverse crops. If people understand the health advantages, they're more likely to support these changes. 
 >>Agricultural Economist: You know, Bangladesh's success in agricultural productivity growth is a prime example of how targeted policies and investments can transform an economy. By focusing on infrastructure development, particularly irrigation systems, and promoting high-yield crop varieties, they managed to significantly increase food production and improve food security. Have you considered how similar strategies could be adapted for other regions facing food insecurity?

>>Climate Scientist: That's a great point. From a climate perspective, Bangladesh's success is also tied to their adaptive strategies in response to climate change. They’ve implemented resilient agricultural practices that mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. If we don't act now to integrate such practices globally, we might face severe consequences.

>>Nutritionist: I see what you're saying. From a nutritional standpoint, Bangladesh's story is quite inspiring. By increasing agricultural productivity, they not only improved food security but also enhanced the overall dietary quality of their population. Imagine if we could replicate this in regions struggling with malnutrition.

>>Agricultural Economist: Absolutely! But let's think about specific challenges other regions might face. For instance, some areas lack the necessary infrastructure or have different climatic conditions. How do you think we could tailor these strategies to fit those unique circumstances?

>>Nutritionist: Well, one example that comes to mind is Ethiopia’s recent efforts in improving their irrigation systems which led to better crop yields and nutrition outcomes. It shows that with the right investments and policies, significant improvements are possible even in challenging environments.

>>Climate Scientist: Building on that idea, while Bangladesh's agricultural productivity growth is impressive, we must consider the environmental impact too. What if we don't ensure these strategies are sustainable? We need examples of how they've balanced productivity with environmental care.

>>Agricultural Economist: Good point! In fact, Bangladesh has been experimenting with salt-tolerant rice varieties due to rising sea levels affecting soil salinity. This kind of innovation could be crucial for other coastal regions facing similar issues.

>>Nutritionist: Exactly! And improving agricultural productivity can lead to better nutrition and healthier communities overall. But it's important to remember that each region will have its own set of challenges and opportunities.

>>Climate Scientist: Right! And speaking of challenges, economic stability plays a crucial role here too. But balancing it with environmental sustainability is key. Any thoughts on how we can achieve this balance?

>>Agricultural Economist: One approach could be integrating economic incentives for sustainable practices—like subsidies for farmers who adopt eco-friendly techniques or invest in renewable energy sources for their farms.

>>Nutritionist: That sounds promising! Plus, educating communities about the long-term benefits of sustainable agriculture can help drive adoption from the ground up.

>>Climate Scientist: Absolutely! It's all about creating a holistic strategy that addresses economic growth while preserving our environment for future generations. 
 >>Agricultural Economist: Have you thought about how subsidies could help farmers go green? By providing financial support for eco-friendly farming methods, we can make sure farmers are motivated and supported during the transition.

>>Nutritionist: It's fascinating how nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens can improve community health. I remember working with a local school to introduce more vegetables into their lunch program. The kids were initially hesitant, but once we started incorporating fun activities and education about the benefits, they became more enthusiastic. What do you think about integrating similar programs on a larger scale?

>>Climate Scientist: Looking at recent climate data, it's clear that extreme weather events are already happening more frequently. We need to act now by integrating adaptive practices like water management and crop diversification to build resilience in our agrifood systems.

>>Nutritionist: Well, it's really interesting how community-based nutrition programs can make a huge difference. I once worked with a local farmers' market to set up cooking demonstrations using seasonal produce. It was amazing to see how people started incorporating more vegetables into their meals just by learning simple recipes. What do you think about expanding such initiatives?

>>Agricultural Economist: Have you considered the economic impact of food insecurity on local economies? When communities face chronic hunger, productivity drops significantly, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty and reduced economic growth. What if we could implement targeted subsidies to support both farmers and consumers in these areas?

>>Climate Scientist: That's a great point about subsidies. How do you think we can ensure they reach smallholder farmers effectively? In my experience working with smallholder farmers, I've seen firsthand how effective subsidies can be when properly managed.

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! And those cooking demonstrations really showed me that hands-on education can change eating habits quickly.

>>Agricultural Economist: From an economic perspective, addressing food insecurity through targeted subsidies could break the cycle of poverty and boost local economies. 
 >>Climate Scientist: We really need to get moving on adaptive agricultural practices before things get worse. If we don't act now, the environmental impact will be catastrophic, leading to severe disruptions in food security. Let's prioritize sustainable farming methods and climate resilience strategies immediately.

>>Nutritionist: Educating communities about diverse crops can really boost health—plus, community gardens are a fun way to get people involved. For instance, programs in Detroit have shown how community gardens can improve dietary habits significantly. What do you think?

>>Agricultural Economist: That's a great idea! And if we combine that with financial incentives for farmers, like targeted subsidies for eco-friendly practices, we could see even greater benefits. This supports sustainable agriculture and enhances food security.

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! Furthermore, partnering with local schools for nutrition education can amplify our impact. Imagine integrating hands-on activities like community gardens into school curriculums?

>>Climate Scientist: Implementing adaptive agricultural practices that can withstand extreme weather events is critical. We must focus on water management and soil conservation techniques to ensure long-term sustainability. How can we integrate these strategies into our current policies effectively?

>>Agricultural Economist: In addition to targeted subsidies, we could explore tax incentives for farmers adopting eco-friendly practices. These measures would support sustainable agriculture and stabilize market prices.

>>Nutritionist: So, one key takeaway is that integrating nutrition education into community programs can have a profound impact. If we educate communities on diverse crops and incorporate hands-on activities like community gardens—

>>Climate Scientist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—I just remembered a case study from Detroit that perfectly illustrates your point about community gardens improving dietary habits.

>>Nutritionist: Absolutely! There are several initiatives globally where community gardens have led to improved dietary habits and local food security. For instance, in urban areas like Detroit and Nairobi, such projects have shown remarkable results.

>>Climate Scientist: That's great to hear! It really underscores how practical applications can make a difference.

>>Agricultural Economist: Indeed! And speaking of practical applications, those targeted subsidies for eco-friendly farming could be another game-changer for both farmers' livelihoods and environmental health."
