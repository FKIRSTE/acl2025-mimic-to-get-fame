Impressionism,"

Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, unusual visual angles, and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical 1874 review of the First Impressionist Exhibition published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.[1] The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as Impressionist music and Impressionist literature.

Radicals in their time, the early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as Eugène Delacroix and J. M. W. Turner. They also painted realistic scenes of everyday life in natural settings, often outdoors, attempting to capture a moment as experienced. 

Previously, paintings were accomplished in studio, whether landscape art, still life or portrait, with an emphasis on verisimilitude.[a] The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or en plein air. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short ""broken"" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.[2]

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the Macchiaioli, and Winslow Homer in the United States, were also exploring plein-air painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.[2] In 1876, the poet and critic Stéphane Mallarmé said of the new style: ""The represented subject, being composed of a harmony of reflected and ever-changing lights, cannot be supposed always to look the same but palpitates with movement, light, and life"".[4]

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style. By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.[5]

In the middle of the 19th century—a time of rapid industrialization and unsettling social change in France, as Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt Paris and waged war—the Académie des Beaux-Arts dominated French art.[6] The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.[7] Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a thick golden varnish.[8]

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the Salon de Paris, and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as Jean-Léon Gérôme and Alexandre Cabanel. Using an eclectic mix of techniques and formulas established in Western painting since the Renaissance—such as linear perspective and figure types derived from Classical Greek art—these artists produced escapist visions of a reassuringly ordered world.[9] By the 1850s, some artists, notably the Realist painter Gustave Courbet, had gained public attention and critical censure by depicting contemporary realities without the idealization demanded by the Académie.[10]

In the early 1860s, four young painters—Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille—met while studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice—pioneered by artists such as the Englishman John Constable—[11] that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air.[12] Their purpose was not to make sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom, but to complete their paintings out-of-doors.[13]

By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Courbet and the Barbizon school. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the Café Guerbois on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by Édouard Manet, whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.[14]

During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.[2] In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.[15] The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.[16]

Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Cézanne, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas and several other artists founded the Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs, etc.[b] to exhibit their artworks independently.[17][18] Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.[19] The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older Eugène Boudin, whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt plein air painting years before.[20] Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, Johan Jongkind, declined to participate, as did Édouard Manet. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer Nadar.

The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist Louis Leroy wrote a scathing review in the newspaper Le Charivari in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant), he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ""The Exhibition of the Impressionists"", Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialogue between viewers,

""Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.""[21]
The term Impressionist quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.[8]

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the ""purest"" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.[22] Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,[23] never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting Spanish Singer had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that ""the Salon is the real field of battle"" where a reputation could be made.[24]

Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.[25] Degas invited Mary Cassatt to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of Jean-François Raffaëlli, Ludovic Lepic, and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of ""opening doors to first-come daubers"".[26]

In this regard, the seventh Paris Impressionist exhibition in 1882 was the most selective of all including the works of only nine ""true"" impressionists, namely Gustave Caillebotte, Paul Gauguin, Armand Guillaumin, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Victor Vignon. The group then divided again over the invitations to Paul Signac and Georges Seurat to exhibit with them at the 8th Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, Durand-Ruel, played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.[27] Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.[28]

French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the Romantic colourist Eugène Delacroix; the leader of the realists, Gustave Courbet; and painters of the Barbizon school such as Théodore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned much from the work of Johan Barthold Jongkind, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eugène Boudin, who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as Frans Hals, Diego Velázquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.[29] Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.[30]

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium yellow, and synthetic ultramarine blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.[31] The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as cerulean blue,[8] which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.[31]

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.[32] By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.[32] By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.[33]

The Impressionists reacted to modernity by exploring ""a wide range of non-academic subjects in art"" such as middle-class leisure activities and ""urban themes, including train stations, cafés, brothels, the theater, and dance.""[34] They found inspiration in the newly widened avenues of Paris, bounded by new tall buildings that offered opportunities to depict bustling crowds, popular entertainments, and nocturnal lighting in artificially closed-off spaces.[35]

A painting such as Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day (1877) strikes a modern note by emphasizing the isolation of individuals amid the outsized buildings and spaces of the urban environment.[36] When painting landscapes, the Impressionists did not hesitate to include the factories that were proliferating in the countryside. Earlier painters of landscapes had conventionally avoided smokestacks and other signs of industrialization, regarding them as blights on nature's order and unworthy of art.[37]

Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such 17th-century Dutch painters as Jan Steen, had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of composition were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. J. M. W. Turner, while an artist of the Romantic era, anticipated the style of impressionism with his artwork.[38] The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.[39] Photography was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.[40][41]

The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography ""produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably"".[42]

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused ""on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated"".[42] The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their ""tacit imperatives of taste and conscience"".[43] Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: ""The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph"".[42]

Another major influence was Japanese ukiyo-e art prints (Japonism). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the ""snapshot"" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's Jardin à Sainte-Adresse, 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints.[45]

Edgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.[46] His The Dance Class (La classe de danse) of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the Little Dancer of Fourteen Years.

Impressionists, in varying degrees, were looking for ways to depict visual experience and contemporary subjects.[47] Female Impressionists were interested in these same ideals but had many social and career limitations compared to male Impressionists.[48] They were particularly excluded from the imagery of the bourgeois social sphere of the boulevard, cafe, and dance hall.[49]

As well as imagery, women were excluded from the formative discussions that resulted in meetings in those places. That was where male Impressionists were able to form and share ideas about Impressionism.[49] In the academic realm, women were believed to be incapable of handling complex subjects, which led teachers to restrict what they taught female students.[50] It was also considered unladylike to excel in art, since women's true talents were then believed to center on homemaking and mothering.[50]

Yet several women were able to find success during their lifetime, even though their careers were affected by personal circumstances – Bracquemond, for example, had a husband who was resentful of her work which caused her to give up painting.[51] The four most well known, namely, Mary Cassatt, Eva Gonzalès, Marie Bracquemond, and Berthe Morisot, are, and were, often referred to as the 'Women Impressionists'. Their participation in the series of eight Impressionist exhibitions that took place in Paris from 1874 to 1886 varied: Morisot participated in seven, Cassatt in four, Bracquemond in three, and Gonzalès did not participate.[51][52]


The critics of the time lumped these four together without regard to their personal styles, techniques, or subject matter.[53] Critics viewing their works at the exhibitions often attempted to acknowledge the women artists' talents but circumscribed them within a limited notion of femininity.[54] Arguing for the suitability of Impressionist technique to women's manner of perception, Parisian critic S.C. de Soissons wrote:
One can understand that women have no originality of thought, and that literature and music have no feminine character; but surely women know how to observe, and what they see is quite different from that which men see, and the art which they put in their gestures, in their toilet, in the decoration of their environment is sufficient to give is the idea of an instinctive, of a peculiar genius which resides in each one of them.[55]
While Impressionism legitimized the domestic social life as subject matter, of which women had intimate knowledge, it also tended to limit them to that subject matter. Portrayals of often-identifiable sitters in domestic settings, which could offer commissions, were dominant in the exhibitions.[56] The subjects of the paintings were often women interacting with their environment by either their gaze or movement. Cassatt, in particular, was aware of her placement of subjects: she kept her predominantly female figures from objectification and cliche; when they are not reading, they converse, sew, drink tea, and when they are inactive, they seem lost in thought.[57]

The women Impressionists, like their male counterparts, were striving for ""truth"", for new ways of seeing and new painting techniques; each artist had an individual painting style.[58] Women Impressionists, particularly Morisot and Cassatt, were conscious of the balance of power between women and objects in their paintings – the bourgeois women depicted are not defined by decorative objects, but instead, interact with and dominate the things with which they live.[59] There are many similarities in their depictions of women who seem both at ease and subtly confined.[60] Gonzalès' Box at the Italian Opera depicts a woman staring into the distance, at ease in a social sphere but confined by the box and the man standing next to her. Cassatt's painting Young Girl at a Window is brighter in color but remains constrained by the canvas edge as she looks out the window.

Despite their success in their ability to have a career and Impressionism's demise attributed to its allegedly feminine characteristics—its sensuality, dependence on sensation, physicality, and fluidity—the four women artists, and other, lesser-known women Impressionists, were largely omitted from art historical textbooks covering Impressionist artists until Tamar Garb's Women Impressionists published in 1986.[61] For example, Impressionism by Jean Leymarie, published in 1955 included no information on any women Impressionists.

The central figures in the development of Impressionism in France,[63][64] listed alphabetically, were:

The Impressionists

Among the close associates of the Impressionists, Victor Vignon is the only artist outside the group of prominent names who participated to the most exclusive Seventh Paris Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, which was indeed a rejection to the previous less restricted exhibitions chiefly organized by Degas. Originally from the school of Corot, Vignon was a friend of Camille Pissarro, whose influence is evident in his impressionist style after the late 1870s, and a friend of post-impressionist Vincent van Gogh.

There were several other close associates of the Impressionists who adopted their methods to some degree. These include Jean-Louis Forain, who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886,[68] and Giuseppe De Nittis, an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.[69] Federico Zandomeneghi was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. Eva Gonzalès was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. 

James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. Walter Sickert, an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas. He did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904, the artist and writer Wynford Dewhurst wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development, which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as Jean Béraud and Henri Gervex found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.[70] Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like J.D. Kirszenbaum were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:

While Edgar Degas was primarily known as a painter in his lifetime, he began to pursue the medium of sculpture later in his artistic career in the 1880s. He created as many as 150 sculptures during his lifetime. Degas preferred the medium of wax for his sculptures because it allowed him to make changes, start over, and further explore the modelling process.[74] Only one of Degas's sculptures, Little Dancer of Fourteen Years, was exhibited in his lifetime, which was exhibited at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition in 1881. Little Dancer proved to be controversial with critics. Some considered Degas to have overthrown sculptural traditions in the same way that Impressionism had overthrown the traditions of painting. Others found it to be ugly. [75] Following the Degas's death in 1917, his heirs authorized bronze castings from 73 of the artist's sculptures.[76]

The sculptor Auguste Rodin is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.[77] The sculptor Medardo Rosso has also been called an Impressionist.[78]

Some Russian artists created Impressionistic sculptures of animals in order to break away from old world concepts. Their works have been described as endowing birds and beasts with new spiritual characteristics.[79]

While his photographs are less known than his paintings or his sculptures, Edgar Degas also pursued photography later in his life. His photographs were never exhibited during his lifetime, and not much attention was given to them following his death. It was not until the late 20th century that scholars started to take interest in Degas's photographs.[80]

Pictorialist photographers, whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects, have also been called Impressionists. These Impressionist photographers used various techniques such as photographing subjects out of focus, using soft focus lenses or pinhole lenses, and manipulating the gum bichromate process to create images that resembled Impressionist paintings.[81]

French Impressionist Cinema is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919 to 1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Germaine Dulac, Marcel L'Herbier, Louis Delluc, and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in European classical music that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the Romantic era. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the nocturne, arabesque, and prelude, and often explored uncommon scales such as the whole tone scale. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. Erik Satie was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. 

Paul Dukas is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as Ottorino Respighi (Italy), Ralph Vaughan Williams, Cyril Scott, and John Ireland (England), Manuel De Falla and Isaac Albeniz (Spain), and Charles Griffes (America).

American Impressionist music differs from European Impressionist music, and these differences are mainly reflected in Charles Griffith's poetry of flute and orchestral music. He is also the most prolific Impressionist composer in the United States.[82]

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to Symbolism, with its major exemplars being Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. Authors such as Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life. Some literary scholars, such as John G. Peters, believe literary Impressionism is better defined by its philosophical stance than by any supposed relationship with Impressionist painting.[83]

During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Post-Impressionist artists reacted against the Impressionists' concern with realistically reproducing the optical sensations of light and colour; they turned instead toward symbolic content and the expression of emotion.[84]

Post-Impressionism prefigured the characteristics of Futurism and Cubism, reflecting the change of attitude towards art in European society.[85] Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; Camille Pissarro briefly painted in a pointillist manner, and even Monet abandoned strict plein air painting. Paul Cézanne, who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.

Key characteristics of this movement included small, visible brush strokes, open composition, and an emphasis on light and ordinary subjects. Originating in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s, Impressionism faced initial opposition from the French art community but gradually gained acceptance. The term 'Impressionism' was coined by critic Louis Leroy after Claude Monet's work 'Impression, Sunrise.' Early Impressionists like Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Bazille painted en plein air to capture natural light and movement. Despite rejections from traditional art institutions like the Salon de Paris, they formed their own exhibitions starting in 1874. The style influenced various other media including music and literature. Notable figures such as Manet, Pissarro, Degas, and Morisot contributed significantly to its development. Women artists also played a crucial role despite facing societal limitations. Over time, Impressionism paved the way for Post-Impressionism and other modern art movements.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting and Setting the Tone\nTLDR: Participants greet each other and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Brief mention of today's topic: Impressionism\n- Reminder of the meeting objectives: build rapport, share updates, discuss non-work topics"", ""Scene 2: Personal Updates and Catch-Up\nTLDR: Participants share personal updates to strengthen team relationships.\n- Each participant shares a recent personal experience or update\n- Encourage spontaneous questions and comments from others\n- Allow brief off-topic moments to keep it natural"", ""Scene 3: Introduction to Impressionism\nTLDR: Art Historian provides an overview of Impressionism.\n- Key characteristics of Impressionism (brush strokes, light, ordinary subjects)\n- Mention of Paris origins in the 1870s and 1880s\n- Initial opposition from French art community"", ""Scene 4: Discussion on Key Figures in Impressionism\nTLDR: Participants discuss notable figures like Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Bazille.\n- Contributions of early Impressionists\n- Formation of their own exhibitions starting in 1874\n- Influence on other media including music and literature"", ""Scene 5: Women in Impressionism\nTLDR: Highlighting the role of women artists despite societal limitations.\n- Contributions by women artists such as Morisot\n- Challenges faced by women in the art world at that time"", ""Scene 6: Impact on Modern Art Movements\nTLDR: Discussing how Impressionism paved the way for Post-Impressionism and modern art.\n- Transition from Impressionism to Post-Impressionism\n- Influence on contemporary art practices"", ""Scene 7: Open Floor for Spontaneous Discussion\nTLDR: Allow participants to bring up any related or unrelated topics.\n- Encourage sharing personal experiences related to art or creativity\n- Open floor for any spontaneous contributions or questions"", ""Scene 8: Wrap-Up and Final Thoughts\nTLDR: Summarize key points discussed and share final thoughts.\n- Recap main takeaways from the discussion on Impressionism \n - Each participant shares a final thought or takeaway \n - Thank everyone for their participation""]",">>Art Historian: Hi everyone! How's it going? I'm really excited to dive into Impressionism today. It's such an exciting period in art history. Before we get into it, does anyone have any recent updates or experiences they'd like to share?

>>Art Educator: Hi all! I've been good. Has anyone seen any interesting exhibitions or read any good books lately? It's always fun to hear what everyone's been up to!

>>Art Critic: Honestly, I haven't had much time for exhibitions lately, but I did come across an interesting article on the influence of Japanese ukiyo-e prints on Impressionism. It's fascinating how those bold compositions and unique perspectives found their way into the works of Monet and Degas.

>>Artist: Hello! I've been experimenting with some Impressionist techniques in my work recently. Those short, broken brush strokes can really bring a piece to life! Has anyone else tried these methods?

>>Museum Curator: I checked out this exhibition on light in Impressionist works last week—it was amazing how they showed different times of day.

>>Art Historian: The interplay of light in Impressionist works is truly fascinating.

>>Art Critic: Yes, it's almost as if they were painting the very essence of a moment.

>>Museum Curator: And it's not just about capturing light; it's also about responding to rapid industrialization and social changes at that time.

>>Art Educator: Oh, that's so interesting! Exhibition design can really enhance our understanding of art. When you see a painting in different lighting or settings, it can completely change your perception of it.

>>Artist: Absolutely! In my studio, I've been experimenting with capturing fleeting effects of light using those short brush strokes. It's like trying to freeze a moment in time on canvas. 
 >>Art Educator: So, I recently had this fun experience with my students. We decided to do an outdoor painting session at the park. It was amazing to see how they captured the changing light throughout the day. You know, it's moments like these that remind me why I love teaching art.

>>Art Historian: Oh, that sounds wonderful! You know, I recently visited a small village in Provence. The light there is simply magical and reminded me so much of the landscapes captured by the Impressionists. It's fascinating how certain places can evoke such strong connections to art history.

>>Art Critic: Speaking of light, I had a rather amusing experience last weekend at a local art fair. There was this artist who had an entire series dedicated to capturing morning light. Each piece varied just by the time of day—those subtle differences are what make Impressionism so captivating.

>>Artist: That's really interesting! Actually, I've been experimenting in my studio with capturing fleeting effects of light using short, broken brush strokes. The way the colors blend and vibrate on the canvas has brought a new dimension to my work.

>>Museum Curator: That sounds fantastic! Um, I recently visited a new exhibition space we're considering for our next Impressionist showcase. The lighting there is phenomenal; it really brings out the vibrancy of the colors in a way that's almost magical. It's these little details in exhibition design that can truly transform how we experience art.

>>Art Historian: Indeed! You know, I stumbled upon an old journal from the 19th century detailing daily lives of artists in Montmartre. It's fascinating to see how their personal experiences and historical context influenced their work. There were even some amusing anecdotes about Monet and Renoir's friendly rivalry.

>>Art Critic: Oh, that's intriguing! Those personal stories add so much depth to our understanding of their work.

>>Artist: Absolutely! And you know what? I've been thinking about incorporating more historical context into my pieces too—like blending modern techniques with classic themes.

>>Art Educator: That's a great idea! It could really resonate with people who appreciate both contemporary and traditional art forms.

>>Museum Curator: Yes, definitely! And speaking of blending styles, have any of you seen that recent exhibit on neo-Impressionism? It’s quite something! 
 >>Art Historian: You know, the origins of Impressionism in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s were quite revolutionary. Artists like Monet and Renoir started painting outside to catch real-life scenes and light effects, which was pretty groundbreaking back then. They faced a lot of pushback from traditionalists but ended up changing the art world forever.

>>Art Critic: I agree with you, Art Historian. The initial opposition was almost laughable, but it also highlighted how entrenched the Académie des Beaux-Arts was in its ways. This resistance actually pushed the Impressionists to innovate even more.

>>Art Educator: Absolutely! These artists weren't just rebels; they were visionaries who saw beauty in everyday life and light. Imagine trying to capture a bustling Paris street or serene countryside with quick brush strokes—no wonder they faced such fierce opposition!

>>Artist: From an artist's perspective, experimenting with these techniques is truly fascinating. In my studio, I try to emulate their spontaneity by painting quickly to capture the essence of a moment. It's challenging but incredibly rewarding when it works out.

>>Museum Curator: Designing an exhibition on Impressionism is challenging but rewarding because we get to highlight those innovative techniques. We often use dynamic lighting and open spaces to mimic that outdoor painting experience, which really helps visitors connect with the art.

>>Art Historian: And let's not forget that this wasn't just about taste; it was deeply rooted in the socio-political context of the time. The Académie des Beaux-Arts upheld traditional values being challenged by rapid industrialization and social change.

>>Art Critic: Exactly, Art Historian. The clash between tradition and modernity was inevitable given how fast society was changing back then.

>>Art Educator: It's interesting to think about how these artists were pushing boundaries not just in art but also in how people viewed their world. They made us see beauty in everyday moments that we might otherwise overlook.

>>Artist: One time, I tried painting during sunset just like Monet did—it was tough but incredibly rewarding when I saw how the colors came alive on canvas. It gave me a whole new appreciation for what they achieved. 
 >>Art Historian: You know, Monet's dedication to capturing how light changes throughout the day was truly revolutionary. His work, along with that of Renoir and Sisley, marked a significant departure from the academic norms of their time. They weren't just painting landscapes; they were painting moments—fleeting instances of beauty that could never be replicated.

>>Art Critic: Absolutely, and what's fascinating is how this approach laid the foundation for modern art. These artists defied academic conventions and embraced spontaneity. I mean, think about ""Impression, Sunrise""—it wasn't just a painting; it was a statement against traditional art forms.

>>Art Educator: Right! And imagine being in Paris back then and seeing one of their exhibitions for the first time. It must have been mind-blowing to see such vibrant colors and dynamic brushstrokes. They really had to fight against traditionalists to get their work seen. It's like they were saying, 'Hey, look at the world through our eyes!' That spirit of innovation is what makes their work so engaging even today.

>>Artist: From an artist's perspective, what really stands out about Monet and his peers is their relentless pursuit of capturing light in new ways. In my studio, I often experiment with those same techniques—short, broken brush strokes and vibrant colors—to convey the fleeting beauty of a moment. It's amazing how these methods can transform a simple scene into something truly magical!

>>Museum Curator: And from a curatorial standpoint, it's not just about technique but also about creating an environment that mirrors their intent. When we curate exhibitions on Impressionism, we often have to consider lighting that mimics natural sunlight to bring out the vibrancy and transient beauty of their works. This helps visitors experience those fleeting moments that these artists so masterfully depicted.

>>Art Historian: The formation of their own exhibitions starting in 1874 was a bold move that signified their break from traditional academic constraints. This act allowed them to showcase their innovative techniques without limitations imposed by the Salon. It wasn't just about exhibiting art; it was about creating a new artistic identity and challenging the status quo.

>>Art Critic: Exactly! And this shift wasn't just technical; it changed how we perceive reality itself. Their work laid the groundwork for modern art by challenging what art could be.

>>Art Educator: Let me share an interesting anecdote—Monet once painted the Rouen Cathedral over thirty times at different times of day to capture its changing appearance under various lighting conditions. Imagine walking through Paris in the late 1800s and stumbling upon one of his series—it wasn't just art on walls; it was an experience that challenged everything you thought you knew about painting.

>>Artist: That's incredible! What really stands out is how they captured light differently throughout the day! In my studio, I try similar techniques—using short brush strokes and vibrant colors—to convey fleeting beauty in my own way.

>>Museum Curator: Indeed! Creating an exhibition space that reflects this spontaneity requires meticulous attention to detail—from lighting to spatial arrangement—so visitors can truly experience ephemeral beauty as intended by these pioneering artists. 
 >>Art Historian: You know, despite the societal constraints of the time, women like Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt managed to carve out significant spaces for themselves within the Impressionist movement. Their works often depicted intimate domestic scenes, which were both a reflection of their lived experiences and a subtle critique of their limited roles in society. Does that make sense?
>>Art Critic: It's amazing how they turned their personal experiences into powerful statements against societal norms.
>>Art Educator: Yeah, they really brought a new perspective to everyday scenes. Imagine this: Morisot and Cassatt painting everyday life with such depth and emotion that they questioned the roles assigned to them.
>>Artist: I love how they used light and shadow to add depth to those moments. In my studio—
>>Museum Curator: That's interesting! From a curatorial standpoint, we aim to highlight those elements in our exhibitions too.
>>Artist: Exactly! In my studio, I try to capture that same essence by focusing on light and shadow. They were painting not just what they saw but what they felt.
>>Museum Curator: We try to create exhibits that really draw people into their world using themes and immersive setups. Does that make sense?
>>Art Historian: Indeed! The resilience and ingenuity of women like Morisot and Cassatt in navigating the male-dominated art world is truly remarkable.
>>(Phone rings briefly)
>>Art Critic (smiling): Oops, someone's phone is still on!
>>(Everyone chuckles)
>>Art Historian (smiling): Anyway, as I was saying—their ability to infuse personal experiences into their work provided a unique perspective while subtly challenging societal norms. 
 >>Art Historian: You know, the transition from Impressionism to Post-Impressionism was quite fascinating. Artists like Van Gogh and Gauguin took the foundation laid by the Impressionists and pushed it further, exploring more symbolic content and emotional expression. They weren't just capturing light but delving into the deeper essence of their subjects.

>>Art Critic: Absolutely, but I think Van Gogh's use of color was revolutionary; he used it not just to depict reality but to convey his inner turmoil. It wasn't just about pushing boundaries—it was about breaking them entirely.

>>Art Educator: And Gauguin's work in Tahiti introduced new cultural elements into Western art, which was groundbreaking at the time. Without those bold moves by artists like him, we might not have seen movements like Fauvism or Cubism emerge.

>>Artist: You know, when I paint, I try to channel that same kind of raw emotion that Van Gogh did. It's not just about what you see but what you feel. His approach really changed how we think about art today.

>>Museum Curator: From a curatorial perspective, it's crucial to design exhibitions that reflect these profound changes. When curating an exhibition that bridges Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, it's important to create spaces that allow viewers to experience the emotional depth and symbolic content introduced by artists like Van Gogh and Gauguin. Have any of you tried incorporating digital elements in your exhibits?

>>Art Historian: That's an interesting point about digital elements. How do you think Gauguin's time in Tahiti influenced his work?

>>Art Critic: Well, while his time in Tahiti added a unique cultural dimension to his art, some argue that it also romanticized and oversimplified those cultures. But there's no denying it brought something fresh to Western art.

>>Artist: I see your point about romanticizing other cultures, but I think Gauguin's work still opened up new avenues for artistic exploration. In my studio work today—um—I try incorporating those same principles of capturing emotion along with light.

>>Museum Curator: And when we design exhibitions now—like—you can see how important it is to reflect those changes thoughtfully through our setups so visitors can fully appreciate both historical context & innovative techniques used back then! Have any of you experimented with interactive elements? 
 >>Artist: You know, in my studio, I've been experimenting with different light sources to mimic the natural lighting that Impressionists were so fascinated by. It's incredible how just changing the angle of a lamp can transform the mood of a piece! 

>>Art Educator: Oh, speaking of light and its impact on art, one of my students was struggling with capturing natural light in her paintings. So, we took our class outdoors during sunset. It really helped her understand how to work with natural light.

>>Art Historian: That's interesting because it reminds me of how Monet and Renoir captured modern life during a time of rapid change in France. They weren't just painting pretty pictures; they were reflecting the essence of their era.

>>Art Critic: Absolutely. Their use of short, broken brush strokes was a direct challenge to traditional techniques. This rebellion against convention is what truly set them apart.

>>Art Educator: Speaking from experience, I once had my class recreate Monet's garden in our schoolyard. The students loved trying to capture the light and colors like Monet did. It was quite an engaging session.

>>Artist: Actually, I recently tried painting with my non-dominant hand to capture spontaneity and unpredictability. It was challenging but incredibly freeing!

>>Museum Curator: That's really interesting! In curatorial practice, we often try to create immersive experiences for visitors that reflect these artistic experiments. For instance, we've used interactive elements like augmented reality to show how different lighting affects artworks.

>>Art Critic: While focusing on light and brush strokes is important, let's not forget the sheer audacity these artists had by painting everyday scenes with such raw immediacy.

>>Art Historian: Indeed! The historical context isn't just about art itself but also about societal shifts it mirrored during late 19th century France—rapid industrialization and urbanization influenced artists to capture fleeting moments much like snapshots in time.

>>Artist: You know what? I once tried painting with a palette knife instead of brushes to capture texture and spontaneity—it was messy but incredibly fun!

>>Art Educator: Speaking about pushing boundaries—another project I did with my students involved creating art using unconventional materials like leaves or even coffee! The classroom smelled amazing while students experimented with textures—it ended up being displayed at our school gallery! 
 >>Art Historian: Well, as we wrap up our discussion on Impressionism, it's fascinating to reflect on how this movement not only revolutionized the art world but also mirrored the rapid societal changes of 19th-century France. The way artists like Monet and Renoir captured the fleeting effects of light and modern life was truly groundbreaking. Their defiance against academic norms paved the way for future art movements.

>>Art Critic: Absolutely, breaking away from rigid academic norms was revolutionary. This defiance against tradition is what paved the way for modern art movements. Without their bold experimentation with light and color, we might not have seen the same level of innovation in subsequent art forms.

>>Art Educator: Adding to that, Impressionism also democratized art by focusing on ordinary scenes and capturing moments that everyone could relate to. Students today can still learn so much from these techniques, like painting en plein air to understand light and color better.

>>Artist: From an artist's perspective, these techniques have been incredibly influential in my work. I often experiment with different light sources in my studio to mimic natural lighting conditions. This practical application allows me to create pieces that feel alive and dynamic.

>>Museum Curator: Designing exhibits that capture the essence of Impressionism's focus on light takes a lot of careful planning. Using natural lighting or simulating it with modern technology can profoundly impact how viewers experience these works.

>>Art Historian: The historical context of Impressionism is crucial to understanding its impact. The movement emerged during a time of rapid industrialization and societal change in France, which is reflected in how artists like Monet and Renoir captured modern life with their innovative techniques.

>>Art Critic: Honestly, the way Impressionism challenged traditional norms and embraced modernity makes it so enduring. Their bold use of light and color transformed art and influenced countless future movements.

>>Art Educator: I agree with what you said about democratizing art. It's amazing how students today can still learn so much from these techniques—it's like stepping into Monet or Renoir's shoes!

>>Artist: That's a great point about exhibition design! I've noticed how effective lighting can really change how my work is perceived.

>>Museum Curator: In summary, it's clear that Impressionism has had a lasting impact not just on artists but also on how we present art today."
