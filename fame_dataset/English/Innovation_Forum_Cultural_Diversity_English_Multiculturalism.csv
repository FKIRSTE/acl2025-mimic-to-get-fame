Multiculturalism,"

Multiculturalism is the coexistence of multiple cultures. The word is used in sociology, in political philosophy, and colloquially. In sociology and everyday usage, it is usually a synonym for ethnic or cultural pluralism[1] in which various ethnic and cultural groups exist in a single society. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist or a single country. Groups associated with an indigenous, aboriginal or autochthonous ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.[2]

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world.

In reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as a state's capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely.[3] It has been described as a ""salad bowl"" and as a ""cultural mosaic"",[4] in contrast to a ""melting pot"".[5]

States that embody multicultural ideals have arguably existed since ancient times. The Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures.[6]

A historical example of multiculturalism was the Habsburg monarchy, which had broken up in 1918 and under whose roof many different ethnic, linguistic and religious groups lived together. The Habsburg rule was mired in controversy, including events such as the mass murder committed against Székelys by the Habsburg army in 1764 and the destruction of Romanian Orthodox Churches and Monasteries in Transylvania by Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow.[7] Both events had happened during the rule of Maria Theresa. Today's topical issues such as social and cultural differentiation, multilingualism, competing identity offers or multiple cultural identities have already shaped the scientific theories of many thinkers of this multi-ethnic empire.[8] After the First World War, ethnic minorities were disadvantaged, forced to emigrate or even murdered in most regions in the area of the former Habsburg monarchy due to the prevailing nationalism at the time. In many areas, these ethnic mosaics no longer exist today. The ethnic mix of that time can only be experienced in a few areas, such as in the former Habsburg port city of Trieste.[9]

In the political philosophy of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and Christian differences. It is often associated with ""identity politics"", ""the politics of difference"", and ""the politics of recognition"". It is also a matter of economic interests and political power.[10] In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as African Americans and the LGBT community, with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, indigenous peoples and even people with disabilities. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a melting pot or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western nation-states, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.[11]
Multiculturalism has been official policy in several Western nations since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,[12][13][14] including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.[15]

The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration.[16][17] The Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.[18] Canada has provided provisions to the French speaking majority of Quebec, whereby they function as an autonomous community with special rights to govern the members of their community, as well as establish French as one of the official languages. In the Western English-speaking countries, multiculturalism as an official national policy started in Canada in 1971, followed by Australia in 1973 where it is maintained today.[19][20][21][22] It was quickly adopted as official policy by most member-states of the European Union. Recently, right-of-center governments in several European states – notably the Netherlands and Denmark – have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism.[23] A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom, among others, due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over ""home-grown"" terrorism.[24] Several heads-of-state or heads-of-government have expressed doubts about the success of multicultural policies: The United Kingdom's ex-Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Australia's ex-prime minister John Howard, Spanish ex-prime minister José María Aznar and French ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of their multicultural policies for integrating immigrants.[25][26]

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a descriptive sense. In some, ethnic communalism is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or mono-ethnic nation-building – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.[27]

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.[32] They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the ""human rights revolution"", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and ethnic cleansing became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the Holocaust; with the collapse of the European colonial system, as colonized nations in Africa and Asia successfully fought for their independence and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, which criticized ideals of assimilation that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic ethnic studies programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.[33][34] As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the liberalism that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the Age of Enlightenment. The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well-documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

Will Kymlicka argues for ""group differentiated rights"", that help both religious and cultural minorities operate within the larger state as a whole, without impinging on the rights of the larger society. He bases this on his opinion that human rights fall short in protecting the rights of minorities, as the state has no stake in protecting the minorities.[35]

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it ""uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.[36] By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a postmodern era that fragments human life and thought.""[36]

Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism ""is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less"", since it is ""the form of integration"" that (1) best fits the ideal of egalitarianism, (2) has ""the best chance of succeeding"" in the ""post-9/11, post 7/7"" world, and (3) has remained ""moderate [and] pragmatic"".[37]

Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities ""demanding special rights"" and to see these as promoting a ""thinly veiled racis[m]"". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact ""not about minorities"" but ""is about the proper terms of the relationship between different cultural communities"", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., ""the principles of justice"" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come ""through an open and equal dialogue between them.""[38]

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as ""differentialist racism"", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived ""incompatibility of life-styles and traditions"".[39]

While there is research that suggests that ethnic diversity increases chances of war, lower public goods provision and decreases democratization, there is also research that shows that ethnic diversity in itself is not detrimental to peace,[40][41] public goods provision[42][43] or democracy.[44] Rather, it was found that promoting diversity actually helps in advancing disadvantaged students.[45] A 2018 study in the American Political Science Review cast doubts on findings that ethnoracial homogeneity led to greater public goods provision.[46] A 2015 study in the American Journal of Sociology challenged past research showing that racial diversity adversely affected trust.[47]

According to migration researcher Hein de Haas, research shows that there is no systematic relationship between levels of immigration or ethnic diversity and social cohesion or trust. Studies show that factors such as economic inequality and trust in government are much more important for social cohesion than diversity. In countries and regions where income inequality is low and where people trust their government, social cohesion remains strong even with high levels of diversity. Canada and Australia, for example, are countries with high levels of immigration and diversity, but also with stable and well-functioning societies. On the other hand, hate speech toward minority groups by politicians can reduce social cohesion. So diversity as such does not undermine social cohesion, hate speech by politicians does.[48]

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable.[49][50][51] It is argued that nation states, who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture.[52]

Sarah Song views cultures as historically shaped entities by its members, and that they lack boundaries due to globalization, thereby making them stronger than others might assume.[53] She goes on to argue against the notion of special rights as she feels cultures are mutually constructive, and are shaped by the dominant culture. Brian Barry advocates a difference-blind approach to culture in the political realm and he rejects group-based rights as antithetical to the universalist liberal project, which he views as based on the individual.[54]

Susan Moller Okin, a feminist professor of political philosophy, argued in 1999, in ""Is multiculturalism bad for women?"", that the principle that all cultures are equal means that the equal rights of women in particular are sometimes severely violated.[55]

Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust.[56] He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities ""don't trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don't trust institutions,"" writes Putnam.[57] In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that, ""[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it's not just that we don't trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don't trust people who do not look like us"".[56] Putnam has also stated, however, that ""this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better.""[58] Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been ""twisted"" to make a case against race-conscious admissions to universities. He asserted that his ""extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.""[59]

Ethnologist Frank Salter writes:

Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies  [sic]. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.[60]

Dick Lamm, former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of Colorado, argued that ""diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent.""[61]

The American classicist Victor Davis Hanson used the perceived differences in ""rationality"" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.[62]

In New Zealand (Aotearoa), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the Māori as an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Māori demands for self-determination and encourage assimilation.[63]

Far-right sympathisers have been shown to increasingly take part in a multitude of online discursive efforts directed against global brands' multicultural advertisements.[64]: 477 

Racial and ethnic labels can have a significant impact: nonminorities primed to think of themselves as White (versus European American) were subsequently less in favor of multiculturalism and were more racially prejudiced.[65] This was due to decreases in identification with ethnic minorities.[65]

Though not called Multiculturalism as such, the preamble of Argentina's constitution explicitly promotes immigration, and recognizes the individual's multiple citizenship from other countries. Though 97% of Argentina's population self-identify as of European descent and mestizo[66] to this day a high level of multiculturalism remains a feature of Argentina's culture,[67][68] allowing foreign festivals and holidays (e.g. Saint Patrick's Day), supporting all kinds of art or cultural expressions from ethnic groups, as well as their diffusion through an important multicultural presence in the media.
In Argentina there are recognized regional languages Guaraní in Corrientes,[69] Quechua in Santiago del Estero,[70] Qom, Mocoví, and Wichí in Chaco.[71]
According to the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs published on its website, there are 1,779 registered indigenous communities in Argentina, belonging to 39 indigenous peoples.[72][73]

Bolivia is a diverse country made up of 36 different types of indigenous groups.[74] Over 62% of Bolivia's population falls into these different indigenous groups, making it the most indigenous country in Latin America.[75] Out of the indigenous groups the Aymara and the Quechua are the largest.[74] The latter 30% of the population is a part of the mestizo, which are a people mixed with European and indigenous ancestry.[75] Bolivia's political administrations have endorsed multicultural politics and in 2009 Bolivia's Constitution was inscribed with multicultural principles.[76] The Constitution of Bolivia recognizes 36 official languages besides Spanish, each language has its own culture and indigenous group.[77] Bolivian culture is celebrated across the country and has heavy influences from the Aymara, the Quechua, the Spanish, and other popular cultures from around Latin America.

Brazil has been known to acclaim multiculturalism and has undergone many changes regarding this in the past few decades. Brazil is a controversial country when it comes to defining a multicultural country.[78] There are two views: the Harvard Institute of Economic Research points to the fact that Brazil has a large mixed-race population, while researcher Erkan Gören of the University of Oldenburg notes that virtually all Brazilians speaks Portuguese.[78]

Cities such as São Paulo are home to migrants from Japan, Italy, Lebanon and Portugal.[79] There is a multicultural presence in this city, and this is prevalent throughout Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil is a country that has made great strides to embrace migrant cultures. There has been increased awareness of anti-blackness and active efforts to combat racism. However, there is still a lack of school engagement in these matters.[80]

Canadian society is often depicted as being ""very progressive, diverse, and multicultural,"" or a just society that formally acknowledges several different cultures and beliefs.[81][82] Multiculturalism, however, is a misnomer often misidentified as a societal ideal with its associated natural moral sensitivity, whereas it functions as a political instrument for diversity management under official policy.[83][84] Multiculturalism was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government during the premiership of Pierre Elliott Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by factors such as the militant politics of Québécois nationalism, rising Indigenous discontent over the assimilationist policies outlined in the 1969 White Paper, the threat of American cultural annexation, the need to secure ethnic votes in immigrant-rich urban centers, and the appeasement of other European ethnic groups.[85][86]

Multiculturalism is reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act[87] and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[88]  Canadian multiculturalism is often seen as cherishing immigrant ways of life from outside the country, and as such, it is looked upon with admiration resulting in dismissing of most critics of the concept.[89][90] The Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country.[91][92] This conceptual transition of multiculturalism is also reflected in Canada's official discourse, where attitudes about “multiculturalism” have shifted to focus on “diversity,” driven by increasing immigration rates. It now emphasizes Canada's growing multicultural makeup and the variety of ethnic and racial groups within the country.[93] Multiculturalism in Canada is often globally recognized as one of the country's significant accomplishments in diversity management, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian national identity.[84][94]

In a 2002 interview with The Globe and Mail, Karīm al-Hussainī, the 49th Aga Khan of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as ""the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe"", citing it as ""a model for the world"".[95] He explained that the experience of Canadian governance—its commitment to pluralism and its support for the rich multicultural diversity of its people—is something that must be shared and would be of benefit to all societies in other parts of the world.[95] The Economist  ran a cover story in 2016 praising Canada as the most successful multicultural society in the West.[96] The Economist argued that Canada's multiculturalism was a source of strength that united the diverse population and by attracting immigrants from around the world was also an engine of economic growth as well.[96] The influence of the transitioned ideology of multiculturalism in the public sphere has led many public and private groups in Canada to work toward supporting both multiculturalism and recent immigrants to Canada.[97] In an effort to support recent Filipino immigrants to Alberta, for example, one school board partnered with a local university and an immigration agency to support these new families in their school and community.[98]

Mexico has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of Hernán Cortés to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the Aztec Empire and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous religion, politics, culture and ethnicity.[citation needed] The Spanish opened schools in which they taught Christianity, and the Spanish language eventually surpassed indigenous languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.[99]

Mexico City has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside Montreal, on the index).[100] Mexico is an ethnically diverse country with a population composed of approximately 123 million in 2017. There is a wide variety of ethnic groups, the major group being Mestizos followed by White Mexicans and Indigenous Mexicans.[101] There are many other ethnic groups such as Arab Mexicans, Afro-Mexicans and Asian Mexicans.

From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching a total of 961,121 people, mostly coming from Guatemala and the United States.[102] Mexico is quickly becoming a melting pot, with many immigrants coming into the country. It is considered to be a cradle of civilization, which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the mestizaje of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

Peru is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the INEI reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.

Peru is the home to Amerindians but after the Spanish Conquest, the Spanish brought African, and Asian peoples as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 25.8% of the population, Mestizos 60.2%, White 5.9% and 4.8% is composed by Black, Chinese, Japanese and others.[103] In 1821, Peru's president José de San Martín gave foreigners the freedom to start industries in Peru's ground, 2 years after, foreigners that lived in Peru for more than 5 years were considered naturalized citizens, which then decreased to 3 years.

Although official multiculturalism policy is not established at the federal level, ethnic and cultural diversity is common in rural, suburban and urban areas.[104]

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.[105] The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's national myth. The idea of the melting pot is a metaphor that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.[106] The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different from multiculturalism as it is defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration.[107] The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the American founding fathers:

Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.[108]
As a philosophy, multiculturalism began as part of the pragmatism movement at the end of the 19th century in Europe and the United States, then as political and cultural pluralism at the turn of the 20th century.[109] It was partly in response to a new wave of European imperialism in sub-Saharan Africa and the massive immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans to the United States and Latin America. Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, George Santayana, Horace Kallen, John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In Pluralistic Universe (1909), William James espoused the idea of a ""plural society"". James saw pluralism as ""crucial to the formation of philosophical and social humanism to help build a better, more egalitarian society.[110]

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.[111][112] Studies estimated 46 million Americans ages 14 to 24 to be the most diverse generation in American society.[113] In 2009 and 2010, controversy erupted in Texas as the state's curriculum committee made several changes to the state's requirements, often at the expense of minorities. They chose to juxtapose Abraham Lincoln's inaugural address with that of Confederate president Jefferson Davis;[114] they debated removing Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and labor-leader Cesar Chavez[115] and rejected calls to include more Hispanic figures, in spite of the high Hispanic population in the state.[116]

According to a 2000 analysis of domestic terrorism in the United States, ""A distinctive feature of American terrorism is the ideological diversity of perpetrators. White racists are responsible for over a third of the deaths, and black militants have claimed almost as many. Almost all of the remaining deaths are attributable to Puerto Rican nationalists, Islamic extremists, revolutionary leftists and emigre groups.""[117] Twenty years later, far-right and white racists were observed as the leading perpetrators of domestic terrorism in the U.S.[118] According to a 2020 study by the Strategic & International Studies, right-wing extremists are responsible for the murder of 329 people since 1994[119] (over half due to the terrorist bombing of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people).[120]


A 2007 study by Robert Putnam encompassing 30,000 people across the US found that diversity had a negative effect on civic engagement. The greater the diversity, the fewer people voted and the less they volunteered for community projects; also, trust among neighbours was only half that of homogenous communities.[121] Putnam says, however, that ""in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits"", as long as society successfully overcomes the short-term problems.[56] Putnam adds that his ""extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.""[122]
Venezuela is home to a variety of ethnic groups, with an estimated population of 32 million, as of 2018[update].[123] Their population is composed of approximately 68% mestizo, which means of mixed race.[124] Venezuelan culture is mainly composed of a mixture of their indigenous culture, Spanish, and African.[125] There was a heavy influence of Spanish culture due to the Spanish Conquest, which influenced their religion, language and traditions. African influence can be seen in their music.[125] While Spanish is Venezuela's main language, there are more than 40 indigenous languages spoken to this day.[126]

Colombia, with an estimated population of 51 million inhabitants, is populated by a great variety of ethnic groups. Approximately 49% of its population is Mestizo, 37% White, 10% African descent, 3.4% Indigenous and 0.6 Gypsy.

It is estimated that 18.8 million Colombians are direct descendants of Europeans, either by one of their parents or grandparents. Mainly from Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland and England, they represent 37% of its population. The Arab descent also predominates in the country. The Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinians are the largest post-independence immigrants to the country, so much so that Colombia has the second largest Arab diaspora in Latin America, with a little more than 3.2 million descendants, which represents 6.4% of its population.

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.[127]

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of nationalism transformed the way Europeans thought about the state.[127] Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new nation-states were founded on the principle that each nation is entitled to its own sovereignty and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally homogeneous society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.[128]

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.[129] The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory primary education in the national language.[129] The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of cultural assimilation and even ethnic cleansing.[129]

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for ""social cohesion"", ""integration"", and (sometimes) ""assimilation"". The policies include:

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation.[132] The concept of ""Cultural exception"" proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures.[133]

Since its establishment in the seventh century, Bulgaria has hosted many religions, ethnic groups and nations. The capital city Sofia is the only European city that has peacefully functioning, within walking distance of 300 metres,[134][135] four Places of worship of the major religions: Eastern Orthodox (St Nedelya Church), Islam (Banya Bashi Mosque), Roman Catholicism (St. Joseph Cathedral), and Orthodox Judaism (Sofia Synagogue, the third-largest synagogue in Europe).

This unique arrangement has been called by historians a ""multicultural cliche"".[136] It has also become known as ""The Square of Religious Tolerance""[137][138] and has initiated the construction of a 100-square-metre scale model of the site that is to become a symbol of the capital.[139][140][141]

Furthermore, unlike some other Nazi Germany allies or German-occupied countries excluding Denmark, Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to Nazi concentration camps.[142][143] According to Dr Marinova-Christidi, the main reason for the efforts of Bulgarian people to save their Jewish population during WWII is that within the region, they ""co-existed for centuries with other religions"" – giving it a unique multicultural and multiethnic history.[144]

Consequently, within the Balkan region, Bulgaria has become an example for multiculturalism in terms of variety of religions, artistic creativity[145] and ethnicity.[146][147] Its largest ethnic minority groups, Turks and Roma, enjoy wide political representation. In 1984, following a campaign by the Communist regime for a forcible change of the Islamic names of the Turkish minority,[148][149][150][151] an underground organisation called «National Liberation Movement of the Turks in Bulgaria» was formed which headed the Turkish community's opposition movement. On 4 January 1990, the activists of the movement registered an organisation with the legal name Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) (in Bulgarian: Движение за права и свободи: in Turkish: Hak ve Özgürlükler Hareketi) in the Bulgarian city of Varna. At the moment of registration, it had 33 members, at present, according to the organisation's website, 68,000 members plus 24,000 in the organisation's youth wing [1]. In 2012, Bulgarian Turks were represented at every level of government: local, with MRF having mayors in 35 municipalities, at parliamentary level with MRF having 38 deputies (14% of the votes in Parliamentary elections for 2009–13)[152] and at executive level, where there is one Turkish minister, Vezhdi Rashidov. 21 Roma political organisations were founded between 1997–2003 in Bulgaria.[153]

After the end of World War II in  1945, immigration significantly increased. During the period of reconstruction, France lacked the labour to do so, and as a result; the French Government was eager to recruit immigrants coming from all over Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.

Although there was a presence of, Vietnamese in France since the late-nineteenth century (mostly students and workers), a wave of Vietnamese migrated after 1954. These migrants consisted of those who were loyal to the colonial government and those married to French colonists. Following the partition of Vietnam, students and professionals from South Vietnam continued to arrive in France. Although many initially returned to the country after a few years, as the Vietnam War situation worsened, a majority decided to remain in France and brought their families over as well.[154]

This period also saw a significant wave of immigrants from Algeria. As the Algerian War started in 1954, there were already 200,000 Algerian immigrants in France.[155] However, because of the tension between the Algerians and the French, these immigrants were no longer welcome. This conflict between the two sides led to the Paris Massacre of 17 October 1961, when the police used force against an Algerian demonstration on the streets of Paris. After the war, after Algeria gained its independence, the free circulation between France and Algeria was once again allowed, and the number of Algerian immigrants started to increase drastically. From 1962–75, the Algerian immigrant population increased from 350,000 to 700,000.[156] Many of these immigrants were known as the ""harkis"", and the others were known as the ""pieds-noirs"". The ""harkis"" were Algerians who supported the French during the Algerian War; once the war was over, they were deeply resented by other Algerians, and thus had to flee to France. The ""pieds-noirs"" were European settlers who moved to Algeria, but migrated back to France since 1962 when Algeria declared independence.

According to Erik Bleich, multiculturalism in France faced stiff resistance in the educational sector, especially regarding recent Muslim arrivals from Algeria. Gatekeepers often warned that multiculturalism was a threat to the historic basis of French culture.[157]

Jeremy Jennings finds three positions among elites regarding the question of reconciling traditional French Republican principles with multiculturalism. The traditionalists refuse to make any concessions and instead insist on clinging to the historic republican principles of ""laïcité"" and the secular state in which religion and ethnicity are always ignored. In the middle are modernising republicans who uphold republicanism but also accept some elements of cultural pluralism. Finally there are multiculturalist republicans who envision a pluralist conception of French identity and seek an appreciation of the positive values brought to France by the minority cultures.[158]

A major attack on multiculturalism came in Stasi Report of 2003 which denounces ""Islamism"" as deeply opposed to the mainstream interpretations of French culture. It is portrayed as a dangerous political agenda that will create a major obstacle for Muslims to comply with French secularism or ""laïcité "".[159]  Murat Akan, however, argues that the Stasi Report and the new regulations against the hijab and religious symbols in the schools must be set against gestures toward multiculturalism, such as the creation of Muslim schools under contract with the government.[160]

In October 2010, Angela Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam, near Berlin, that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had ""utterly failed"",[161] stating: ""The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work"".[161][162] She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany[163] on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which middle eastern immigrants have integrated into German society.[164] In 2015, Merkel again criticized multiculturalism on the grounds that it leads to parallel societies.[165]

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Germany is the first Muslim group to have been granted ""corporation under public law status"", putting the community on par with the major Christian churches and Jewish communities of Germany.[166]

Luxembourg has one of the highest foreign-born populations in Europe, foreigners account for nearly half of the country's total population.[167] The majority of foreigners are from: Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal.[168] In total, 170 different nationalities make up the population of Luxembourg, out of this; 86% are of European descent.[169] The official languages of Luxembourg are German, French, and Luxembourgish all of which are supported in the Luxembourg government and education system.[169][170] In 2005, Luxembourg officially promoted and implemented the objectives of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. This Convention affirms multicultural policies in Luxembourg and creates political awareness of cultural diversity.[171]

Multiculturalism in the Netherlands began with major increases in immigration to the Netherlands during the mid-1950s and 1960s.[172] As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early-1980s.[172] Different groups could themselves determine religious and cultural matters, while state authorities would handle matters of housing and work policy.[173]

In the 1990s, the public debate were generally optimistic on immigration and the prevailing view was that a multicultural policy would reduce the social economic disparities over time.[173]

This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s and post-electoral surveys uniformly showed from 1994 onwards that a majority preferred that immigrants assimilated rather than retained the culture of their country of origin.[172][174]

Following the September 11 attacks in the United States and the murders of Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) and Theo van Gogh (in 2004), there was increased political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands.[173][175]

Lord Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, made a distinction between tolerance and multiculturalism, citing the Netherlands as a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society.[176] In June 2011, the First Rutte cabinet said the Netherlands would turn away from multiculturalism: ""Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant"" Minister Donner said.[177]

Since Antiquity, Romania has hosted many religious and ethnic groups, besides Romanians, including Roma people, Hungarians, Germans, Turks, Greeks, Tatars, Slovaks, Serbs, Jews and others. During WW2 and Communism, most of these ethnic groups chose to emigrate to other countries. However, since the 1990s, Romania has received a growing number of immigrants and refugees, most of them from the Arab world, Asia or Africa. Immigration is expected to increase in the future, as large numbers of Romanian workers leave the country and are being replaced by foreigners.[178][179]

Multiculturalism in Scandinavia has centered on discussions about marriage, dress, religious schools, Muslim funeral rites and gender equality. Forced marriages have been widely debated in Denmark, Sweden and Norway but the countries differ in policy and responses by authorities.[182]

Sweden has the most permissive policies while Denmark the most restrictive ones.

In 2001, Denmark, a liberal-conservative coalition government with the support of the Danish People's Party which instituted less pluralistic policy, geared more towards assimilation.[182]

A 2018 study found that increases in local ethnic diversity in Denmark caused ""rightward shifts in election outcomes by shifting electoral support away from traditional ""big government"" left‐wing parties and towards anti‐immigrant nationalist parties.""[183]

For decades, Danish immigration policy was built upon the belief that, with support, immigrants and their descendants would eventually reach the same levels of education as Danes. In a 2019 report, the Danish Immigration Service and the Ministry of Education found this to be false. The report found that, while the second-generation immigrants without a Western background do better than their parents, the same is not true for third-generation immigrants. One of the reasons given was that second-generation immigrants may marry someone from their country of origin, which may cause Danish not to be spoken at home, which would put the children at a disadvantage in school. Thereby, the process of integrating has to start from the beginning for each generation.[184][185]

Apart from citizens of Nordic countries, all foreigners must apply for permanent residency in order to live and work in Norway.[187] In 2017, the Norwegian immigrant population was made up of: citizens of EU and EEA countries (41.2%); citizens of Asian countries, including Turkey (32.4%); citizens of African countries (13.7%); and citizens of non-EU/EEA European, North American, South American and Oceanian countries (12.7%).[188]

In 2015, during the European migrant crisis, a total of 31,145 asylum seekers, most of whom came from Afghanistan and Syria, crossed the Norwegian border.[189] In 2016, the number of asylum seekers dramatically reduced by almost 90%, with 3460 asylum seekers coming to Norway. This was partly due to the stricter border control across Europe, including an agreement between the EU and Turkey.[190][191]

As of September 2019, 15 foreign residents who had travelled from Norway to Syria or Iraq to join the Islamic State have had their residence permits revoked.[192]

The Progress Party has named the reduction of high levels of immigration from non-European countries one of their goals:

An extreme form of opposition to immigration in Norway were the 22/7 attacks carried out by the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July 2011. He killed 8 people by bombing government buildings in Oslo and massacred 69 young people at a youth summer camp held by the Labour Party, who were in power at the time. He blamed the party for the high level of Muslim immigration and accused it of ""promoting multiculturalism"".[194]

Sweden has from the early 1970s experienced a greater share of non-Western immigration than the other Scandinavian countries, which consequently have placed multiculturalism on the political agenda for a longer period of time.[182]

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. On 14 May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the social democratic government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation.[196] The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the Sweden Democrats, multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.[197]

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.[198]

A 2014 study published by Gävle University College showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.[199] The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with Christianity as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.[195]

A 2017 study by Lund University also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration.[200] The erosive effect on trust was more pronounced for immigration from culturally distant countries.[201]

In Serbia, there are 19 officially recognised ethnic groups with a status of national minorities.[202] Vojvodina is an autonomous province of Serbia, located in the northern part of the country. It has a multiethnic and multicultural identity;[203] there are more than 26 ethnic groups in the province,[204][205] which has six official languages.[206] Largest ethnic groups in Vojvodina are Serbs (67%), Hungarians (13%), Slovaks, Croats, Romani, Romanians, Montenegrins, Bunjevci, Bosniaks, Rusyns. The Chinese[207][208] and Arabs, are the only two significant immigrant minorities in Serbia.

Radio Television of Vojvodina broadcasts program in ten local languages. The project by the Government of AP Vojvodina titled ""Promotion of Multiculturalism and Tolerance in Vojvodina"", whose primary goal is to foster the cultural diversity and develop the atmosphere of interethnic tolerance among the citizens of Vojvodina, has been successfully implemented since 2005.[209] Serbia is continually working on improving its relationship and inclusion of minorities in its effort to gain full accession to the European Union. Serbia has initiated talks through Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 7 November 2007.

Multicultural policies[210] were adopted by local administrations from the 1970s and 1980s onwards. In 1997, the newly elected Labour government committed to a multiculturalist approach at a national level,[211] but after 2001, there was something of a backlash, led by centre-left commentators such as David Goodhart and Trevor Phillips. The Government then embraced a policy of community cohesion instead. In 2011, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that ""state multiculturalism has failed"".[212] Critics argue that analyses which view society as 'too diverse' for social democracy and cohesion have ""performative"" effects regarding legitimate racism towards those classed as immigrants.[213][214] Others, however, like author Ed West, criticize the notion that the United Kingdom is or should be a multicultural society in the first place and that the project of diversity is misguided.[215]

The idea of multiculturalism in Russia is closely linked to the territory and the Soviet concept of ""nationality"". The Federation is divided into a series of republics where each ethnic group has preponderance in deciding the laws that affect that republic. A distinction is then made between Rossiyane (Russian citizens) and Russkie (ethnic Russians).

Each people within their territories has the right to practice their customs and traditions and even to impose their own laws, as is the case in Chechnya, as long as they do not violate federal and constitutional laws of the Russian Federation.

According to the 1961 Census of India, there are 1652 indigenous languages in the country.[216] The culture of India has been shaped by its long history, unique geography and diverse demography. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture and customs differ from place to place within the country, but nevertheless possess a commonality. The culture of India is an amalgamation of these diverse sub-cultures spread all over the Indian subcontinent and traditions that are several millennia old.[217] The previously prevalent Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed jātis or castes.[218]

Religiously, Hindus form the majority, followed by Muslims. The statistics are: Hindu (79.8%), Muslim (14.2%), Christian (2.3%), Sikh (1.7%), Buddhist (0.7%), Jain (0.4%), Unaffiliated (0.23%), Baháʼís, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others (0.65%).[219] Linguistically, the two main language families in India are Indo-Aryan (a branch of Indo-European) and Dravidian. In India's northeast, people speaking Sino-Tibetan group of languages such as Meitei (Meitei-lon) and Bodo recognized by the Indian constitution and Austroasiatic languages are commonly found. India (officially) follows a three-language policy. Hindi (spoken in the form of Hindustani) is the official federal language, English has the federal status of associate/subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language (in the Hindi sprachraum, this reduces to bilingualism). Further, India does not have any national language.[220][221] The Republic of India's state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups; this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno-linguistic sub-cultures, except for the Hindi sprachraum which is itself divided into many states. Thus, most states differ from one another in language, culture, cuisine, clothing, literary style, architecture, music and festivities.

India has encountered religiously motivated violence,[222] such as the Moplah Riots, the Bombay riots, the 1984 Sikh genocide, the 1990 Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, the 2002 Gujarat riots, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the 2012 Assam violence, the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, and the 2020 Delhi riots. This has resulted from traditionally disadvantaged communities in public employment such as the policing of the same locality, apprehension of owners in giving properties for sale or rent[223] and of society in accepting inter-marriages.[224]

The Indian constitution requires the various state-run institutions to provide quotas for minorities, which give these cultural minorities equal opportunities, as well as a forum through which they can actively participate in the institutions of the dominant culture.[225] Indian polity after the 1990s has been marked by a shift from secular principles to a landscape that is dominated by pro-Hindu propaganda; the Bhartiya Janata Party has used this rhetoric by reconstructing Hinduism and bartering it under the guise of Indian nationalism.[226] However, the rise of pro-Hindu ideology, commonly known as Hindutva, has impinged on the rights of cultural minorities.[227] This can be seen in the large scale violence against cultural minorities, the votebank politics used by the Indian National Congress, and the promotion of issues faced by the larger religious communities over those faced by the backward groups in religious minorities.[228]

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are constitutionally recognized terms in India and constitute approximately 25% of the Indian population. Moreover more than 40 percent of India's population belongs to the Other Backward Castes as per the National Sample Survey Office or the NSSO which is a government organization for conducting surveys in India. So the total size of the lower castes in India is estimated to be around 70 percent of the country's population whereas the upper caste make up around 18 percent of the population. These groups have been provided with reservations that constitutionally guarantee them representation in governmental institutions, a mandate suggested by the Mandal Commission.[229] The Indian constitution also provides SC's and ST's with protective measures that ensure equality, which is the main issue faced by members of both communities. However, while scheduled castes have turned into important political communities that the state concerns itself about, scheduled tribes continue to be politically marginalized.[225]

Pluralism, diversity and multiculturalism is a daily fact of life in Indonesia. There are over 600 ethnic groups in Indonesia.[230][231] 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.[232] The Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia who make up nearly 42% of the total population.[233] The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country.[233] There are also more than 700 living languages spoken in Indonesia[234] and although predominantly Muslim the country also has large Christian and Hindu populations.

Indonesia's national motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (""Unity in Diversity"" lit. ""many, yet one"") enshrined in Pancasila the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country.[235] The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of Javanization, although Minangkabau, Malay, Madurese, Bugis and Makassar people, as a result of their merantau (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while Chinese Indonesians can be found in most urban areas. Because of urbanization, major Indonesian cities such as Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Palembang, Medan and Makassar have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the fall of Suharto in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native Dayak tribes against Madurese transmigrants in Kalimantan during Sambas riots in 1999[236] and the Sampit conflict in 2001.[237] There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as violence erupted in Poso between 1998 and into 2000,[238] and violences in Maluku between 1999 and into 2002.[239] Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

Chinese Indonesians are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered discrimination.[240] The Suharto Orde Baru or New Order adopted a forced assimilation policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.[241] Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt Indonesian-sounding names, and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned.[240] The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during riots in 1998. As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, Abdurrahman Wahid came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President Megawati Sukarnoputri declared that the Chinese New Year (Imlek) would be marked as a national holiday from 2003.[242] Tense incidents however have included attacks on Chinese temples[243] and Indonesian politician Basuki Tjahaja Purnama being given a two year prison sentence for blasphemy due to comments he made to his supporters in September 2016.[244][245]

There are sizeable populations of ethnic Kazakhs, Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Uighurs, Tatars, Germans and more in Kazakhstan.[246][unreliable source?] Kazakhstan was one of a few countries in post-Soviet territories that avoided interethnic clashes and conflicts in the period of USSR's final crisis and its eventual breakup.[247] In 1995, Kazakhstan created the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan, an advisory body designed to represent the country's ethnic minorities.[248] However, recent ethnic clashes and discrimination have been reported for groups such as Christians,[249][250] ultraconservative Muslims,[251] ethnic Dungans,[252][253] Chechens, Tajiks,[254] and LGBT people.[255][256]

Malaysia is a multiethnic country, with Malays making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are Malaysians of Chinese descent. Malaysians of Indian descent comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:

The Malaysian New Economic Policy or NEP serves as a form of ""racial equalization"" in the view of the Malay-controlled government.[257] It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the 13 May racial riots of 1969, it sought to address the ""significant imbalance"" in the economic sphere where the minority especially the  Chinese population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country. Critics of this policy has called it synonymous to racial discrimination and synonymous to Apartheid.

The Malay Peninsula has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly Malays before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then British Malaya such as Penang, Malacca and Singapore became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of institutionalized discrimination.[258][259]

Preceding independence of the Federation of Malaya, a social contract was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the 1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the Bumiputra policy.

These pluralist policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial status of religious freedom in Malaysia.

Due to historical immigration trends, Singapore has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of Malays and Indians (predominantly Tamils). Other prominent smaller groups include Peranakans, Arabs, Armenians, Eurasians, Europeans, Americans, and Canadians. Besides English, Singapore recognizes three other languages—Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Tamil. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages (""mother tongues""). Besides being a multilingual country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

Under the Raffles Plan of Singapore, the city was divided into ethnic enclaves such as Geylang, Chinatown, and Little India. Housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.[260] A similar policy exists in politics as all Group Representation Constituencies are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority.[261]

Today, such ethnic enclaves has mostly been eliminated, due to the contemporary Singapore's government policy to encourage further ethnic integration between the different races of Singapore. A prominent example is its public housing system. Unlike other countries, public housing is not ostracised by a wide majority of the population and its government, and acts as a necessary and vital measure to provide immaculate and safe housing surrounded by public amenities at affordable prices, especially during its rapid development and industrialisation in the early years of independence.[262] It is also meant to foster social cohesion between the social classes and races of Singapore, and prevent neglected areas or districts and ethnic enclaves from developing – known as the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP).[263] As such, it is considered a unique part of Singaporean culture, being commonly associated with the country.[264]

South Korea remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.[265] Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.[266] This can be seen as a result of World War II where the first noteworthy wave of multiculturalism between American servicemen and Korean women occurred. South Korea has been long regarded as an ethnic homogeneous country, therefore, the rise in mixed-race children was seen as a new phenomenon. Before the 1990s, the term honhyeol was commonly used to identify multiracial individuals in Korea – primarily in relation to the children of Korean women and American servicemen;[267] this common term strengthened the association of multiracial people with a sense of alienation, rather than promoting cultural diversity within Korea. Not only did this term effectively discriminate against mixed-race Koreans but it also made a clear distinction between native Koreans and mixed-race Koreans.

Han Geon-Soo 2007 notes the increased use of the word ""multiculturalism"" in South Korea: ""As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement."" He argued, however, that ""the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea"" lacked ""the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society"".[268]

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:

The Korea Times suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.[270] In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the JoongAng Ilbo stated: ""Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures."" He further opined:

In 2010, results from the Korean Identity Survey suggested that government programs promoting multiculturalism had seen some success with over 60% of Koreans supporting the idea a multicultural society.[272] However, the same poll in 2015 showed that support of a multicultural society had dropped to 49.7% suggesting a possible return to ethnic exclusivism.[273]

Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia. It is home to several ethnic groups including Turkish, Arab, Armenian, Assyrian, Greek, Kurdish, and Jewish. There are cultural influences dating back to ancient Hellenic, Semitic and Iranian civilizations which diffused and mingled in myriad ways over a period of centuries.[274]

In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the Ottoman past.[275]

Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, Cameroon is found in central Africa consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, many people commonly label Cameroon as ""Africa in Miniature"".[276][277]

Before Cameroon's independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916–1961.[277] Upon gaining sovereignty, a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents.[278][279] Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and Pidgin known as Frananglais gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.[280]

Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 indigenous languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well.[281] Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from Bantu, Sudanic, Baka, Wodaabe (or Mbororo) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as Pygmies.[282][283]

Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from exploiting or violating them.[284]: 2  In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in ""local, regional, and national levels"" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.[285]

Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of Mauritius.[286] This is mainly because of colonization that has been present from, the English, the French, and the Dutch.[287] However, the Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and Indo-Mauritians, Mauritian Creoles (of African and Malagasy descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic Sino-Mauritians and Franco-Mauritians (descendants of the original French colonists).[288] Mauritius has embraced intertwining of cultures from the origin of the country, and has coined the term fruit-salad, which is a much more appealing term in comparison to melting-pot showing that they were not forced to these cultures.[289]

South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa.[290] South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages.[291] The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa's cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised due to its development, it is still known for its diverse culture.

The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the Special Broadcasting Service.[292] The Australian Government retains multiculturalism in policy and as a defining aspect of Australia today.[19][20][22][21]

The White Australia Policy was dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy, although the official policy of multiculturalism was not formally introduced until 1972.[293] The election of John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition government in 1996 was a major watershed for Australian multiculturalism. Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism, releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s.[294] A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services, first published in 1999, was a publication of the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public.[295][296][297] The first edition covered Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh faiths, with participation of representatives of the various religions.[298] The second edition, published in 2002, added Christian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander religions and the Baháʼí Faith to the list of religions.[299]

Contact between people of different cultures in Australia has been characterised by tolerance and engagement, but have also occasionally resulted in conflict and rifts.[300][301] Australia's diverse migrant communities have brought with them food, lifestyle and cultural practices, many of which have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture.[19][20]

Members of a multicultural community who are not of English-speaking Anglo-Australian, Anglo-Saxon or ‘Anglo-Celtic’ Australian background or not ""assimilated"" are often referred to in policy discourse as culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD), introduced in 1996 to replace non-English speaking background (NESB).[302][303][304]

New Zealand is a sovereign Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's White Australia Policy and the United States Immigration Act of 1924,[305] but it would later follow suit with Australia and Canada in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s.[306][307] This led to an increase of Asian and Pacific islander peoples on the island, and ultimately a more diverse European population.[308] In 1985, the Law Commission Act was passed which required the New Zealand Law Commission to review laws while taking into account both the indigenous Māori of New Zealand and New Zealand's multicultural character.[309] In 1987, New Zealand officially recognized the indigenous Māori language as a national language.[310] The revitalization in the Māori language led to its immersion in schools and television broadcast.[311]

In 2001, the New Zealand government opened an Office of Ethnic Affairs to advise its local governments on the advancement of ethnic diversity and affairs of its multicultural communities.[309] Many landmarks on the island have both their Māori and English names officially recognized. Māori makes up 3.7% of the population's speaking language.[312] A 2013 census of New Zealand's population showed that 74% of the population identifies ethnically as European, while the latter 15% majority identify as Māori. The remainder identify as Asian, Arab, African, Pacific Islander and Latin American.

Papua New Guinea has one of the most heterogeneous indigenous populations in the world: there are several thousand separate communities, most with only a few hundred people.[313]: 205  This Oceanian country is home to over eight million people[314] that are divided into hundreds of different indigenous ethnic groups and cultures with over 820 different indigenous languages.[315] A majority of the indigenous groups are Papuans who have ancestors that lived in New Guinea over ten thousand years ago. The latter majority are Austronesians whose ancestors arrived less than four thousand years ago. The island's population is also made up of many expatriate citizens from China, Australia, Indonesia, Europe and the Philippines. In 1975, the island population was found to be made up of 40,000 of these diverse expatriate citizens.[316] Despite the large amount of culturally diverse locations on the island, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site is the only UNESCO World heritage location.[317]

It was noted that multiculturalism can be observed in both small communities and large national scales, often resulting from immigration or historical amalgamation of different cultural areas. The political philosophy of multiculturalism involves ideologies and policies aimed at managing cultural plurality within sovereign borders, contrasting with the 'melting pot' approach. Historical examples such as the Achaemenid Empire and Habsburg monarchy were discussed, highlighting both positive integration and controversial events. Modern political debates center around whether multiculturalism effectively addresses diversity and immigrant integration, with varying policies across Western nations since the 1970s. Canada was highlighted as a pioneer in adopting multicultural policies, influencing other countries like Australia and several European Union member states. However, recent shifts towards monoculturalism in some European countries were noted due to concerns over segregation and terrorism. The discussion also covered the impact of multiculturalism on social cohesion, economic interests, political power, and education. Research findings on ethnic diversity's effects on public goods provision and social trust were presented, showing mixed results but emphasizing that factors like economic inequality play a significant role in social cohesion. Critics argue about the sustainability and desirability of multicultural ideals, while supporters view it as promoting tolerance and equality.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the stage for the forum\n- Brief greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Quick recap of multiculturalism concept"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Multiculturalism\nTLDR: Discuss historical examples and their relevance today\n- Historian shares insights on Achaemenid Empire and Habsburg monarchy\n- Discussion on positive integration vs. controversial events\n- Participants share thoughts on historical lessons"", ""Scene 3: Modern Political Debates on Multiculturalism\nTLDR: Explore current political perspectives and policies\n- Political Scientist discusses varying policies in Western nations since the 1970s\n- Debate on effectiveness of multiculturalism in addressing diversity and immigrant integration\n- Participants share views on recent shifts towards monoculturalism"", ""Scene 4: Impact on Social Cohesion and Economic Interests\nTLDR: Analyze how multiculturalism affects social cohesion and economy\n- Sociologist presents research findings on ethnic diversity\u2019s effects on public goods provision and social trust\n- Discussion on economic inequality\u2019s role in social cohesion\n- Participants share personal experiences related to these impacts"", ""Scene 5: Education and Cultural Integration Strategies\nTLDR: Examine educational approaches to fostering cultural integration\n- Cultural Anthropologist discusses ethnographic insights into education systems promoting multicultural values\n- Immigration Policy Expert shares successful policy examples from Canada, Australia, EU member states \n - Community Leader provides grassroots perspective on community-based educational initiatives"", ""Scene 6: Open Forum for Innovative Ideas \n TLDR : Encourage spontaneous contributions for new opportunities \n - Participants brainstorm innovative ideas to enhance culture of innovation \n - Share personal anecdotes relevant to discussion points \n - Allow natural evolution of topics based on participant interests"", ""Scene 7 : Addressing Criticisms of Multicultural Ideals \n TLDR : Discuss sustainability & desirability of multicultural ideals \n - Critics\u2019 arguments about challenges & potential drawbacks \n - Supporters\u2019 views promoting tolerance & equality \n - Participants engage in respectful debate & resolution"", ""Scene 8 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarize key takeaways & outline future actions \\ n - Recap generated innovative ideas & identified opportunities \\ n - Discuss steps to foster enhanced culture of innovation moving forward\\ n - Thank participants for their contributions""]",">>Sociologist: Good morning, everyone. Let's dive into the cultural dynamics of multiculturalism and its impact on our societies.

>>Political Scientist: Morning! Building on that, from a political standpoint, it's not just about different cultures coexisting but also about how they interact within a political framework.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Hi all! It's important to explore how different cultures shape and influence each other from an anthropological perspective.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: Absolutely. I'm looking forward to discussing how immigration policies shape our multicultural societies and the legal frameworks that promote inclusivity and integration.

>>Historian: Speaking of frameworks, historically speaking, multiculturalism has deep roots in ancient civilizations. For instance, the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great was known for incorporating various cultures within its territories. This historical context can offer insights into managing cultural integration today.

>>Community Leader: That's a great point. From a community perspective, we need to focus on creating inclusive spaces where every voice is heard and grassroots efforts can foster cultural integration and social cohesion. 
 >>Historian: You know, looking back at the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, it's clear they did a fantastic job of integrating different cultures. Cyrus had this knack for respecting and incorporating various traditions, which really helped unify his empire. On the flip side, the Habsburg monarchy often struggled with this, leading to conflicts like the mass murder of Székelys in 1764. It shows that while multiculturalism can be great, it needs careful handling.

>>Sociologist: That's a good point. The way Cyrus embraced cultural differences is quite different from how the Habsburgs handled things. They tried to force assimilation rather than celebrating diversity, which caused a lot of tension. We can learn from this that successful multicultural integration means genuinely valuing and including different cultures.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! The Achaemenid Empire didn't just tolerate other cultures; they actively included them in their governance. This respect and integration are key lessons for us today. How do you think we can apply these ideas now?

>>Political Scientist: Well, from a political standpoint, it's all about how policies are crafted and implemented. The Achaemenid Empire's success came from inclusive governance that respected cultural differences. In contrast, the Habsburgs' failure was due to their inability to harmoniously integrate diverse groups.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: Right, and when we look at immigration policies today, it's crucial that our legal frameworks don't just tolerate but actively embrace cultural diversity. This approach helps weave these differences into the fabric of society.

>>Community Leader: Exactly! In our community, we've seen how grassroots efforts like multicultural festivals and inclusive dialogue spaces can bridge cultural divides and foster understanding among diverse groups.

>>Sociologist: Yes! Historical examples like the Achaemenid Empire show us that genuine respect for diverse cultures leads to harmony. Meanwhile, neglecting these differences—as seen with the Habsburgs—can lead to conflict. So how do we ensure our current policies reflect these lessons?

>>Political Scientist: To add on that—the Achaemenid Empire's policies were about active inclusion rather than mere tolerance. They allowed different cultures to maintain their traditions while contributing to governance—a stark contrast to forced assimilation attempts by others.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Definitely! Culture evolves over time through genuine respect and inclusion—not just through policy but also through everyday interactions.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: And putting it into today's context—our immigration laws should aim not only to manage but also celebrate cultural diversity much like what was done during Cyrus' reign.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! Grassroots initiatives play a vital role in fostering multicultural integration within communities by organizing events like festivals or creating inclusive spaces for dialogue which build bridges among diverse groups. 
 >>Political Scientist: We need to look at how multicultural policies are put into practice and their impact on governance. Are these policies really helping people integrate, or are they creating separate communities? What does this mean for our society?

>>Sociologist: Right, we should think about the cultural dynamics here. Multicultural policies can either bring people together or push them apart, depending on how they're implemented. The key question is whether these policies encourage real cultural exchange or just coexistence without interaction.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Exactly. On the ground, these policies can lead to vibrant cultural exchanges in some places but isolated enclaves in others. For example, in Toronto, multiculturalism has led to a rich mix of cultures interacting daily. But in some European cities, it has resulted in communities that rarely interact with each other. What can we learn from these different outcomes?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: From an immigration policy standpoint, the legal framework is crucial. Well-crafted laws can promote integration by encouraging cultural exchange, but if they don't address the needs of diverse communities, they can lead to segregation. Take Canada's Multiculturalism Act—it promotes cultural exchange but needs proper enforcement to be effective.

>>Community Leader: It's not just about laws and frameworks; it's about people's daily lives. How do we make sure that multiculturalism leads to genuine integration rather than just coexistence?

>>Political Scientist: Some Western nations are shifting towards monoculturalism due to concerns over national identity and security. This shift raises questions about our commitment to diversity and inclusion.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Culture evolves and adapts over time. Multicultural policies can create a rich tapestry of cultural exchange or lead to isolated communities if not managed well. How does this shape our understanding of integration?

>>Historian: Looking back at ancient civilizations like the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, we see examples of managing diversity successfully. These historical models can offer insights into fostering genuine integration today.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: It's important that laws promoting multiculturalism are effectively implemented and enforced. For instance, Canada's Multiculturalism Act aims for cultural exchange but needs proper enforcement to avoid becoming just symbolic.

>>Sociologist: Absolutely! The dynamics within multicultural policies are complex. We need to consider how these policies can bridge gaps between communities rather than widen them.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Shifts towards monoculturalism often come from perceived threats to national identity, which reduces cultural exchange and mutual understanding.

>>Community Leader: I agree with all of you—at the grassroots level, it's essential that people feel included and valued in their everyday lives. 
 >>Sociologist: Um, research shows that economic inequality plays a significant role in social cohesion. When people perceive economic disparities, it often leads to reduced trust and cooperation within communities.

>>Political Scientist: True, but it's not just about economic inequality. It's also how it intersects with cultural diversity. We need policies that address both to foster genuine social cohesion. What does this mean for our society?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Right, and when communities embrace their diverse cultural heritage while addressing economic disparities, social cohesion can actually be strengthened. For example, look at how some cities have used cultural festivals to bring people together. What can we learn from these initiatives?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: From an immigration policy perspective, the legal framework is crucial in shaping how multiculturalism impacts social cohesion and economic interests. Well-crafted laws can ensure that diverse communities have equal access to resources and opportunities, which helps mitigate economic disparities and fosters trust within society.

>>Sociologist: Exactly! Economic inequality exacerbates the challenges posed by cultural diversity. When communities face significant economic disparities, it often leads to a breakdown in social trust and cooperation. Addressing both dimensions is essential for fostering true social cohesion.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, culture can act as a bridge when communities actively engage with each other's practices and traditions. This fosters mutual respect and understanding. For instance, community centers that host cultural exchange programs have seen great success in building unity.

>>Community Leader: In our community, we've seen firsthand how economic inequality strains social cohesion. But creating spaces where people from different backgrounds can come together and share their stories builds trust and understanding. How do we replicate these grassroots efforts on a larger scale? Maybe through more funding for local initiatives or partnerships with larger organizations?

>>Political Scientist: From a political standpoint, it's crucial to recognize that policies addressing economic inequality must be designed with cultural sensitivity in mind. When we craft policies considering both dimensions, we create a more cohesive society. How do we ensure our policies are inclusive enough to address these intersecting issues?

>>Historian: Historically speaking, after World War II, many European countries implemented policies promoting both economic equity and cultural integration which led to cohesive societies despite their diversity. What lessons can we draw from these historical precedents?

>>Sociologist: Indeed! We need to consider how cultural dynamics act as catalysts for social cohesion. Shared cultural activities foster belonging and mutual respect which mitigates the negative impacts of economic inequality.

>>Political Scientist: To illustrate my point further—consider Canada's approach to multiculturalism; it's been quite effective despite their own set of challenges with economic disparities. How might we adapt such inclusive policies here?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! Look at Toronto's Caribana festival—it brings together diverse groups through celebration of Caribbean culture while boosting local economy too!

>>Community Leader: Exactly! Creating spaces where diverse backgrounds converge builds trust organically—how do we scale up these grassroots initiatives effectively? Maybe by creating mentorship programs or securing grants for community projects? 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: Storytelling is a powerful tool for cultural integration. How can we bring more of these stories into our schools?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: Canada and Australia have done a great job with this. What can we learn from them to apply here?

>>Political Scientist: We need to make sure these policies are practical. How do we handle pushback from those who might see this as too disruptive?

>>Sociologist: Um, what about the role of cultural dynamics in shaping perceptions?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Good point! And how do we integrate that into the curriculum?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: To put it in context, legal frameworks in Canada and Australia have been instrumental in embedding multicultural education into national policies. These frameworks ensure that cultural narratives are integrated in a way that respects diversity.

>>Community Leader: Local storytelling initiatives are key. We should support these efforts to make them sustainable.

>>Sociologist: Indeed! The crux of the matter is how we can ensure that these cultural narratives are not just included but actively engaged with by students.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Exactly! One compelling example I've seen is in New Zealand, where schools have integrated Maori cultural practices into their curriculum. This preserves indigenous heritage and fosters pride among students.

>>Historian: Historically, many societies have successfully integrated diverse cultures into education systems. For instance, New Zealand's inclusion of Maori practices is a great model.

>>Sociologist: What we need to consider is how these cultural narratives can be integrated into the curriculum in a way that actively engages students—creating interactive learning experiences that allow them to share their own stories.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Interestingly enough, incorporating ethnographic studies into the curriculum allows students to learn about different cultures through firsthand accounts and immersive experiences. I recently visited a school where they had community storytelling sessions—it was amazing to see students so engaged. 
 >>Community Leader: Those storytelling sessions are a great way to help different groups understand each other better. How can we get more voices from various cultural backgrounds involved?

>>Sociologist: We should think about how cultural differences can spark new ideas. For example, if we create spaces where people from different cultures work together on projects, we might see some really unique solutions.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! And what if we integrate traditional crafts into modern innovation hubs? Imagine artisans and tech innovators collaborating. Culture can really inspire fresh ways of thinking.

>>Political Scientist: But how do we make sure these initiatives lead to real policy changes and aren't just for show? We need to look at their impact on governance and societal cohesion. What does this mean for our society?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: From an immigration policy angle, it's important that our laws support these multicultural efforts. How can we create policies that not only protect cultural diversity but also encourage active participation and integration?

>>Sociologist: Also, let's consider the role of cultural festivals. They could be platforms for showcasing diverse talents and ideas, fostering cross-cultural collaboration and creativity.

>>Political Scientist: Right, but we need policies that ensure these initiatives are sustainable. It's not just about creating spaces for exchange; it's about embedding these practices into our governance structures. How do we achieve long-term impact?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: From an anthropological view, digital storytelling platforms could be powerful too. Imagine a virtual space where people share their stories and traditions!

>>Historian: Historically speaking, ancient civilizations like the Achaemenid Empire actively integrated diverse cultures into their governance. What lessons can we learn from them to make sure our modern initiatives are meaningful?

>>Sociologist: Good point! And educational institutions could play a big role through cultural exchange programs that promote mutual understanding among students.

>>Community Leader: Exactly! Local community centers already have trust within communities, making them perfect places for these activities.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: That's true! Community centers could implement these ideas at the grassroots level while aligning with broader legal frameworks.

>>Political Scientist: So how do we ensure policies reflect this integration? We need concrete steps to embed multicultural practices into everyday governance.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Yes! And let's use social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok to share short stories or snippets from various cultures.

>>Historian: Looking back again, many successful integrations happened in shared public spaces like markets or town squares where people naturally interacted daily.

>>Sociologist: Maybe modern equivalents like co-working spaces or public libraries could serve similar purposes today. 
 >>Political Scientist: You see, while co-working spaces and public libraries do offer opportunities for cultural exchange, the real issue is whether our policies are fostering genuine integration or just creating isolated enclaves. So, what does this mean for us?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's a good point. One of the key challenges we face is ensuring that multicultural policies don't inadvertently create isolated enclaves. For instance, in cities like Toronto, events like Caribana not only celebrate Caribbean culture but also invite participation from diverse communities. This helps us understand how to create inclusive spaces.

>>Sociologist: Yeah, I agree with you both. We need to think about how these policies can sometimes lead to isolation instead of integration. But let's talk about solutions—how do we make sure these policies promote true cultural exchange?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: From an immigration policy perspective, it's essential to ensure our legal frameworks actively promote integration rather than segregation. Policies should encourage mixed housing and community programs that bring different cultural groups together. This aligns with our broader goals of fostering inclusive spaces.

>>Sociologist: Exactly! And balancing cultural preservation with integration is crucial too. We need policies that encourage interaction and mutual respect among different cultural groups. How can we make sure these policies are effective?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! The beauty of culture is that it evolves through interaction. In my ethnographic studies, I've seen how shared community spaces like markets and festivals can foster genuine integration. For example, I once observed a market where vendors from different backgrounds collaborated on events—it really brought people together.

>>Community Leader: From a community perspective, grassroots initiatives play a significant role in fostering genuine integration. Local festivals and community centers often serve as melting pots where different cultures interact and learn from each other. How can we leverage these grassroots efforts more effectively?

>>Historian: Well, looking at historical contexts where multiculturalism has been both successful and challenging can be insightful too. Ancient civilizations often thrived on diversity but faced tensions as well. We should apply those lessons today to avoid pitfalls while promoting inclusivity.

>>Political Scientist: Consider this—while multicultural policies aim to foster inclusivity, they often face the challenge of balancing cultural preservation with integration. The fundamental issue is whether these policies are creating genuine interaction or merely superficial coexistence.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Right! And sometimes multicultural policies lead to unintended consequences. For example, in my studies, I've seen festivals that promote interaction but also highlight cultural differences which can cause tension if not managed properly.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: So true! From an immigration policy perspective, it's crucial to address potential drawbacks by designing policies that prevent isolated enclaves through mixed housing and community programs encouraging interaction among different groups.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! Grassroots initiatives are vital for genuine integration—local festivals and community centers thrive by celebrating diversity and creating personal connections. 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, we should think about creating more places where different cultural groups can hang out together—like community gardens or art projects. These spaces can really help people connect on a regular basis.

>>Sociologist: Right. We've identified several key opportunities to foster a culture of innovation through cultural integration. For instance, community gardens and art projects are great ideas. But we also need to think about how these initiatives can be supported by inclusive policies.

>>Political Scientist: From a political standpoint, it's crucial that we not only create these shared spaces but also ensure they are backed by robust policies. How do you all think we can leverage existing legal frameworks to promote inclusivity?

>>Immigration Policy Expert: That's a great question! We could start by advocating for policies that protect the rights of all cultural groups involved. It's important to understand how these laws can be practically implemented to foster genuine integration.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! Local festivals and shared spaces really help bring people together. Maybe we could organize monthly community clean-up events in local parks as a way to get started.

>>Historian: Well, let's consider the historical context here. We've seen in the past how certain policies have either succeeded or failed in promoting multiculturalism. Learning from those examples is crucial as we move forward with our plans.

>>Sociologist: To sum up, we've discussed creating shared spaces like community gardens and ensuring they're supported by inclusive policies. It's important that these initiatives are practical and grounded in reality.

>>Political Scientist: Exactly, and we must ensure that these shared spaces are not just physical locations but also platforms for policy-driven initiatives. The fundamental issue is integrating these ideas into our existing governance structures effectively.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: And you know what? It's about making sure everyone feels included in these efforts—whether through policy or grassroots movements—so no one feels left out.

>>Immigration Policy Expert: Let's see... I think another important aspect is continuous evaluation of these initiatives to ensure they're meeting their goals and adapting as needed.

>>Community Leader: Yes! And let's not forget the power of storytelling in bringing communities together—sharing experiences can really bridge gaps between different cultures.

>>Historian: Reflecting on historical successes and failures will help us avoid repeating mistakes while building on what worked well before."
