Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth. It consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the mouth, most commonly focused on dentition (the development and arrangement of teeth) as well as the oral mucosa.[2] Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.

The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization, with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC.[3] Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine which has gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specializations.[4] Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish. In European history, dentistry is considered to have stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons.[5]

Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries (such as dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and dental therapists). Most dentists either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals, or (secondary care) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific research and evidence to guide decision-making such as in manual tooth conservation, use of fluoride water treatment and fluoride toothpaste, dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis, as well as systematic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS which could also affect the oral cavity. Other practices relevant to evidence-based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect teeth deformity or oral malaises, haematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery, cardiology (due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery with patients with heart disease), etc.

The term dentistry comes from dentist, which comes from French dentiste, which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth.[6] The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology (from Ancient Greek: ὀδούς, romanized: odoús, lit. 'tooth') – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.

Dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity.[7] According to the World Health Organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.[8]

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the restoration of teeth, extraction or surgical removal of teeth, scaling and root planing, endodontic root canal treatment, and cosmetic dentistry[9]

By nature of their general training, dentists, without specialization can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic (dentures), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications used in the field such as antibiotics, sedatives, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.

Dentists also encourage the prevention of oral diseases through proper hygiene and regular, twice or more yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease or cancer.[7][10][13][14] Many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and preterm birth. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as ""oral-systemic health"".

John M. Harris started the world's first dental school in Bainbridge, Ohio, and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a dental museum.[15] The first dental college, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the Ohio College of Dental Surgery, established in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1845.[16] The Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery followed in 1852.[17] In 1907, Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries,[18] or even from different dental schools in one country,[19] may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from Israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.[20]

In the United Kingdom, the first dental schools, the London School of Dental Surgery and the Metropolitan School of Dental Science, both in London, opened in 1859.[21] The British Dentists Act of 1878 and the 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of ""dentist"" and ""dental surgeon"" to qualified and registered practitioners.[22][23] However, others could legally describe themselves as ""dental experts"" or ""dental consultants"".[24] The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry.[25] The British Dental Association, formed in 1880 with Sir John Tomes as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally.[22] Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the General Dental Council.

In many countries, dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree. In a few countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study;[26] Dental degrees awarded around the world include the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) and Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) in North America (US and Canada), and the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae (BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc) in the UK and current and former British Commonwealth countries.

All dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a ""Doctor of Dental Surgery"" (DDS) or ""Doctor of Dental Medicine"" (DMD). Specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of Anesthesiology, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orofacial Pain, Pathology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry (Pedodontics), Periodontics, and Prosthodontics.[27]

Some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:

Tooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the advent of farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay (cavities).[32] An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry,[33] although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the Neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools.[34] In Italy evidence dated to the Paleolithic, around 13,000 years ago, points to bitumen used to fill a tooth[35] and in Neolithic Slovenia, 6500 years ago, beeswax was used to close a fracture in a tooth.[36] The Indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC, during the Stone Age.[37] The Neolithic site of Mehrgarh (now in Pakistan's south western province of Balochistan) indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead-crafters.[3] The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective.[38] The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in Slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago.[39] Dentistry was practised in prehistoric Malta, as evidenced by a skull which had a dental abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around 2500 BC.[40] The practice of dentistry dates back thousands of years, with evidence of dental procedures such as tooth extraction and fillings found in ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and the Greeks. One notable historical figure is Pierre Fauchard, often referred to as the 'father of modern dentistry,' who wrote the first comprehensive book on the subject in 1728.

An ancient Sumerian text describes a ""tooth worm"" as the cause of dental caries.[41] Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the Homeric Hymns,[42] and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon Guy de Chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.[43]

Recipes for the treatment of toothache, infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Papyri, Brugsch Papyrus, and Hearst papyrus of Ancient Egypt.[44] The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws.[44][45] In the 18th century BC, the Code of Hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment.[46] Examination of the remains of some ancient Egyptians and Greco-Romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics.[47] However, it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons.[44]

Ancient Greek scholars Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with forceps, and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws.[48] Use of dental appliances, bridges and dentures was applied by the Etruscans in northern Italy, from as early as 700 BC, of human or other animal teeth fastened together with gold bands.[49][50][51] The Romans had likely borrowed this technique by the 5th century BC.[50][52] The Phoenicians crafted dentures during the 6th–4th century BC, fashioning them from gold wire and incorporating two ivory teeth.[53] In ancient Egypt, Hesy-Ra is the first named ""dentist"" (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire. Roman medical writer Cornelius Celsus wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing emollients and astringents.[54] The earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang dynasty medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.[55][56]

During the Islamic Golden Age Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as The Canon in medicine written by Avicenna and Al-Tasreef by Al-Zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the Middle Ages,[57] Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. Al-Zahrawi invented over 200 surgical tools that resemble the modern kind.[58]

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the Middle Ages and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. Barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican[59] (resembling a pelican's beak) which was used to perform dental extractions up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the dental key[60] which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.[61]

The first book focused solely on dentistry was the ""Artzney Buchlein"" in 1530,[48] and the first dental textbook written in English was called ""Operator for the Teeth"" by Charles Allen in 1685.[23]

In the United Kingdom, there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.[62]

It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician Thomas Browne in his A Letter to a Friend (c. 1656 pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:

The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.
The French surgeon Pierre Fauchard became known as the ""father of modern dentistry"". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled surgeon who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from watchmakers, jewelers and even barbers, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities. He asserted that sugar-derived acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay, and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the gums could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.[63][64]

Fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he invented many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. He also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist. The French text included ""basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery"".[63][64]

After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, Natural History of Human Teeth (1771) and Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth (1778), were published by British surgeon John Hunter. In 1763, he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of a successful tooth transplant (initially, at least) would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient. These principles are still used in the transplantation of internal organs. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.[65]

Major advances in science were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK, the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, Francis Brodie Imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.[66]

Long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear.[67] NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA.[68] For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.

Within the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners.[69] While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA,[70] prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus.[71] Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices,[72][73] which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.

There is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. Evidence-based dentistry (EBD) uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients.[74] It was first introduced by Gordon Guyatt and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s. It is part of the larger movement toward evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based practices, especially since a major part of dentistry involves dealing with oral and systemic diseases. Other issues relevant to the dental field in terms of evidence-based research and evidence-based practice include population oral health, dental clinical practice, tooth morphology etc. 

Dentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence-based clinical skills that can only be acquired through supervised specialized laboratory training and direct patient care.[75] This necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of extensive research-based education.[76] According to some experts, the accreditation of dental schools can enhance the quality and professionalism of dental education.[77][78]

>>Dental Educator: Doing well! It's nice to catch up with everyone outside of work.
>>Dental Researcher: Same here, been buried in research papers lately.
>>Public Health Expert: I'm alright too. Been busy with some new initiatives but glad to take a break.
>>Dentist: Absolutely, it's important to have these moments. So, what's been keeping everyone busy lately? 
 >>Dental Historian: You know, the history of dentistry reveals that ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Greeks were already performing dental procedures such as tooth extractions and fillings. Isn't that fascinating?
>>Dental Educator: Absolutely! It's amazing to see how far we've come from those early days. The evolution of dental tools and techniques has been quite remarkable. From using bow drills in ancient times to our modern high-tech equipment, it's like night and day!
>>Dental Researcher: Studies have shown that advancements in dental tools have significantly improved patient outcomes. Modern equipment, like ultrasonic scalers—those are the ones that use sound waves to clean teeth—really enhance efficiency and reduce discomfort during procedures.
>>Dentist: Yeah, I can definitely attest to that. Using these modern tools has transformed patient care in my practice. It’s great to see patients more comfortable during treatments.
>>Public Health Expert: And when we talk about these advancements, it's important to consider their impact on population health too. Better tools mean more effective treatments which can lead to a decrease in oral diseases across communities.
>>Dental Historian: According to historical records, the practice of dentistry has evolved significantly over millennia. Each advancement marks a remarkable leap in patient care and treatment efficacy.
>>Dental Educator: So true! Teaching future dentists now involves not just imparting knowledge but also fostering critical thinking and adaptability with all these new technologies.
>>Dental Researcher: Exactly, integrating scientific research into dental practices is crucial. Evidence-based dentistry really enhances treatment efficacy and aligns with broader public health goals.
>>Public Health Expert: Right, better tools mean more effective treatments which can lead to a decrease in oral diseases across communities. 
 >>Dentist: You know, one of the most rewarding aspects of clinical dentistry is seeing the immediate impact on a patient's life. I remember this one patient who was terrified of dental visits due to past experiences. We took it slow, explained every step, and by the end, she was smiling and even said 'Wow!' at how painless it was. It's incredible to see such transformations.

>>Dental Educator: Teaching future dentists is incredibly rewarding too. I had a student who struggled with patient communication. We worked on role-playing scenarios, and by the end of the semester, he was confidently explaining procedures to patients. Seeing that growth firsthand is amazing!

>>Public Health Expert: I agree with what the Dentist said about patient transformations. Poor oral health can lead to serious issues like heart disease and diabetes. It's all connected! Improving oral health can have a huge impact on overall well-being.

>>Dental Researcher: Our research shows that integrating scientific advancements like new treatment protocols can benefit more patients. For instance, using evidence-based practices in everyday clinical work really makes a difference.

>>Dental Historian: Interestingly enough, in history, dentistry has always been about transformation and care. From ancient civilizations using rudimentary tools to modern evidence-based practices, the evolution is remarkable! These advancements have shaped patient experiences over time.

>>Dentist: One practical application I find most rewarding is using evidence-based practices to improve patient outcomes. For example, integrating new treatment protocols into routine care has significantly improved my patients' oral health.

>>Dental Educator: One of the most fulfilling aspects of teaching is witnessing students' growth firsthand. I had a student who was initially very nervous about performing procedures on patients. We focused on building his confidence through simulated practice and real patient interactions. By the end of the year, he was handling complex cases with ease.

>>Public Health Expert: Well said! Integrating preventive measures in dental practices benefits not just oral health but general population health too.

>>Dental Researcher: Studies show that teaching students with evidence-based methods really helps them become better at diagnosing and treating diseases. 
 >>Dentist: You know, evidence-based practices are key in dentistry. Fluoride treatments really help cut down on cavities.
>>Dental Historian: Absolutely! And it's fascinating how fluoride has been used since it was first introduced back in the mid-20th century. Its impact on oral health practices is profound.
>>Dental Researcher: Right, and our studies show that fluoride not only fights cavities but also strengthens teeth and prevents demineralization.
>>Dental Educator: Teaching our students about these advancements is crucial for their future success. They need to understand how important fluoride is in preventing dental issues.
>>Public Health Expert: Regular use of fluoride contributes to overall well-being by preventing systemic diseases linked to poor oral health. But we also need to be mindful of potential risks like dental fluorosis from overexposure.
>>Dentist: Considering the practical application of fluoride treatments in clinical dentistry, it's clear these practices are essential for improving patient outcomes.
>>Dental Historian: The historical evolution of evidence-based practices in dentistry is quite remarkable! Integrating scientific research into dental care has transformed our approach to oral health over time.
>>Dental Researcher: From a scientific perspective, we should consider the broader implications of fluoride use. Oral health can significantly impact conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
>>Dental Educator: Exactly, teaching our students about the broader implications of fluoride use is essential. It's not just about preventing cavities; it's also about understanding how oral health impacts systemic conditions. 
 >>Dentist: Speaking of education, it's crucial for dental students to get hands-on experience with various specialties. For instance, working with children requires a unique approach to make them comfortable during treatments. Does that make sense?
>>Dental Educator: Absolutely! After completing their initial degree, students can choose to specialize in areas like orthodontics or oral surgery. These fields require additional training and hands-on experience to master the techniques involved.
>>Dental Researcher: Actually, empirical data shows that evidence-based dentistry significantly enhances the quality of dental education. Integrating scientific research into clinical training improves diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes for students specializing in these areas.
>>Public Health Expert: Um, let's consider the impact of oral health on overall well-being. When dental students specialize in areas like orthodontics or oral surgery, they're not just learning techniques; they're also contributing to population health by addressing specific needs. How does this affect community health outcomes?
>>Dentist: Practical application is key in dental education. When students get hands-on experience with different specialties, they really start to understand the nuances of patient care.
>>Dental Educator: It's amazing how dental education has evolved to include such specialized training. When students dive into areas like orthodontics or oral surgery, they really start to appreciate the unique challenges and rewards of each specialty.
