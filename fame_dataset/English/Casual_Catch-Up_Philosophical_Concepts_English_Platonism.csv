Platonism,"Platonism is the philosophy of Plato and philosophical systems closely derived from it, though contemporary Platonists do not necessarily accept all doctrines of Plato.[1] Platonism has had a profound effect on Western thought. At the most fundamental level, Platonism affirms the existence of abstract objects, which are asserted to exist in a third realm distinct from both the sensible external world and from the internal world of consciousness, and is the opposite of nominalism.[1] This can apply to properties, types, propositions, meanings, numbers, sets, truth values, and so on (see abstract object theory). Philosophers who affirm the existence of abstract objects are sometimes called Platonists; those who deny their existence are sometimes called nominalists. The terms ""Platonism"" and ""nominalism"" also have established senses in the history of philosophy. They denote positions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract object.[2]

In a narrower sense, the term might indicate the doctrine of Platonic realism, a form of mysticism [citation needed]. The central concept of Platonism, a distinction essential to the Theory of Forms, is the distinction between the reality which is perceptible but unintelligible, associated with the flux of Heraclitus and studied by the likes of physical science, and the reality which is imperceptible but intelligible, associated with the unchanging being of Parmenides and studied by the likes of mathematics. Geometry was the main motivation of Plato, and this also shows the influence of Pythagoras. The Forms are typically described in dialogues such as the Phaedo, Symposium and Republic as perfect archetypes of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. Aristotle's Third Man Argument is its most famous criticism in antiquity.

In the Republic the highest form is identified as the Form of the Good, the source of all other Forms, which could be known by reason. In the Sophist, a later work, the Forms being, sameness and difference are listed among the primordial ""Great Kinds"". Plato established the academy, and in the 3rd century BC, Arcesilaus adopted academic skepticism, which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BC when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and began a period known as Middle Platonism.

In the 3rd century AD, Plotinus added additional mystical elements, establishing Neoplatonism, in which the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things; in virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One. Many Platonic notions were adopted by the Christian church which understood Plato's Forms as God's thoughts (a position also known as divine conceptualism), while Neoplatonism became a major influence on Christian mysticism in the West through Saint Augustine, Doctor of the Catholic Church, who was heavily influenced by Plotinus' Enneads,[3] and in turn were foundations for the whole of Western Christian thought.[4] Many ideas of Plato were incorporated by the Roman Catholic Church.[5]

The primary concept is the Theory of Forms. The only true being is founded upon the forms, the eternal, unchangeable, perfect types, of which particular objects of moral and responsible sense are imperfect copies. The multitude of objects of sense, being involved in perpetual change, are thereby deprived of all genuine existence.[6] The number of the forms is defined by the number of universal concepts which can be derived from the particular objects of sense.[6] The following excerpt may be representative of Plato's middle period metaphysics and epistemology:

[Socrates:] ""Since the beautiful is opposite of the ugly, they are two.""

[Glaucon:] ""Of course.""
""And since they are two, each is one?""
""I grant that also.""
""And the same account is true of the just and unjust, the good and the bad, and all the forms. Each of them is itself one, but because they manifest themselves everywhere in association with actions, bodies, and one another, each of them appears to be many.""
""That's right.""
""So, I draw this distinction: On one side are those you just now called lovers of sights, lovers of crafts, and practical people; on the other side are those we are now arguing about and whom one would alone call philosophers.""
""How do you mean?""
""The lovers of sights and sounds like beautiful sounds, colors, shapes, and everything fashioned out of them, but their thought is unable to see and embrace the nature of the beautiful itself.""
""That's for sure.""
""In fact, there are very few people who would be able to reach the beautiful itself and see it by itself. Isn't that so?""
""Certainly.""
""What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself and isn't able to follow anyone who could lead him to the knowledge of it? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? Isn't this dreaming: whether asleep or awake, to think that a likeness is not a likeness but rather the thing itself that it is like?""
""I certainly think that someone who does that is dreaming.""
""But someone who, to take the opposite case, believes in the beautiful itself, can see both it and the things that participate in it and doesn't believe that the participants are it or that it itself is the participantsâ€”is he living in a dream or is he awake?
""He's very much awake.""


(Republic Bk. V, 475e-476d, translation G. M. A. Grube)
Book VI of the Republic identifies the highest form as the Form of the Good, the cause of all other Ideas, and that on which the being and knowing of all other Forms is contingent. Conceptions derived from the impressions of sense can never give us the knowledge of true being, i.e., of the forms.[6] It can only be obtained by the soul's activity within itself, apart from the troubles and disturbances of sense; that is to say, by the exercise of reason.[6] Dialectic, as the instrument in this process, leading us to knowledge of the forms, and finally to the highest form of the Good, is the first of sciences.[6] Later Neoplatonism, beginning with Plotinus, identified the Good of the Republic with the transcendent, absolute One[7] of the first hypothesis of the Parmenides (137c-142a).

Platonist ethics is based on the Form of the Good. Virtue is knowledge, the recognition of the supreme form of the good.[6] And, since in this cognition, the three parts of the soul, which are reason, spirit, and appetite, all have their share, we get the three virtues, Wisdom, Courage, and Moderation.[6] The bond which unites the other virtues is the virtue of Justice, by which each part of the soul is confined to the performance of its proper function.[6]

Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought. In many interpretations of the Timaeus Platonism,[8] like Aristotelianism, poses an eternal universe, as opposed to the nearby Judaic tradition that the universe had been created in historical time, with its continuous history recorded. Unlike Aristotelianism, Platonism describes idea as prior to matter and identifies the person with the soul. Many Platonic notions secured a permanent place in Christianity.[9]

At the heart of Plato's philosophy is the theory of the soul. Francis Cornford described the twin pillars of Platonism as being the theory of the Forms, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.[10] Indeed, Plato was the first person in the history of philosophy to believe that the soul was both the source of life and the mind.[11] In Plato's dialogues, the soul plays many disparate roles. Among other things, Plato believes that the soul is what gives life to the body (which was articulated most of all in the Laws and Phaedrus) in terms of self-motion: to be alive is to be capable of moving oneself; the soul is a self-mover. He also thinks that the soul is the bearer of moral properties (i.e., when I am virtuous, it is my soul that is virtuous as opposed to, say, my body). The soul is also the mind: it is that which thinks in us.


This casual oscillation between different roles of the soul is seen in many dialogues. First of all, in the Republic:
Is there any function of the soul that you could not accomplish with anything else, such as taking care of something (epimeleisthai), ruling, and deliberating, and other such things? Could we correctly assign these things to anything besides the soul, and say that they are characteristic (idia) of it?

No, to nothing else.

What about living? Will we deny that this is a function of the soul?


That absolutely is.[12]
The Phaedo most famously caused problems to scholars who were trying to make sense of this aspect of Plato's theory of the soul, such as Broadie[13] and Dorothea Frede.[14]

More-recent scholarship has overturned this accusation arguing that part of the novelty of Plato's theory of the soul is that it was the first to unite the different features and powers of the soul that became commonplace in later ancient and medieval philosophy.[11] For Plato, the soul moves things by means of its thoughts, as one scholar puts it, and accordingly, the soul is both a mover (i.e., the principle of life, where life is conceived of as self-motion) and a thinker.[11]

Platonism was originally expressed in the dialogues of Plato, in which the figure of Socrates is used to expound certain doctrines, that may or may not be similar to the thought of the historical Socrates, Plato's master. Plato delivered his lectures at the Platonic Academy, a precinct containing a sacred grove outside the walls of Athens. The school continued there long after Plato's death. There were three periods: the Old, Middle, and New Academy. The chief figures in the Old Academy were Speusippus (Plato's nephew), who succeeded him as the head of the school (until 339 BC), and Xenocrates (until 313 BC). Both of them sought to fuse Pythagorean speculations on number with Plato's theory of forms.

Around 266 BC, Arcesilaus became head of the academy. This phase, known as the Middle Academy, strongly emphasized philosophical skepticism. It was characterized by its attacks on the Stoics and their assertion of the certainty of truth and our knowledge of it. The New Academy began with Carneades in 155 BC, the fourth head in succession from Arcesilaus. It was still largely skeptical, denying the possibility of knowing an absolute truth; both Arcesilaus and Carneades argued that they were maintaining a genuine tenet of Plato.

Around 90 BC, Antiochus of Ascalon rejected skepticism, making way for the period known as Middle Platonism, in which Platonism was fused with certain Peripatetic and many Stoic dogmas. In Middle Platonism, the Platonic Forms were not transcendent but immanent to rational minds, and the physical world was a living, ensouled being, the World-Soul. Pre-eminence in this period belongs to Plutarch. The eclectic nature of Platonism during this time is shown by its incorporation into Pythagoreanism (Numenius of Apamea) and into Jewish philosophy[15] (Philo of Alexandria).

In the third century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which Middle Platonism was fused with mysticism. At the summit of existence stands the One or the Good, as the source of all things.[16] It generates from itself, as if from the reflection of its own being, reason, the nous, wherein is contained the infinite store of ideas.[16] The world-soul, the copy of the nous, is generated by and contained in it, as the nous is in the One, and, by informing matter in itself nonexistent, constitutes bodies whose existence is contained in the world-soul.[16] Nature therefore is a whole, endowed with life and soul. Soul, being chained to matter, longs to escape from the bondage of the body and return to its original source.[16] In virtue and philosophical thought it has the power to elevate itself above the reason into a state of ecstasy, where it can behold, or ascend to, that one good primary Being whom reason cannot know.[16] To attain this union with the Good, or the One is the true function of human beings.[16]

Plotinus' disciple, Porphyry, followed by Iamblichus, developed the system in conscious opposition to Christianityâ€”even as many influential early Christian writers took inspiration from it in their conceptions of monotheistic theology. The Platonic Academy was re-established during this period; its most renowned head was Proclus (died 485), a celebrated commentator on Plato's writings. The academy persisted until Roman emperor Justinian closed it in 529.

Platonism has had some influence on Christianity through Clement of Alexandria and Origen,[9] and the Cappadocian Fathers.[17] St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Platonism as well, which he encountered through the Latin translations of Marius Victorinus of the works of Porphyry and/or Plotinus.[9]

Platonism was considered authoritative in the Middle Ages.[9] Platonism also influenced both Eastern and Western mysticism.[9][18] Meanwhile, Platonism influenced various philosophers.[9] While Aristotle became more influential than Plato in the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy was still in certain respects fundamentally Platonic.[9]

The Renaissance also saw a renewed interest in Platonic thought, including more interest in Plato himself.[9] In 16th-, 17th-, and 19th-century England, Plato's ideas influenced many religious thinkers including the Cambridge Platonists.[9] Orthodox Protestantism in continental Europe, however, distrusts natural reason and has often been critical of Platonism.[9]
An issue in the reception of Plato in early modern Europe was how to deal with the same-sex elements of his corpus.[19]

Christoplatonism is a term used to refer to a dualism opined by Plato, which holds spirit is good but matter is evil,[20] which influenced some Christian churches, though the Bible's teaching directly contradicts this philosophy and thus it receives constant criticism from many teachers in the Christian Church today. According to the Methodist Church, Christoplatonism directly ""contradicts the Biblical record of God calling everything He created good.""[20]

Apart from historical Platonism originating from thinkers such as Plato and Plotinus, we also encounter the theory of abstract objects in the modern sense.

Platonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract objects â€” where an abstract object is an object that does not exist in space or time and which is therefore entirely non-physical and non-mental. Platonism in this sense is a contemporary view.[21]
This modern Platonism has been endorsed in one way or another at one time or another by numerous philosophers, such as Bernard Bolzano, who argue for anti-psychologism. Plato's works have been decisively influential for 20th century philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and his Process Philosophy; and for the critical realism and metaphysics of Nicolai Hartmann.

In contemporary philosophy, most Platonists trace their ideas to Gottlob Frege's influential paper ""Thought"", which argues for Platonism with respect to propositions, and his influential book, The Foundations of Arithmetic, which argues for Platonism with respect to numbers and is a seminal text of the logicist project.[21] Contemporary analytic philosophers who espoused Platonism in metaphysics include Bertrand Russell,[21] Alonzo Church,[21] Kurt GÃ¶del,[21] W. V. O. Quine,[21] David Kaplan,[21] Saul Kripke,[21] Edward Zalta[22] and Peter van Inwagen.[23] Iris Murdoch espoused Platonism in moral philosophy in her 1970 book The Sovereignty of Good.

Paul Benacerraf's epistemological challenge to contemporary Platonism has proved its most influential criticism.

In contemporary Continental philosophy, Edmund Husserl's arguments against psychologism are believed to derive from a Platonist conception of logic, influenced by Frege and his mentor Bolzano.[24]â€”Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, G. W. Leibniz and Hermann Lotze as inspirations for his position in his Logical Investigations (1900â€“1). Other prominent contemporary Continental philosophers interested in Platonism in a general sense include Leo Strauss,[25] Simone Weil,[26] and Alain Badiou.[27]

Platonism has not only influenced the tenets of Christianity[28] and Islam that are today classified as 'orthodox' teachings, but also the gnostic or esoteric 'heterodox' traditions of these religions that circulated in the ancient world, such as the former major world religion Manichaeism,[29][30] Mandaeism,[31] and Hermeticism. Through European Renaissance scholarship on Hermeticism and direct Platonic philosophy (among other esoteric and philosophical scholarship of the time, such as Jewish magic and mysticism and Islamic alchemy), the magic and alchemy of the period represents a culmination of several permutations of Platonic philosophy.

Julius Evola incorporated Platonic metaphysics into his vision of Roman pagan revival, aligning with his Traditionalist critique of modernity. Arturo Reghini, an Italian esotericist and collaborator of Evola, also promoted Neoplatonic ideas in his efforts to revive ancient Roman religion.[32]

I hope you're all doing well. So, our main objective for this meeting is to explore the intersections of Platonism with various fields such as art, politics, and psychology. But before we dive into that, how has everyone's week been?

>>Historian: It's been busy! I've been looking into some ancient Greek artâ€”Plato's influence is everywhere.

>>Classicist: Oh, that's interesting! Which artists have you found most influenced by Plato?

>>Historian: Quite a few actually, but Phidias stands out. His sculptures really strive for that ideal form Plato talks about.

>>Theologian: Reflective, actually. St. Augustine's writings have really got me thinking about Plato's ideas on the soul.

>>Psychologist: Interesting week! I've been exploring how Platonism affects our thinking and behavior.

>>Classicist: Pretty good! Re-reading Plato's dialogues always gives me new insights.

>>Philosophy Professor: That's great to hear from all of you! It sounds like we've all had some thought-provoking experiences this week related to our fields. Let's dive into our main discussion on Platonism and its impact across different areas. 
 >>Psychologist: I've been working on this new study about how people's belief in abstract concepts, like Plato's Forms, affects their decision-making. It's fascinating!

>>Historian: Oh, that sounds intriguing! I recently visited an archaeological site in Athens where they found what might be part of Plato's Academy. The artifacts could give us real insights into how his students applied his teachings.

>>Theologian: That's amazing! You know, I was reading St. Augustine's 'Confessions' recently, and it got me thinking about time and eternity. His reflections really echo Plato's ideas about the eternal Forms.

>>Classicist: Yeah, it's incredible how we can still find new meanings in these ancient texts. I reread Plato's 'Symposium' last weekend while relaxing at homeâ€”it really made me think about modern relationships differently.

>>Philosophy Professor: That's interesting! I haven't read much Augustine myself, but I know he was influenced by Plato. By the way, I attended a lecture on contemporary interpretations of Plato's 'Republic.' The speaker talked about how modern political theories still grapple with his ideas on justice and governance.

>>Psychologist: It's amazing how these ancient texts still influence us today.

>>Historian: Absolutely! And those discoveries at the siteâ€”

>>Classicist (interrupting): Yeah, it's incredible how we can still find new meanings in them.

>>Theologian: Reflecting upon St. Augustineâ€™s writings always brings new insights for me. His integration of Platonic thought into Christian theology is quite profound.

>>Philosophy Professor: Exactly! And mentoring students who are exploring these intersections is incredibly rewarding. Their fresh takes often inspire new lines of inquiry for me as well. 
 >>Historian: It's fascinating how Platonism didn't end with Plato. His Academy kept evolving, bringing in ideas from other schools. For example, Arcesilaus introduced skepticism, which was a big shift from Plato's original teachings.

>>Theologian: Absolutely. Platonism had a huge impact on Christian thought too. St. Augustine used Platonic ideas to explain how the eternal Forms could be seen as God's thoughts. We need to think about how these ideas influence our views on God and life.

>>Philosophy Professor: Right, Plato's Theory of Forms suggests that the true essence of reality is in these unchanging forms, not the physical world we see. This idea influenced both philosophy and theology deeply. If we see the Form of the Good as divine perfection, it's easy to understand why St. Augustine incorporated it into his view of God.

>>Classicist: And from a classical perspective, it's interesting to see this in Plato's dialogues like 'Republic' and 'Phaedo.' They show how the Theory of Forms impacted both philosophical and theological thought.

>>Psychologist (interjecting): If I may add something here! Isn't it interesting how these ideals can affect our mental health? Striving for an unattainable ideal might lead to stress or anxiety.

>>Classicist: Absolutely! That ties back to what I was saying about 'Phaedo.' Plato shows not just philosophical ideas but also their emotional impacts.

>>Psychologist: Exactly, believing in abstract concepts like Plato's Forms can really shape our thinking and behavior. People often strive for perfection based on these ideals, which can motivate them but also set unrealistic expectations.

>>(laughter)

>>Philosophy Professor (smiling): That's a great point!

>>(more laughter)

>>Historian (laughing): We're all very enthusiastic today!

>>(more laughter) 
 >>Classicist: You know, from a classical perspective, Plato's dialogues often serve as a rich tapestry of literary devices and philosophical inquiry. Take the 'Republic,' for instance. The allegory of the cave is not just a profound philosophical metaphor but also a masterful piece of narrative that engages readers on multiple levels.

>>Psychologist: Yeah, definitely. Psychologically speaking, Plato's allegory can be seen as a metaphor for cognitive dissonance. When people face new information that challenges their beliefs, they feel uncomfortable and resist it, like the prisoners in the cave who struggle to accept the reality outside.

>>Philosophy Professor: Absolutely. Itâ€™s not just about cognitive dissonance; it's also about the journey towards enlightenment and understanding higher truths. Plato really emphasized self-reflection and intellectual growth with his famous line, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.'

>>Historian: Right, and we can't forget the historical context here. The political turmoil in Athens during the Peloponnesian War had a big impact on Plato's work. His Academy wasn't just for abstract thought; it was also responding to the socio-political challenges of his time.

>>Theologian: That's an interesting point! The allegory of the cave also resonates with Christian theologyâ€”it's like moving from sin to salvation, from ignorance to divine truth. St. Augustine talked about our hearts being restless until they rest in God, which mirrors this journey.

>>Philosophy Professor: Good point! And if we think about contemporary philosophy, itâ€™s clear that Platoâ€™s ideas were precursors to modern existentialist thought. The prisoners' struggle to understand reality is similar to our quest for meaning in todayâ€™s world.

>>Classicist: Exactly! And letâ€™s not forget how Platoâ€™s use of dialogue itself is methodologically profound. It's like what Homer saidâ€”'A tale untold is like a song unsung.' Platoâ€™s dialogues invite us into deep pondering on reality and knowledge.

>>Psychologist: From another angle thoughâ€”the allegory shows how strong our cognitive biases are when faced with new paradigms challenging our mental frameworks. It can lead to significant internal conflict, much like those prisoners initially resisting the outside world.

>>Philosophy Professor: Indeed! If we delve deeper into this allegoryâ€”it comments on our perception of reality itself! Shadows represent limited understanding while the journey symbolizes philosophersâ€™ ascent towards knowledge and truth.

>>Historian: Remarkable! Historically speakingâ€”the context is crucial; Athens during the Peloponnesian War provided fertile ground influencing thoughts shaping presentation through dialogues during such tumultuous times! 
 >>Classicist: You know, from a classical perspective, one of the most captivating anecdotes about Plato involves his journey to Syracuse. Plato was invited by Dionysius the Elder, the tyrant of Syracuse, with hopes that he could influence the ruler towards a more philosophical and just governance. However, things took a dramatic turn when Plato's political ideals clashed with Dionysius' autocratic rule. This led to Plato being sold into slavery! Remarkable how even great philosophers faced such perilous adventures.

>>Theologian: That's fascinating! And it's interesting how Plato's ideas later influenced early Christian thought. St. Augustine saw Plato's Forms as divine ideasâ€”eternal and unchangingâ€”much like the nature of God Himself. This interpretation allowed for a harmonious blending of Platonic philosophy with Christian theology.

>>Historian: Building on what you both mentioned, Platoâ€™s Academy wasn't just a place for philosophical discourse; it also served as a sanctuary for intellectuals fleeing political turmoil. Many scholars sought refuge there during times of conflict, making it a hub of diverse ideas and debates.

>>Philosophy Professor: Speaking of travels, did you know that Plato's journey to Egypt is another fascinating tale? He traveled there to study with the priests and gain deeper insights into their wisdom and knowledge. This experience profoundly influenced his thoughts on the immortality of the soul and the nature of the divine.

>>Psychologist: From a psychological perspective, it's intriguing to consider how Plato's Theory of Forms might influence human cognition and behavior. The idea that there are perfect, unchanging forms could lead individuals to strive for unattainable ideals in various aspects of lifeâ€”from personal relationships to professional achievementsâ€”which might cause stress or dissatisfaction.

>>Classicist: Actuallyâ€”another intriguing anecdote about Plato involves his encounter with Pythagoreans during his travels in southern Italy. He met followers of Pythagoras who deeply influenced him with their mathematical and mystical teachings. This interaction significantly shaped his own philosophical ideasâ€”especially regarding abstract forms and a harmonious cosmos.

>>Theologian: Yes, those interactions were crucial! And speaking about influences, it's amazing how these ideas were integrated into early Christian thought. St. Augustine saw Plato's Forms as reflections of God's eternal truthsâ€”which allowed for a profound synthesis between Platonic philosophy and Christian theology.

>>Historian: Absolutelyâ€”and letâ€™s not forget how significant Platoâ€™s Academy was within Athens' political landscape during turbulent times like the Peloponnesian War. It wasnâ€™t just for philosophical discourse but also served as refuge for those seeking intellectual asylumâ€”a melting pot for revolutionary ideas. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Considering the contemporary relevance of Platonism, one might argue that Plato's Theory of Forms continues to influence modern metaphysical debates. For instance, the notion of abstract objects existing independently of our perception is echoed in current discussions about mathematical realism and the ontology of universals. But how do you think this framework applies to our understanding of digital realities?

>>Theologian: That's a fascinating question. Reflecting on Plato's Theory of Forms in light of divine wisdom, St. Augustine saw these eternal Forms as God's thoughts. This provides a bridge between Platonic ideals and Christian theology. Do you think virtual realities could serve as modern analogs to these divine archetypes?

>>Historian: I see where you're coming from. Historically, Plato's Theory can indeed be seen as a precursor to our understanding of virtual realities today. Just like Plato suggested that the physical world is a mere shadow of true reality, we might consider digital worlds as reflections or extensions of our own reality.

>>Classicist: Absolutely! And if we look at online games like 'The Sims,' they allow users to create idealized versions of life, which seems very much in line with striving towards an abstract perfectionâ€”similar to what Plato described.

>>Psychologist: I'm not as familiar with all the details of Plato's work, but from a psychological standpoint, pursuing these ideals in digital realities can lead to significant cognitive dissonance. When people strive for perfection online but face their imperfect real lives, it often results in stress and anxiety.

>>Philosophy Professor: So considering these psychological implications, does striving for Platonic ideals in digital realities help us understand our imperfections better or just amplify our anxieties? Are we not all prisoners mistaking shadows for reality?

>>Historian: That's an interesting point. Historically speaking, Plato's ideas have influenced philosophical thought and early Christian theology significantly. They even resonate with modern digital realities.

>>Theologian: Indeed! The pursuit of Platonic ideals in digital realms reflects our spiritual journey towards divine perfection. These virtual worlds might serve as contemporary analogs to eternal Forms guiding us towards understanding both our imperfections and aspirations.

>>Classicist: And elaborating on those psychological implications further highlights how Platoâ€™s Theory influences perceptions within digital realms. These spaces strive towards abstract perfection much like shadows in his allegoryâ€”a remarkable parallel!

>>Philosophy Professor: Reflecting on its ethical implications tooâ€”the pursuit within ideas realm guides moral development principles; applying Platonic ideals could evolve virtue & justice comprehension amidst modern dilemmas. 
 >>Psychologist: You know, speaking of lighthearted moments, I read about this study where people described their ideal day. It was fascinating! Most included simple pleasures like spending time with loved ones or enjoying nature.

>>Historian: Oh, that reminds me of an ancient Greek festival called Anthesteriaâ€”a three-day celebration for Dionysus with wine-drinking contests and pranks. Even back then, they knew how to have fun!

>>Theologian: Haha, that's great! And it makes me think of St. Augustine who humorously prayed for chastity and continence but added 'not yet.' Even saints had their moments of levity!

>>Philosophy Professor: Speaking of lighthearted moments, Socrates once attended a lavish banquet and remarked on the lack of wisdom and virtue there. He always had a way with words.

>>Classicist: That's classic Socrates! Reminds me of Aristophanes having an actor eat an entire roasted ox on stageâ€”imagine the spectacle!

>>Historian: And speaking of festivals, there's another one called Saturnalia in ancient Rome. It was a time when social norms were turned upside down; slaves dined with their masters and everyone exchanged gifts. Quite the party atmosphere!

>>Theologian: Reflect upon thisâ€”St. Francis of Assisi once humorously said he was married to Lady Poverty. Even saints had their humorous side.

>>Philosophy Professor: Well then, here's another one about Diogenes. Once seen wandering around Athens in broad daylight with a lantern, when asked what he was doing, he replied, 'I am looking for an honest man.' His wit and cynicism never fail to amuse.

>>Classicist: You know what's charming? The poet Sappho once playfully teased her friend Alcaeus by saying, 'If you had wanted to say something wise, you would have said it already!' Imagine the camaraderie they must have shared.

>>Psychologist: Speaking of camaraderie and humor in history always makes me think about how universal these experiences are across cultures.

>>Historian: Absolutely! And there's another story about Diogenes that always gets me laughing. He plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy after Plato defined humans as featherless bipeds! He declared it as Plato's humanâ€”imagine the laughter that must have ensued!

>>Theologian: Ah yes! Humor has always been part of human experienceâ€”even within religious contexts. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Well, um, reflecting on our discussions, I found the exploration of Plato's Theory of Forms particularly fascinating. The way we connected these ancient ideas to modern psychological and digital contexts was truly thought-provoking.

>>Historian: You know, the discussion on Plato's influence on early Christian thought really got me thinking. St. Augustine's integration of Platonic ideas into his theology provided a profound bridge between classical philosophy and Christian doctrine.

>>Theologian: Yeah, I really liked how we talked about Platonic ideals in Christian theology. As St. Augustine said, our souls are restless until they find rest in God, which ties back to Plato's idea of seeking ultimate good.

>>Classicist: From a classical perspective, I found our discussion on the allegory of the cave particularly compelling. Linking it to cognitive dissonance and modern existentialism was quite insightful. Plato's use of narrative devices in 'Republic' not only engages readers but also invites them to reflect deeply on their own perceptions of reality.

>>Psychologist: Um, from a psychological angle, I found our talk about cognitive dissonance related to Plato's allegory of the cave really intriguing. It highlights how deeply ingrained beliefs can shape our perception of reality and resistance to new information.

>>Philosophy Professor: So, what do you all think about planning our next catch-up session? Maybe we could dive deeper into another aspect of Platonism or explore a different philosopher altogether?

>>Historian: Actually, that sounds like a great idea! We could look at Aristotle next time and compare his views with Platoâ€™s.

>>Theologian: Yes! Exploring Aristotle would provide an interesting contrast to our current discussions and deepen our understanding further.

>>Classicist: Absolutely! And perhaps we could also touch upon how Aristotleâ€™s works influenced later literary traditions?

>>Psychologist: That sounds fantastic! I'm looking forward to seeing how these philosophical ideas continue to shape human cognition and behavior over time.

>>Philosophy Professor: Great! Let's plan for next month then? Same time?

>>Historian: That works for me!

>>Theologian: Sounds good.

>>Classicist: Perfect! Looking forward to it.

>>Psychologist: Great! Can't wait."
