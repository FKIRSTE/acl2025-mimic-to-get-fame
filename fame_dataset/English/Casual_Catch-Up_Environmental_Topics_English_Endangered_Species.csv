Endangered Species,"

An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, invasive species, and climate change.[1] The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.

Human activity is a significant cause in causing some species to become endangered.[2][3][4][5]

The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct.  Multiple factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[7]  The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[8]

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction,[9] but the frontier between categories such as 'endangered', 'rare', or 'locally extinct' species is often difficult to draw given the general paucity of data on most of these species. This is notably the case in the world Ocean where endangered species not seen for decades may go extinct unnoticed.[10]

Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans.

Though labeled a list, the IUCN Red List is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes ""Data Deficient"" (DD) species – species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined – as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process.[12] The species under the index include: mammals, birds, amphibians, cycads, and corals. Those species of ""Near Threatened"" (NT) and ""Least Concern"" (LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms ""endangered species"" and ""threatened species"" with particular meanings: ""Endangered"" (EN) species lie between ""Vulnerable"" (VU) and ""Critically Endangered"" (CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.[12]

Brazil is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, if not the most. It houses not only the Amazon forest but the Atlantic forest, the savanna-like Cerrado among other biomes.[13] Due to the high density of some of its well-preserved rainforests, wildlife trafficking, which along with deforestation is one of the biggest endangerment drivers in Brazil, has become a challenge. Brazil has a broad legal system meant to protect the environment, including its Constitution,[14] as well as several federal, state and local government agencies tasked with protecting the fauna and flora, fining individuals or companies linked to environmental crimes and confiscating illegally taken wildlife. Though such agencies can collect their data, each system operates relatively on its own when it comes to wildlife trafficking. However, both the agencies and the NGO's working in Brazil agree that the birds account for about 80% of trafficked species in the country.[15]

The relation between wildlife smuggling, other environment crimes under the Brazilian law such as deforestation, and endangered species is particularly intricate and troubling since the rarer the animal or plant gets the most targeted and valuable they become in the black market, which leads to more endangered species in its turn.[16]

Additionally, some environment experts and scientists point to the disbanding of environment agencies and the repeal of laws in Brazil under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro as one of the reasons behind a surge in the number of endangered species.[17] In one occasion during his presidency some fines totaling US$3.1 billion on environment criminals were revoked and at least one fine (related to illegal fishing) imposed on Bolsonaro himself was cancelled and the agent who fined him was demoted.[18]

In the past, Brazil has successfully saved the endemic golden lion tamarin from extinction. Massive campaigns to raise awareness among people by NGO's and governments, which included printing depictions of the golden lion tamarin in the 20 reais Brazilian banknotes (still in circulation), are credited with getting the species out of the critically endangered animals list.[19][20]

There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species database and the period that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.[21]

Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is asserted to be one of the leading causes of animal endangerment. According to the US National Park Service:[22] 
If we can sufficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of them will still have a chance to survive and recover. NASA scientist James Hanson has warned that in order to maintain a climate similar to that under which human civilization developed and similar to that which so many organisms are adapted, we need to quickly reduce the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to 350 parts per million (ppm). Before the industrial revolution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rarely rose above 280 ppm; during the 2014 calendar year, carbon dioxide levels fluctuated between 395 and 402 ppm.
Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States, species may be listed as ""endangered"" or ""threatened"". ""The Salt Creek tiger beetle"" is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. They are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list, which can be a long, controversial process.[23]

Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a ""taking"" of land by the government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from hunters and various industries like the petroleum industry, construction industry, and logging, has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.

The Bush administration lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the Obama administration, this policy was reinstated.[24]

Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.[25] This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.[26]

Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the ""shoot, shovel, and shut-up"" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat silently. Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.[27] The effectiveness of the ESA– which coined the term ""endangered species""– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered[28] and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.[29]

Currently, 1,556 endangered species are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[30]: 415  Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[30]: 416  This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

Ever since humankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from humankind, the dodo, passenger pigeon, great auk, Tasmanian tiger and Steller's sea cow are some of the more well known examples; with the bald eagle, grizzly bear, American bison, Eastern timber wolf and sea turtle having been poached to near-extinction.  Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or Haliaeetus leucocephalus is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.[31] A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes.  The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as Japan continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of ""scientific purposes"".[32] Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.

Endangered species are addressed through Canada's Species at Risk Act. A species is deemed threatened or endangered when it is on the verge of extinction or extirpation. Once a species is deemed threatened or endangered, the Act requires that a recovery plan to be developed that indicates how to stop or reverse the species' population decline.[33] As of 2021, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada has assessed 369 species as being endangered in Canada.

The World Wide Fund-India raises concern in the longevity of the following animal species: the Red Panda, the Bengal Tiger, the Ganges River Dolphin, the Asian Elephant.[34]

India signed the Wildlife Protection Act and also joined the Convention on the International Trade in 1976, to prevent poaching from harming its wildlife.[35]

The introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no exposure or resistance.[36]

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) emphasizes that our planet is warming at a rate faster than any time in the past 10,000 years, necessitating species to adapt to new climate patterns, such as variations in rainfall and longer, warmer summers.[37] For example, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service highlighted efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of climate change on species through scientific research, modeling, and conservation actions. This includes evaluating the current condition of species, their genetic variation, and how changes in their environment may affect their survival.[38]

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports that the approximately 1 °C rise in mean global temperature due to human activities is causing serious impacts on species, including changes in abundance, genetic composition, behavior, and survival. The IUCN stresses the importance of environmental policies aimed at reducing CO 2 emissions to lessen the impact of climate change on species. Tools like the IUCN Red List and guidelines for assessing species' vulnerability to climate change are vital for conservation efforts.[39]

In addition, climate change can lead to species decreasing in areas where they once thrived, by being forced to migrate or even going extinct from inhospitable conditions, invasive species, and fragmentation. A study cited by WWF found that one in six species is at risk of extinction due to climate change if no action is taken. The phenomenon of species shifting their ranges in response to changing climates, finding new or shrinking habitats, illustrates the direct impact of global warming on biodiversity.[37] Another major concern is rising ocean acidity caused from excess CO2 in the atmosphere. This creates acidic conditions in the ocean which creates an inhospitable environment for fish, plants, and other keystone species such as coral reefs[40]

For example, the Emperor Penguins, which rely on Antarctic sea ice for breeding, shelter, and food, are directly threatened by the melting of ice sheets. Similarly, the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan, adapted to alpine mountaintops, faces habitat loss due to climate changes in snowfall patterns and rising temperatures.[41]

Another example is in the case of the Salton Sea in California. This area is a critical habitat for many endangered and watched species, as well as many migratory birds. Due to environmental shifts from climate change and the addition of agriculture in the surrounding plains, the system has become almost irreparably damaged. The warming temperatures has caused mass evaporation, leaving the Sea much more saline and with much more exposed playa. This not only damages air quality but also has caused fish kills to accumulate as shown pictured below. This has made the system inhospitable to the birds and endangered species relying upon it [42]

Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it will not disappear.[43]


This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the Père David's deer. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. hilsa). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced gene pool and reduce resistance.
In 1981, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) created a Species Survival Plan (SSP) to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, some endangered species are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups. These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and some other wildlife conservation efforts. The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA – certified zoos and aquariums. Some animals that are part of SSP programs are giant pandas, lowland gorillas, and California condors.[44]

Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern black rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros. Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, ""Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into conservation programs. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work.""[45]

Conservation experts view the effect of China's turtle farming on the wild turtle populations of China and South-Eastern Asia– many of which are endangered– as ""poorly understood"".[46] Although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with farm-raised turtles in the marketplace– the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the ""visible"" trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007[47]– they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock. The conservation expert Peter Paul van Dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock. Turtle farmers may, therefore, seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species.[47]

In 2015, researchers in Australia managed to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the possibility that fish farming may be able to save the species from overfishing.[48]

Factors contributing to this risk include habitat loss, poaching, invasive species, and climate change. The IUCN Red List is a key tool for assessing global conservation status, with many nations implementing laws to protect these species through measures like hunting restrictions and protected areas. Human activity is a significant driver of endangerment, with over 50% of the world's species at risk. Brazil's biodiversity faces threats from wildlife trafficking and deforestation, exacerbated by recent political actions undermining environmental protections. Conservation efforts such as captive breeding have shown success in saving species like the golden lion tamarin. In the US, the Endangered Species Act has been effective despite controversies around land use restrictions and lobbying from various industries. Climate change poses a severe threat to species survival, necessitating urgent action to reduce CO2 emissions.

Hope you're all doing well.
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Morning! Did anyone catch the sunrise today? It was stunning!
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Yes, it was beautiful. Shall we get started on today's agenda?
>>Climate Change Scientist: Yeah, I noticed that too. By the way, let's discuss our plans for next month's conservation project.
>>Ecologist: Hi everyone! Did you see how vibrant the flowers are this season?
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Yes, they are beautiful! It's amazing how nature thrives during this time of year.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Indeed! The weather has been quite pleasant lately, which is great for our fieldwork on habitat restoration. 
 >>Conservation Biologist: We've seen from recent studies that habitat restoration efforts are yielding positive results for several endangered species. For instance, the population of the critically endangered Amur leopard has seen a slight increase due to targeted conservation actions. It's really important that we act quickly to ensure these gains are sustained.
>>Wildlife Conservationist: The success stories from the field are truly inspiring! We've seen significant progress with the golden lion tamarin in Brazil. Massive awareness campaigns and habitat restoration efforts have helped increase their population. Protecting our wildlife is crucial!
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Recent legislative changes have been quite impactful. New policies now mandate stricter penalties for illegal wildlife trafficking and increased funding for habitat restoration projects. Plus, integrating climate resilience into our strategies is essential as rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering habitats faster than many species can adapt.
>>Climate Change Scientist: Exactly, climate change is exacerbating the threats faced by endangered species. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering habitats faster than many species can adapt. Immediate action is needed to mitigate these impacts.
>>Ecologist: We also need to consider how these conservation efforts impact overall ecosystem dynamics. Restoring habitats not only benefits endangered species but also helps maintain ecosystem balance by supporting various other organisms. Every organism plays a role in this intricate web of life.
>>Conservation Biologist: What we need to think about is the long-term sustainability of these conservation efforts. While habitat restoration has shown promising results for species like the Amur leopard—
>>Wildlife Conservationist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! How do you measure long-term sustainability in such projects?
>>Conservation Biologist: Great question! Long-term sustainability can be measured through continuous monitoring of biodiversity indicators and assessing ecosystem health over time. It's crucial to ensure that restored habitats remain protected from future threats such as deforestation and climate change.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Furthermore, policy dictates that we must integrate climate resilience into our conservation strategies to mitigate impacts effectively.
>>Ecologist: And those policies will definitely help maintain ecosystem balance by supporting various organisms within restored habitats.
>>Wildlife Conservationist (interrupting): Have you ever wondered how small actions like awareness campaigns can lead to big changes? It's amazing!
>>Conservation Biologist: Absolutely! Awareness campaigns play a vital role in mobilizing public support and ensuring community involvement in conservation efforts. 
 >>Climate Change Scientist: According to the latest research, climate change is having a profound impact on biodiversity. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering habitats at an unprecedented rate. We need immediate action to mitigate these effects if we want to preserve endangered species.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: We need to make sure we're following current environmental laws to help protect endangered species. Integrating climate resilience into our conservation strategies is crucial. Legislative frameworks like the Endangered Species Act play a vital role in this regard.
>>Conservation Biologist: In addition to policy measures, we should focus on community engagement to support local conservation efforts. The relationship between climate change and species endangerment is intricate. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are not just changing habitats but also increasing the vulnerability of already endangered species.
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Protecting our wildlife is crucial! One practical solution we can implement is creating more protected areas and wildlife corridors. These spaces allow species to move freely and adapt to changing conditions. I've seen firsthand how they help animals like the Amur leopard thrive!
>>Ecologist: That's a great point! Creating wildlife corridors not only helps species adapt but also maintains ecosystem dynamics by connecting fragmented habitats.
>>Conservation Biologist: And let's not forget the role of invasive species in exacerbating the challenges posed by climate change. These non-native species often outcompete local fauna and flora, further destabilizing already fragile ecosystems.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Furthermore, we must ensure compliance with international agreements like the Convention on Biological Diversity. These frameworks guide our conservation efforts effectively.
>>Conservation Biologist: It's important for captive breeding programs to keep genetic diversity high so species stay healthy. Without a diverse gene pool, they're less resilient to environmental changes and diseases.
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Honestly, creating wildlife corridors is a fantastic idea! They not only help species adapt but also connect fragmented habitats, supporting genetic diversity and reducing the risk of inbreeding.
>>Ecologist: Exactly! Fragmented habitats can isolate populations leading to reduced gene flow and increased inbreeding risks.
>>Climate Change Scientist: Habitat restoration plays a significant role in combating climate change impacts too. Restoring degraded habitats enhances carbon sequestration and provides refuges for affected species. 
 >>Wildlife Conservationist: You know, one of the most memorable experiences I had was in Brazil, working on a project to save the golden lion tamarin. Honestly, seeing these vibrant little monkeys thriving again after years of decline was just amazing!
>>Conservation Biologist: One of the most impactful moments for me was during a research trip to Madagascar. We were studying the critically endangered lemurs, and I remember vividly how their habitat was being encroached upon by illegal logging. It broke my heart seeing their home destroyed. It's a stark reminder that we must act now to protect these unique species.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: The rules in Brazil are pretty strict about protecting endangered species. Agencies can enforce tough penalties against illegal logging and wildlife trafficking. But we need to make sure everyone follows them and get local communities involved to really make a difference!
>>Ecologist: Moreover, what we need to consider is how ecosystem dynamics play a crucial role in conservation efforts. For instance, during my research in the Congo Basin—
>>Climate Change Scientist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! Speaking of interconnectedness, have you noticed how climate change makes these issues worse? It's like everything is linked.
>>Ecologist: Absolutely! That's a great point. During my research in the Congo Basin, I observed how climate change is affecting these ecosystems too. Every organism plays a role in maintaining balance.
>>Conservation Biologist: During another trip to the Galápagos Islands, I saw firsthand how invasive species were threatening native wildlife. The delicate balance of these ecosystems is so easily disrupted; it was a stark reminder that every species matters.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Indeed! The rules in Madagascar also highlight the importance of community involvement in conservation efforts. Local communities must be engaged in sustainable practices to protect endangered species like lemurs. How can we ignore this when it's proven effective?
>>Conservation Biologist: And speaking of community engagement, during my time working on habitat restoration projects in Costa Rica, I saw how involving locals made such a huge difference. They were passionate about protecting their environment and it showed real results. 
 >>Wildlife Conservationist: You know, I recently tried my hand at painting. It's been such a relaxing way to unwind after long days in the field!
>>Environmental Policy Expert: That sounds wonderful! I've started gardening myself—it's quite therapeutic to nurture plants and watch them grow.
>>Conservation Biologist: Gardening is great! I've been getting into photography lately, capturing nature's intricate details through a lens.
>>Climate Change Scientist: Photography sounds fascinating! Do you have any favorite subjects or places you like to shoot?
>>Conservation Biologist: Definitely! I love capturing the early morning light in forests and close-ups of insects. What about you? Any outdoor hobbies?
>>Climate Change Scientist: Well, I've taken up bird watching. It's amazing how much you can learn just by observing them in their natural habitat.
>>Ecologist: Bird watching is so peaceful. Hiking has been my go-to activity lately—exploring new trails is refreshing and invigorating!
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Hiking is fantastic! Kayaking has been my latest adventure. It's exhilarating to explore new places on the water.
>>Environmental Policy Expert: Speaking of exploring, I've also enjoyed experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen lately—baking bread has become a bit of a hobby for me.
>>Conservation Biologist: Baking bread is so rewarding! There's something special about creating something from scratch. 
 >>Environmental Policy Expert: As we plan future projects, it's really important that we follow the latest environmental regulations to protect endangered species. We can't ignore how crucial it is to integrate climate resilience into our strategies.
>>Wildlife Conservationist: Creating wildlife corridors to connect fragmented habitats could really help species migrate safely and maintain genetic diversity.
>>Conservation Biologist: That's a great point! And if we combine that with captive breeding programs, we can boost genetic diversity even further and ensure the long-term survival of critically endangered species.
