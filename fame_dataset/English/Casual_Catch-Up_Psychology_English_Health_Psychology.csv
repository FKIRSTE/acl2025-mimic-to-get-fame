Health Psychology,"

Health psychology is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare.[1] The discipline is concerned with understanding how psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors contribute to physical health and illness. Psychological factors can affect health directly. For example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, cumulatively, can harm health. Behavioral factors can also affect a person's health. For example, certain behaviors can, over time, harm (smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol) or enhance (engaging in exercise) health.[2] Health psychologists take a biopsychosocial approach. In other words, health psychologists understand health to be the product not only of biological processes (e.g., a virus, tumor, etc.) but also of psychological (e.g., thoughts and beliefs), behavioral (e.g., habits), and social processes (e.g., socioeconomic status and ethnicity).[2]

By understanding psychological factors that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) to apply the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in public health departments working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct research.

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of clinical psychology,[3] four different divisions within health psychology[4] and one related field, occupational health psychology (OHP),[5][6][7][8] have developed over time. The four divisions include clinical health psychology, public health psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology.[4] Professional organizations for the field of health psychology include Division 38 of the American Psychological Association (APA),[9] the Division of Health Psychology of the British Psychological Society (BPS),[10] the European Health Psychology Society (EHPS),[11] and the College of Health Psychologists of the Australian Psychological Society (APS).[12] Advanced credentialing in the US as a clinical health psychologist is provided through the American Board of Professional Psychology.[13]

Recent advances in psychological, medical, and physiological research have led to a new way of thinking about health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the biopsychosocial model, views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, social support).[citation needed]

Psychologists who strive to understand how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.[14] They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles and try to find ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or stop smoking.[14] Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.[14]
Health psychologists work in many different settings including the UK's National Health Service (NHS), private practice, universities, communities, schools and organizations. While many health psychologists provide clinical services as part of their duties, others function in non-clinical roles, primarily involving teaching and research. Leading journals include Health Psychology, the Journal of Health Psychology, the British Journal of Health Psychology,[15] and Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being.[16] Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.[14]

Health psychology, like other areas of applied psychology, is both a theoretical and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized experiments, quasi-experiments, longitudinal studies, time-series designs, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, qualitative research as well as action research. Health psychologists study a broad range of health phenomena including cardiovascular disease (cardiac psychology), smoking habits, the relation of religious beliefs to health, alcohol use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, alcohol problems, etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.[citation needed]

ClHP is the application of scientific knowledge, derived from the field of health psychology, to clinical questions that may arise across the spectrum of health care.  ClHP is one of the specialty practice areas for clinical and health psychologists. It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of behavioral health and the treatment-oriented field of behavioral medicine. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of behavior change, and psychotherapy. In some countries, a clinical health psychologist, with additional training, can become a medical psychologist and, thereby, obtain prescription privileges.[citation needed]

PHP is population-oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health. PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including epidemiology, nutrition, genetics and biostatistics. Some PHP interventions are targeted toward at-risk population groups (e.g., undereducated, single pregnant women who smoke) and not the population as a whole (e.g., all pregnant women).[citation needed]

CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities. CoHP also develops community-level interventions that are designed to combat disease and promote physical and mental health. The community often serves as the level of analysis, and is frequently sought as a partner in health-related interventions.[citation needed] A prominent focus of community health psychology is how to promote and strengthen health systems in communities. By doing so, community health psychologists hope to improve health across generations in a family. This comes with a strong focus in maternal and child care to do so.[17]

CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy. CrHP prioritizes social justice and the universal right to health for people of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The critical health psychologist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloger. A leading organization in this area is the International Society of Critical Health Psychology.[citation needed]

Occupational health psychology brings together aspects of health psychology and industrial/organizational psychology to protect and improve health and workalike balance. Two of the main focuses are on occupational stress and workplace interventions. [18]Pickren and Degni[19] and Sanderson[20] observed that in Europe and North America, occupational health psychology (OHP) emerged as a specialty with its own organizations. The authors noted that OHP owes some of that emergence to health psychology as well as other disciplines (e.g., i/o psychology, occupational medicine). Sanderson underlined examples in which OHP aligns with health psychology, including Adkins's research. Adkins[21] documented the application of behavioral principles to improve working conditions, mitigate job stress, and improve worker health in a complex organization.[citation needed]

Current occupational health psychology research focuses on different job fields to more effectively determine how to improve organizational health. A job field that has received a lot of focus are nurses. Among nurses, there were two methods to reduce occupational stress. One method was implementing cognitive-behavioral skills training. This type of training focuses on emotional regulation, emotional intelligence, assertiveness, and time management. Another method to reduce occupational stress among nurses was mindfulness based intervention. Mindfulness-based intervention were taught to nurses as a way to stay present and was encourage to use before shifts or during busy shifts when it was chaotic. [22]

Health psychology developed in different forms in different societies.[23] Psychological factors in health had been studied since the early 20th century by disciplines such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology.[citation needed]

In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services.[24] While there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.[25]

Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. For example, the Alameda County Study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer.[26] In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones.[27] These discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems,[27] and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.[28]

Led by Joseph Matarazzo, in 1977, APA added a division devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, ""Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation.""[29] Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan.[30]

In the 1980s there was increasing interest in many European countries in researching psychological aspects of health and illness. In 1986, Stan Maes (1947–2018) of Tilburg University convened a meeting of researchers from Finland, Switzerland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, the UK and the Netherlands.  Out of this meeting emerged the European Health Psychology Society which began to organise regular conferences (e.g. Trier, 1988; Utrecht, 1989; Oxford, 1990; Lausanne, 1991; and Leipzig, 1992)[31] and published proceedings from these meetings.[32]  This society also began to develop its own publications.[33]

Psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed medical psychology). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness.[34] The BPS's reconsideration of the role of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field.[35] Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the BPS Bulletin that there was a great need for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair.[36] Annual conferences began to be held and began to map out the areas of interest.[37]  At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of ""Current Trends in Health Psychology"" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as ""the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare"" was proposed.[38]

The Health Psychology Section became a Special Group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the UK in 1997. The awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and members were able to obtain chartered status with the BPS. The BPS went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the Health Professions Council in 2010.[36]

A number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology. One of those trends being the addition of behavioral science to medical school curricula, with courses often taught by psychologists.[36] Another trend of the increased knowledge in health psychology is the training of health professionals in communication skills, with the aim of improving patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment.[36] Another impact of the emergence and focus on health psychology are the increasing numbers of interventions based on psychological theory (e.g., behavior modification)[36] and an increased understanding of the interaction between psychological and physiological factors leading to the emergence of psychophysiology and psychoneuroimmunology (PNI).[36] The health domain has also become a target of research by social psychologists interested in testing theoretical models linking beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.[39] Another important impact of the focus on health psychology and its research is the increase of and funding of research in the emergence of AIDS/HIV.[36] The emergence of academic /professional bodies to promote research and practice in health psychology was followed by the publication of a series of textbooks which began to lay out the interests of the discipline.[40]

Health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy.[41] Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking[42] in order to promote health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.[43]

Health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health. Physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. Some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco,[44] although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth.[45] OHP research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.[46][47]  Other research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure.[48][49] Epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.[50]

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens (also see health action process approach). Health psychologists employ cognitive behavioral therapy and applied behavior analysis (also see behavior modification) for that purpose.[citation needed]

Health psychologists promote health through behavioral change, as mentioned above; however, they attempt to prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people to make changes in their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly.[14] Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals.[51] Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.[52]

Health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness.[14] Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.[14] Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).[14]

Health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.[53]

There is also evidence from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier and his colleagues[54] have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.

Health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals' psychological well-being. An individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. These stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having one's sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. These stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.[55]

The use of medications can alter the microbiome and potentially impact overall health and the development of diseases. It has been discovered that the metabolites produced by intestinal microorganisms can influence one's health. For instance, antidepressants can modify the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which can then affect the course of the disease through changes in specific metabolites produced by certain intestinal microorganisms. This has significant implications, particularly in the context of depression, as it offers new insights into how to approach and treat the condition at hand.[56]

Health psychologists can support people living with long-term conditions to improve or maintain quality of life, self-manage their conditions, and adjust to life with an illness, disability or long-term condition.[citation needed]

Health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with terminal illness. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can work within a multi-disciplinary palliative care team to improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being.[57]

A form of therapy shown in recent studies is psychotherapy. It is used as a mode of intervention due to the inconsistency and issues that may arise from pharmacological interventions. It ensures the use of evidence-based practices and helps in facilitating adherence to medication regimens that may be impacted by psychiatric symptoms, such as low motivation or depressive symptoms. When using psychotherapeutic strategies, clinicians can choose from three modes: individual, family/couples, and group psychotherapy.[58]

Critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice.[59] These avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. The individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.[60]

Like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. Health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions.[61] For example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as:

Health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. Health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.[61]

Health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms (e.g., intestines).[62] One area of research on this topic involves ""doctor-centered"" or ""patient-centered"" consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.[63]

Health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.[64] Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people with chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.[65]

Health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients' adherence to medical regimens:

Health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic analgesia, causalgia, neuralgia, and phantom limb pain. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the McGill Pain Questionnaire[67] has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered analgesia, acupuncture (found to be effective in reducing pain for osteoarthritis of the knee[68]), biofeedback, and cognitive behavior therapy.

Midlife in the United States, also known as MIDUS, has sent out numerous surveys since its start in 1995. The goal of MIDUS was to collect data on the role of behavioral, social, and psychological factors on age-related outcomes on health and well-being. Since its start, MIDUS has sent out a variety of surveys and done an extensive amount of research pertaining to health psychology. Many researchers often refer back to MIDUS data for their own research as the MIDUS data is extensive and longitudinal.[69]

Done in 1995 to 1996, the MIDUS 1 project surveyed 7,108 individuals ages 25 to 75 years old. This sample also included the national sample of twins and siblings as a large sample of their participants. This survey was done through self-administered questionnaires and phone interviews. Participants were asked to provide information on their physical and mental health as well as insight on their lifestyle choices, demands of their career, substance use, sense of control over their health, and what their decision making process is.[69]

MIDUS 2 was completed in 2009 and was a longitudinal follow-up on all of the participants in the MIDUS 1 survey. Within MIDUS 2, there were five projects. Project 1 was a follow up on all of the questions asked in MIDUS 1 pertaining to psychosocial, sociodemographic, and health variables. Project 2 was a follow up of the daily diary in MIDUS 1. Project 3 was a new assessment of cognition in this sample and also included a follow up for the previous cognitive subsample from MIDUS 1. Project 4 was a biomarkers assessment on the participants. Project 5 was a neuroscience assessment on a subsample of those who participated in the biomarker study.[69]

The MIDUS Refresher study was done in 2011 through 2014. This study recruited a new sample of 3,577 adults between the ages of 25-74 and was designed to replenish the original MIDUS 1 sample in order to parallel the original survey. The MIDUS Refresher survey had the same assessments that were done with the existing MIDUS sample, but included additional questions about the effects of the economic recession that took place in 2008 through 2009. The MIDUS Refresher survey also included five projects. Project 1 was a 30 minute phone interview as well as a two 50 page self-administered questionnaires that were mailed to each participant. This was done to analyze the mental and physical effects related to the economic recession. Projects two through five followed the same pattern as the MIDUS 2 survey with daily diary, cognitive, biomarker, and neuroscience assessments respectively.[69]

A third wave of surveys were sent in 2013 to collect longitudinal data on the MIDUS Refresher participants. This survey followed the same structure as the MIDUS Refresher survey with the addition of questions about optimism and coping, stressful life events, and caregiving.[69]

MIDJA looks at 1,027 adults ages 30 to 79 in Japan, specifically the Tokyo metropolitan area, in 2008. This survey collected baseline data on sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial characteristics, and mental and physical health. In 2009, biomarker data was taken from these cases. This survey and the collection of biomarker data mirrored the longitudinal studies of MIDUS to analyze differences between the United States and Japan. In 2012, a longitudinal follow up was completed on MIDJA participants. This repeated the baseline assessments to further look at the differences between MIDUS and MIDJA data.[69]

One study used MIDUS 1 through 3 data to complete a longitudinal study. This study was looking at cognitive reappraisal, affective reactivity, and health. From the MIDUS data, they used the cognitive reappraisal, sociodemographics, daily stressors, daily negative affect, mental health scales, reported chronic conditions, and physical health data throughout these studies. What they found was that cognitive reappraisal was significantly associated with future health and well-being outcomes.[70]

Another study looked at daily stressors, positive events, and depression, specifically the difference in affect between groups with and without major depressive disorder. This study used MIDUS 1 and 2 data as well as the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE) which is a subset of the MIDUS data also knows and the daily diary project. The data taken from these surveys were reports of daily affect, daily stressors, daily positive events, and major depressive disorder. What was found was that those who had major depressive disorder and experiences at least one positive event that day reported a greater decrease of positive affect and greater increase of negative affect compared to groups without major depressive disorder.[71]

Another study looked at affective reactivity, heart rate, and marital quality. This study looked at the NSDE, Biomarker Project, and MIDUS 2 and 3 data. Within this, the variables of interest were daily stressors, affective reactivity, marital quality, and resting heart rate. What was found were greater affective reactivity to daily stressors predicted lower marital satisfaction and higher marital risk. In addition to that, resting heart rate moderated these associations. High levels of resting heart rate offset the negative relationship between affective reactivity and marital quality.[72]

MIDUS data is very important to and applicable in health psychology research. Since it looks at such a wide variety of variables, there are many different ways for researchers to analyze the data. It allows for a variety of different combinations of variables to compare, a large amount of longitudinal data, and so much research to build off of. The different variables allow for an intersection of data to present in health psychology because of the variety in physical health and mental health variables.

Below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the UK's NHS and private practice.

Healthcare professionals who treat individuals with mental health conditions prefer medications that provide energy and have fewer side effects. When prescribing psychiatric drugs, it is essential to consider individual needs, safety, and anti-doping policies. Psychologists patients prefer specific medications like escitalopram for anxiety, melatonin for insomnia, lamotrigine for bipolar disorders, and aripiprazole for psychotic disorders. This emphasizes the importance of personalized prescribing individuals.[73]

Universities began to develop doctoral-level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.[citation needed]

The term ""health psychologist"" is a protected title, with health psychologists required to register with the Health Professions Council (HPC) and have trained to a level to be eligible for full membership of the Division of Health Psychology within the BPS.[74]  Registered health psychologists who are chartered with the BPS will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training, with three of those years dedicated to health psychology training.[61] Following the completion of a BPS-accredited undergraduate degree in Psychology, aspiring health psychologists must first complete a BPS-accredited masters in health psychology (Stage 1 training). Once the trainee has completed Stage 1 training, they can either choose to complete the BPS' independent Stage 2 training route or sign up to an accredited health psychology doctorate program at a UK university (DHealthPsy). Both training routes require trainees to demonstrate they meet the core competencies of:

At present, there are limited opportunities for trainees to receive fully funded training. The NHS Education Scotland (NES) Stage 2 program funds several trainee health psychologists each year, providing trainees with fixed-term posts within NHS Boards across Scotland.[75] In 2022, a pilot scheme was launched by Health Education England (HEE) to provide similar opportunities to aspiring health psychologists across England.[citation needed]

Once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the NHS, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations.[61] A health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status.[61] All qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their continuing professional development (CPD) for psychology each year throughout their career.[74]

Health psychologists are registered by the Psychology Board of Australia.[76]  The standard pathway to becoming an endorsed health psychologists involves a minimum of six years training and a two-year registrar program.[77]  Health psychologists must also undertake continuing professional development (CPD) each year.[78]

Health psychologists are registered by the New Zealand Psychologists Board within the psychologist scope of practice.[79] The training pathway to becoming a registered health psychologist requires a Masters in Health Psychology and a two-year registration Postgraduate Diploma in Health Psychology at the University of Auckland.[80][81] Outside of clinical work in primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings, graduates may choose careers in research and health promotion in universities and private settings.[82] Health psychologists are able to join the Institute of Health Psychology (IHP), an institute of the New Zealand Psychological Society, as a practitioner, academic or student affiliate.[83]

health, illness, and healthcare. Health psychologists use a biopsychosocial approach to understand how biological, psychological, behavioral, and social factors contribute to physical health and illness. They work in various settings such as hospitals, clinics, public health departments, universities, and medical schools. The discipline has evolved from clinical psychology into four divisions: clinical health psychology, public health psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology. Occupational health psychology is also related. Professional organizations include APA's Division 38 and similar groups in the UK, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Recent advances have led to the biopsychosocial model of health. Health psychologists conduct research using diverse methods to study phenomena like cardiovascular disease and smoking habits. They aim to promote healthier lifestyles through prevention research and interventions while improving healthcare systems by advising on communication strategies between doctors and patients. Training programs for health psychologists are established globally with varying requirements for credentialing. Continuing professional development is mandatory across different countries.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a friendly tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick check-in on how everyone is doing\n- Mention the casual nature of the catch-up"", ""Scene 2: Health Psychology Overview\nTLDR: Introduce the main topic of health psychology and its relevance.\n- Brief summary of health psychology field\n- Importance of biopsychosocial approach\n- Mention different settings where health psychologists work"", ""Scene 3: Professional Insights\nTLDR: Share professional experiences related to health psychology.\n- Health Psychologist shares insights on biopsychosocial model\n- Medical Doctor discusses clinical applications in patient care\n- Public Health Specialist talks about community-level interventions"", ""Scene 4: Personal Experiences\nTLDR: Discuss personal experiences that relate to health psychology.\n- Participants share relevant personal stories or anecdotes\n- Encourage spontaneous contributions and reflections"", ""Scene 5: Recent Advances and Research Methods\nTLDR: Explore recent advances in health psychology and research methods used.\n- Discuss recent developments in biopsychosocial model\n- Talk about diverse research methods (e.g., studies on cardiovascular disease, smoking habits)\n- Open floor for questions and comments"", ""Scene 6: Promoting Healthier Lifestyles\nTLDR: Discuss strategies for promoting healthier lifestyles through prevention research and interventions.\n- Share examples of successful interventions (e.g., smoking cessation programs)\n- Discuss communication strategies between doctors and patients to improve healthcare systems"", ""Scene 7: Training Programs and Credentialing Requirements\nTLDR: Review training programs for health psychologists globally.\n- Overview of credentialing requirements in different countries\n- Importance of continuing professional development"", ""Scene 8: Casual Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allow space for brief off-topic discussions to strengthen team rapport.\n- Encourage participants to share non-work-related updates or interests\n- Foster a relaxed atmosphere with light-hearted conversation"", ""Scene 9: Wrap-Up and Next Steps\nTLDR: Conclude the meeting with final thoughts and future plans.\n- Summarize key points discussed during the meeting\n- Set tentative plans for next catch-up session or follow-up actions""]",">>Health Psychologist: Well, um, it's great to see everyone here! How's everyone doing today?
>>Medical Doctor: Hi everyone! It's good to see you all. I'm doing well, thanks.
>>Public Health Specialist: Hey folks! Nice to see you all again. Ready to dive into today's agenda? 
 >>Health Psychologist: So, health psychology is fascinating because it looks at how our thoughts, behaviors, and social environment impact our physical health. It's important to consider the biopsychosocial approach, which integrates biological, psychological, and social factors. For example, stress can affect our immune system just as much as a virus can.

>>Medical Doctor: Absolutely! It's really important to look at stress and social support when managing chronic illnesses like diabetes. In my practice, I've seen patients with chronic pain benefit greatly from cognitive-behavioral therapy.

>>Public Health Specialist: Right! Public health campaigns that focus on mental well-being can make a big difference. Integrating these strategies more broadly could really amplify health outcomes across communities.

>>Health Psychologist: Exactly! Health psychologists work in hospitals to help patients manage chronic illnesses by addressing their mental and emotional well-being alongside their physical health. They also collaborate with public health departments to design programs that promote healthier lifestyles at a community level.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: That's a great point about community programs! And don't forget workplace wellness programs—they're another great example of applying these principles practically. Addressing mental and emotional well-being in employees can lead to better overall health outcomes and productivity.

>>Health Psychologist: Exactly! In various settings like hospitals or workplaces, addressing mental and emotional well-being is crucial for managing chronic illnesses effectively. What do you think about the role of health psychologists in preventive care? 
 >>Medical Doctor: You see, integrating psychological principles into patient care can really boost treatment outcomes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example, is effective in managing chronic pain and stress-related conditions like diabetes. In practice, we often notice better adherence to medical regimens when patients receive psychological support alongside their physical treatments.

>>Public Health Specialist: From a community perspective, it's crucial to think about how population-level interventions can make a big impact on public health. Implementing widespread health education campaigns about mental well-being can help reduce stigma and encourage people to seek support. What do you think about integrating these strategies into our current healthcare systems?

>>Health Psychologist: So, integrating the biopsychosocial model into healthcare systems can truly enhance patient outcomes. It's vital to consider how psychological and social factors—like stress and support networks—affect physical health. Patients with strong social support often recover faster and stick better to treatment plans.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—do you have any specific examples of cognitive-behavioral therapy being successfully integrated in clinical settings? I think it would be helpful for everyone.

>>Medical Doctor: Oh sure! We've seen cognitive-behavioral therapy successfully integrated in managing chronic pain and diabetes at our clinic, leading to better patient adherence.

>>Health Psychologist: Well, it's fascinating how these strategies can be adapted for workplace wellness programs, potentially improving employee health and productivity. Stress management techniques not only aid patients with chronic illnesses but also boost community health when included in public health campaigns.

 >>Medical Doctor: Integrating stress management techniques into workplace wellness programs can really enhance employee health and productivity. In my practice, cognitive-behavioral therapy has helped reduce absenteeism and improve job satisfaction among patients dealing with chronic pain.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: That's a great point about cognitive-behavioral therapy, Doctor! From an occupational health perspective, workplace interventions like mindfulness sessions before shifts have reduced stress and improved focus among employees. It's important to consider workplace dynamics when designing these programs.

>>Health Psychologist: I agree with both of you. Stress management techniques can be transformative. I've seen significant improvements in patients' well-being by integrating mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategies.

>>Public Health Specialist: Interesting insights! On a community level, population-wide interventions like stress management workshops have helped reduce overall stress levels and improve mental health outcomes. It's essential to consider the broader impact these programs can have on public health.

>>Health Psychologist: Absolutely, community-level approaches are vital. I've worked with groups where combining stress management techniques with social activities not only helped manage stress but also built stronger social connections.

>>Medical Doctor: You know, in clinical practice, regular mindfulness exercises have significantly improved patients' ability to manage stress and pain. It's fascinating how psychological interventions can complement medical treatments.

>>Public Health Specialist: That's interesting; we've seen similar results in our community programs. Organizing workshops on stress management in neighborhoods with high unemployment rates led people to form support groups and initiate local wellness activities.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: And speaking of workplaces, implementing these interventions can really transform employee well-being. Mindfulness sessions at companies with high-stress levels have resulted in employees feeling more focused and less stressed.

>>Health Psychologist: It’s clear that whether it's individual or community-based, these approaches make a difference. We should also look at measurable outcomes to understand their full impact better. 
 >>Medical Doctor: You know, it's really interesting how treating both mind and body together helps patients get better results. I recently read about a study where integrating psychological support with physical treatments for heart disease led to a significant drop in hospital readmissions.

>>Public Health Specialist: That's a great point! And when we look at it from a community perspective, there was this campaign in Sweden that combined mental health education with physical activity programs. It not only reduced stigma but also increased participation in local fitness classes.

>>Health Psychologist: Yeah, those examples are fascinating. From my angle, the biopsychosocial model really shines when you see patients sticking to their treatment plans because they feel supported mentally as well. Have any of you seen similar success stories?

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: Absolutely! In workplaces, it's not just about mindfulness sessions before shifts; it's about creating comprehensive wellness programs. For instance, some companies have started offering ergonomic assessments and mental health resources alongside regular stress management workshops.

>>Medical Doctor: That's crucial. Diverse research methods help us understand these interventions better. Randomized controlled trials give us solid data on outcomes, while longitudinal studies show long-term benefits. Have any of you come across recent findings that caught your attention?

>>Health Psychologist: Actually, qualitative research has been eye-opening for me lately. Hearing personal stories from individuals undergoing these treatments provides deep insights into their experiences and challenges.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: So true! Tailoring workplace interventions based on employee feedback can boost engagement and productivity across different sectors.

>>Health Psychologist: Exactly! But what do you think are the biggest challenges we might face when implementing these innovative approaches? Any thoughts on overcoming them? 
 >>Public Health Specialist: You know, from a community perspective, one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that interventions are accessible and culturally relevant. It's essential to consider the diverse needs of different populations. For example, smoking cessation programs have been successful when tailored to specific communities with targeted messaging and support systems.

>>Medical Doctor: Absolutely. Effective communication between doctors and patients can significantly enhance the success of health interventions. In clinical practice, personalized smoking cessation programs that incorporate both behavioral support and pharmacotherapy have shown higher success rates. How does this impact our approach to designing community-level interventions?

>>Health Psychologist: Right, it's important to consider the biopsychosocial approach when designing these interventions. By addressing not just the biological aspects of smoking cessation but also the psychological and social factors, we can create more comprehensive programs. For instance, incorporating stress management techniques and community support can significantly enhance success rates.

>>Public Health Specialist: Exactly! Integrating community support and stress management techniques can really boost effectiveness. We should also think about leveraging local resources like community centers to host workshops and support groups.

>>Health Psychologist: That's a great idea. Additionally, we could collaborate with local health professionals to provide expert guidance during these workshops.

>>Medical Doctor: Absolutely, using motivational interviewing in our workshops could really help people stay engaged.

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: I agree that workplace dynamics are important, but how do we ensure these techniques are effective across different types of workplaces?

>>Health Psychologist: Using self-efficacy as a tool is powerful because it helps people believe they can succeed. We could share success stories from past programs to inspire confidence.

>>Public Health Specialist: So true! Making these interventions sustainable and scalable is crucial too. Leveraging local resources like community centers for workshops is a great start, but what do you think about partnering with local businesses to provide incentives for healthier lifestyle choices?

>>Occupational Health Psychologist: Partnering with businesses sounds promising. It could be a way to reach more people effectively while also promoting healthier habits in various settings.

>>Health Psychologist: When people hear about others achieving their health goals in their own communities, it becomes incredibly motivating.

>>Medical Doctor: From my experience, integrating psychological principles into physical treatments has really improved patient outcomes. Comprehensive training definitely plays a role here.
>>Health Psychologist: Absolutely! In Australia, we focus heavily on understanding biological, psychological, and social factors through rigorous training—this helps us address diverse health issues effectively.
>>Public Health Specialist: That's interesting! In Canada, we emphasize population-level interventions which can significantly improve community mental health overall.
>>Occupational Health Psychologist: Right! And in the US, stress management techniques are a big part of our training—they're crucial for enhancing employee well-being at work. How do you see these techniques fitting into wellness programs?
>>Medical Doctor: I agree! Germany also has extensive theoretical and practical components in their training which enhances healthcare delivery overall. 
 >>Health Psychologist: You know, I've been getting into baking lately. Last weekend I baked my first sourdough bread! It's amazing how therapeutic it can be to create something from scratch and see the final product. Plus, it's a great way to share joy with others!
>>Public Health Specialist: Really? How did you get into that? I've been gardening a lot recently. Nurturing plants is so calming and rewarding. Although, those weeds are relentless sometimes!
>>Occupational Health Psychologist: Oh, I love that! Gardening sounds wonderful. I've been hiking more these days. Being out in nature really clears my mind and provides a sense of peace.
>>Medical Doctor: Hiking is fantastic! Actually, I've been exploring photography lately. Capturing moments and landscapes has been incredibly therapeutic for me. It's fascinating how focusing on the details can really help clear your mind.
>>Health Psychologist: Photography sounds amazing! Well, I've also started doing yoga regularly. Focusing on breath and movement really helps reduce stress and keep me flexible.
>>Public Health Specialist: Yoga is great for flexibility! Speaking of hobbies, I've been experimenting with cooking new recipes lately. Trying out different cuisines is both a creative outlet and a way to explore new cultures.
>>Occupational Health Psychologist: That sounds delicious! Speaking of creativity, I've taken up painting again. Focusing on colors and brush strokes is so calming and gives me a sense of accomplishment.
>>Medical Doctor: Painting must be so relaxing! By the way, instead of cooking, I've been learning how to play guitar lately. It's challenging but incredibly rewarding when you finally nail a song. 
 >>Public Health Specialist: We've covered a lot today! From adding stress management techniques to our wellness programs to discussing hobbies like baking and yoga. I think our next step should be outlining pilot programs with clear metrics to track their effectiveness.
>>Health Psychologist: Setting up pilot programs sounds great. How about we start small in a few selected workplaces?
>>Occupational Health Psychologist: Yeah, starting small makes sense. We can see how it works before expanding further.
>>Medical Doctor: Absolutely, but we need to make sure these programs fit each workplace's needs. Clear metrics will help us measure success accurately.
