Ontology,"Ontology is the philosophical study of being. It is traditionally understood as the subdiscipline of metaphysics focused on the most general features of reality. As one of the most fundamental concepts, being encompasses all of reality and every entity within it. To articulate the basic structure of being, ontology examines the commonalities among all things and investigates their classification into basic types, such as the categories of particulars and universals. Particulars are unique, non-repeatable entities, such as the person Socrates, whereas universals are general, repeatable entities, like the color green. Another distinction exists between concrete objects existing in space and time, such as a tree, and abstract objects existing outside space and time, like the number 7. Systems of categories aim to provide a comprehensive inventory of reality by employing categories such as substance, property, relation, state of affairs, and event.
Ontologists disagree regarding which entities exist at the most basic level. Platonic realism asserts that universals have objective existence, while conceptualism maintains that universals exist only in the mind, and nominalism denies their existence altogether. Similar disputes pertain to mathematical objects, unobservable objects assumed by scientific theories, and moral facts. Materialism posits that fundamentally only matter exists, whereas dualism asserts that mind and matter are independent principles. According to some ontologists, objective answers to ontological questions do not exist, with perspectives shaped by differing linguistic practices.
Ontology employs diverse methods of inquiry, including the analysis of concepts and experience, the use of intuitions and thought experiments, and the integration of findings from natural science. Formal ontology investigates the most abstract features of objects, while Applied ontology utilizes ontological theories and principles to study entities within specific domains. For example, social ontology examines basic concepts used in the social sciences. Applied ontology is particularly relevant to information and computer science, which develop conceptual frameworks of limited domains. These frameworks facilitate the structured storage of information, such as in a college database tracking academic activities. Ontology is also pertinent to the fields of logic, theology, and anthropology.
The origins of ontology lie in the ancient period with speculations about the nature of being and the source of the universe, including ancient Indian, Chinese, and Greek philosophy. In the modern period, philosophers conceived ontology as a distinct academic discipline and coined its name.


Definition
Ontology is the study of being. It is the branch of philosophy that investigates the nature of existence, the features all entities have in common, and how they are divided into basic categories of being. It aims to discover the foundational building blocks of the world and characterize reality as a whole in its most general aspects. In this regard, ontology contrasts with individual sciences like biology and astronomy, which restrict themselves to a limited domain of entities, such as living entities and celestial phenomena. In some contexts, the term ontology refers not to the general study of being but to a specific ontological theory within this discipline. It can also mean an inventory or a conceptual scheme of a particular domain, such as the ontology of genes. In this context, an inventory is a comprehensive list of elements. A conceptual scheme is a framework of the key concepts and their relationships.
Ontology is closely related to metaphysics but the exact relation of these two disciplines is disputed. A traditionally influential characterization asserts that ontology is a subdiscipline of metaphysics. According to this view, metaphysics is the study of various aspects of fundamental reality, whereas ontology restricts itself to the most general features of reality. This view sees ontology as general metaphysics, which is to be distinguished from special metaphysics focused on more specific subject matters, like God, mind, and value. A different conception understands ontology as a preliminary discipline that provides a complete inventory of reality while metaphysics examines the features and structure of the entities in this inventory. Another conception says that metaphysics is about real being while ontology examines possible being or the concept of being. It is not universally accepted that there is a clear boundary between metaphysics and ontology. Some philosophers use both terms as synonyms.
The etymology of the word ontology traces back to the ancient Greek terms ὄντως (ontos, meaning 'being') and λογία (logia, meaning 'study of'), literally, 'the study of being'. The ancient Greeks did not use the term ontology, which was coined by philosophers in the 17th century.


Basic concepts


Being

Being, or existence, is the main topic of ontology. It is one of the most general and fundamental concepts, encompassing all of reality and every entity within it. In its broadest sense, being only contrasts with non-being or nothingness. It is controversial whether a more substantial analysis of the concept or meaning of being is possible. One proposal understands being as a property possessed by every entity. Critics argue that a thing without being cannot have properties. This means that properties presuppose being and cannot explain it. Another suggestion is that all beings share a set of essential features. According to the Eleatic principle, ""power is the mark of being"", meaning that only entities with causal influence truly exist. A controversial proposal by philosopher George Berkeley suggests that all existence is mental. He expressed this immaterialism in his slogan ""to be is to be perceived"".
Depending on the context, the term being is sometimes used with a more limited meaning to refer only to certain aspects of reality. In one sense, being is unchanging and permanent, in contrast to becoming, which implies change. Another contrast is between being, as what truly exists, and phenomena, as what appears to exist. In some contexts, being expresses the fact that something is while essence expresses its qualities or what it is like. 
Ontologists often divide being into fundamental classes or highest kinds, called categories of being. Proposed categories include substance, property, relation, state of affairs, and event. They can be used to provide systems of categories, which offer a comprehensive inventory of reality in which every entity belongs to exactly one category. Some philosophers, like Aristotle, say that entities belonging to different categories exist in distinct ways. Others, like John Duns Scotus, insist that there are no differences in the mode of being, meaning that everything exists in the same way. A related dispute is whether some entities have a higher degree of being than others, an idea already found in Plato's work. The more common view in contemporary philosophy is that a thing either exists or not with no intermediary states or degrees.
The relation between being and non-being is a frequent topic in ontology. Influential issues include the status of nonexistent objects and why there is something rather than nothing.


Particulars and universals

A central distinction in ontology is between particular and universal entities. Particulars, also called individuals, are unique, non-repeatable entities, like Socrates, the Taj Mahal, and Mars. Universals are general, repeatable entities, like the color green, the form circularity, and the virtue courage. Universals express aspects or features shared by particulars. For example, Mount Everest and Mount Fuji are particulars characterized by the universal mountain.
Universals can take the form of properties or relations. Properties describe the characteristics of things. They are features or qualities possessed by an entity. Properties are often divided into essential and accidental properties. A property is essential if an entity must have it; it is accidental if the entity can exist without it. For instance, having three sides is an essential property of a triangle, whereas being red is an accidental property. Relations are ways how two or more entities stand to one another. Unlike properties, they apply to several entities and characterize them as a group. For example, being a city is a property while being east of is a relation, as in ""Kathmandu is a city"" and ""Kathmandu is east of New Delhi"". Relations are often divided into internal and external relations. Internal relations depend only on the properties of the objects they connect, like the relation of resemblance. External relations express characteristics that go beyond what the connected objects are like, such as spatial relations.
Substances play an important role in the history of ontology as the particular entities that underlie and support properties and relations. They are often considered the fundamental building blocks of reality that can exist on their own, while entities like properties and relations cannot exist without substances. Substances persist through changes as they acquire or lose properties. For example, when a tomato ripens, it loses the property green and acquires the property red.
States of affairs are complex particular entities that have several other entities as their components. The state of affairs ""Socrates is wise"" has two components: the individual Socrates and the property wise. States of affairs that correspond to reality are called facts. Facts are truthmakers of statements, meaning that whether a statement is true or false depends on the underlying facts.
Events are particular entities that occur in time, like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first moon landing. They usually involve some kind of change, like the lawn becoming dry. In some cases, no change occurs, like the lawn staying wet. Complex events, also called processes, are composed of a sequence of events.


Concrete and abstract objects

Concrete objects are entities that exist in space and time, such as a tree, a car, and a planet. They have causal powers and can affect each other, like when a car hits a tree and both are deformed in the process. Abstract objects, by contrast, are outside space and time, such as the number 7 and the set of integers. They lack causal powers and do not undergo changes. The existence and nature of abstract objects remain subjects of philosophical debate.
Concrete objects encountered in everyday life are complex entities composed of various parts. For example, a book is made up of two covers and the pages between them. Each of these components is itself constituted of smaller parts, like molecules, atoms, and elementary particles. Mereology studies the relation between parts and wholes. One position in mereology says that every collection of entities forms a whole. According to another view, this is only the case for collections that fulfill certain requirements, for instance, that the entities in the collection touch one another. The problem of material constitution asks whether or in what sense a whole should be considered a new object in addition to the collection of parts composing it.
Abstract objects are closely related to fictional and intentional objects. Fictional objects are entities invented in works of fiction. They can be things, like the One Ring in J. R. R. Tolkien's book series The Lord of the Rings, and people, like the Monkey King in the novel Journey to the West. Some philosophers say that fictional objects are abstract objects and exist outside space and time. Others understand them as artifacts that are created as the works of fiction are written. Intentional objects are entities that exist within mental states, like perceptions, beliefs, and desires. For example, if a person thinks about the Loch Ness Monster then the Loch Ness Monster is the intentional object of this thought. People can think about existing and non-existing objects. This makes it difficult to assess the ontological status of intentional objects.


Other concepts
Ontological dependence is a relation between entities. An entity depends ontologically on another entity if the first entity cannot exist without the second entity. For instance, the surface of an apple cannot exist without the apple. An entity is ontologically independent if it does not depend on anything else, meaning that it is fundamental and can exist on its own. Ontological dependence plays a central role in ontology and its attempt to describe reality on its most fundamental level. It is closely related to metaphysical grounding, which is the relation between a ground and the facts it explains.

An ontological commitment of a person or a theory is an entity that exists according to them. For instance, a person who believes in God has an ontological commitment to God. Ontological commitments can be used to analyze which ontologies people explicitly defend or implicitly assume. They play a central role in contemporary metaphysics when trying to decide between competing theories. For example, the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument defends mathematical Platonism, asserting that numbers exist because the best scientific theories are ontologically committed to numbers.
Possibility and necessity are further topics in ontology. Possibility describes what can be the case, as in ""it is possible that extraterrestrial life exists"". Necessity describes what must be the case, as in ""it is necessary that three plus two equals five"". Possibility and necessity contrast with actuality, which describes what is the case, as in ""Doha is the capital of Qatar"". Ontologists often use the concept of possible worlds to analyze possibility and necessity. A possible world is a complete and consistent way how things could have been. For example, Haruki Murakami was born in 1949 in the actual world but there are possible worlds in which he was born at a different date. Using this idea, possible world semantics says that a sentence is possibly true if it is true in at least one possible world. A sentence is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds. The field of modal logic provides a precise formalization of the concepts of possibility and necessity.
In ontology, identity means that two things are the same. Philosophers distinguish between qualitative and numerical identity. Two entities are qualitatively identical if they have exactly the same features, such as perfect identical twins. This is also called exact similarity and indiscernibility. Numerical identity, by contrast, means that there is only a single entity. For example, if Fatima is the mother of Leila and Hugo then Leila's mother is numerically identical to Hugo's mother. Another distinction is between synchronic and diachronic identity. Synchronic identity relates an entity to itself at the same time. Diachronic identity relates an entity to itself at different times, as in ""the woman who bore Leila three years ago is the same woman who bore Hugo this year"". The notion of identity also has a number of philosophical implications in terms of how it interacts with the aforementioned necessity and possibility. Most famously, Saul Kripke contended that discovered identities such as ""Water is H2O"" are necessarily true because ""H2O"" is what's known as a rigid designator. 


Branches
There are different and sometimes overlapping ways to divide ontology into branches. Pure ontology focuses on the most abstract topics associated with the concept and nature of being. It is not restricted to a specific domain of entities and studies existence and the structure of reality as a whole. Pure ontology contrasts with applied ontology, also called domain ontology. Applied ontology examines the application of ontological theories and principles to specific disciplines and domains, often in the field of science. It considers ontological problems in regard to specific entities such as matter, mind, numbers, God, and cultural artifacts.
Social ontology, a major subfield of applied ontology, studies social kinds, like money, gender, society, and language. It aims to determine the nature and essential features of these concepts while also examining their mode of existence. According to a common view, social kinds are useful constructions to describe the complexities of social life. This means that they are not pure fictions but, at the same time, lack the objective or mind-independent reality of natural phenomena like elementary particles, lions, and stars. In the fields of computer science, information science, and knowledge representation, applied ontology is interested in the development of formal frameworks to encode and store information about a limited domain of entities in a structured way. A related application in genetics is Gene Ontology, which is a comprehensive framework for the standardized representation of gene-related information across species and databases.
Formal ontology is the study of objects in general while focusing on their abstract structures and features. It divides objects into different categories based on the forms they exemplify. Formal ontologists often rely on the tools of formal logic to express their findings in an abstract and general manner. Formal ontology contrasts with material ontology, which distinguishes between different areas of objects and examines the features characteristic of a specific area. Examples are ideal spatial beings in the area of geometry and living beings in the area of biology.
Descriptive ontology aims to articulate the conceptual scheme underlying how people ordinarily think about the world. Prescriptive ontology departs from common conceptions of the structure of reality and seeks to formulate a new and better conceptualization.
Another contrast is between analytic and speculative ontology. Analytic ontology examines the types and categories of being to determine what kinds of things could exist and what features they would have. Speculative ontology aims to determine which entities actually exist, for example, whether there are numbers or whether time is an illusion.

Metaontology studies the underlying concepts, assumptions, and methods of ontology. Unlike other forms of ontology, it does not ask ""what exists"" but ""what does it mean for something to exist"" and ""how can people determine what exists"". It is closely related to fundamental ontology, an approach developed by philosopher Martin Heidegger that seeks to uncover the meaning of being.


Schools of thought


Realism and anti-realism

The term realism is used for various theories that affirm that some kind of phenomenon is real or has mind-independent existence. Ontological realism is the view that there are objective facts about what exists and what the nature and categories of being are. Ontological realists do not make claims about what those facts are, for example, whether elementary particles exist. They merely state that there are mind-independent facts that determine which ontological theories are true. This idea is denied by ontological anti-realists, also called ontological deflationists, who say that there are no substantive facts one way or the other. According to philosopher Rudolf Carnap, for example, ontological statements are relative to language and depend on the ontological framework of the speaker. This means that there are no framework-independent ontological facts since different frameworks provide different views while there is no objectively right or wrong framework.

In a more narrow sense, realism refers to the existence of certain types of entities. Realists about universals say that universals have mind-independent existence. According to Platonic realists, universals exist not only independent of the mind but also independent of particular objects that exemplify them. This means that the universal red could exist by itself even if there were no red objects in the world. Aristotelian realism, also called moderate realism, rejects this idea and says that universals only exist as long as there are objects that exemplify them. Conceptualism, by contrast, is a form of anti-realism, stating that universals only exist in the mind as concepts that people use to understand and categorize the world. Nominalists defend a strong form of anti-realism by saying that universals have no existence. This means that the world is entirely composed of particular objects.
Mathematical realism, a closely related view in the philosophy of mathematics, says that mathematical facts exist independently of human language, thought, and practices and are discovered rather than invented. According to mathematical Platonism, this is the case because of the existence of mathematical objects, like numbers and sets. Mathematical Platonists say that mathematical objects are as real as physical objects, like atoms and stars, even though they are not accessible to empirical observation. Influential forms of mathematical anti-realism include conventionalism, which says that mathematical theories are trivially true simply by how mathematical terms are defined, and game formalism, which understands mathematics not as a theory of reality but as a game governed by rules of string manipulation.
Modal realism is the theory that in addition to the actual world, there are countless possible worlds as real and concrete as the actual world. The primary difference is that the actual world is inhabited by us while other possible worlds are inhabited by our counterparts. Modal anti-realists reject this view and argue that possible worlds do not have concrete reality but exist in a different sense, for example, as abstract or fictional objects.
Scientific realists say that the scientific description of the world is an accurate representation of reality. It is of particular relevance in regard to things that cannot be directly observed by humans but are assumed to exist by scientific theories, like electrons, forces, and laws of nature. Scientific anti-realism says that scientific theories are not descriptions of reality but instruments to predict observations and the outcomes of experiments.
Moral realists claim that there exist mind-independent moral facts. According to them, there are objective principles that determine which behavior is morally right. Moral anti-realists either claim that moral principles are subjective and differ between persons and cultures, a position known as moral relativism, or outright deny the existence of moral facts, a view referred to as moral nihilism.


By number of categories
Monocategorical theories say that there is only one fundamental category, meaning that every single entity belongs to the same universal class. For example, some forms of nominalism state that only concrete particulars exist while some forms of bundle theory state that only properties exist. Polycategorical theories, by contrast, hold that there is more than one basic category, meaning that entities are divided into two or more fundamental classes. They take the form of systems of categories, which list the highest genera of being to provide a comprehensive inventory of everything.
The closely related discussion between monism and dualism is about the most fundamental types that make up reality. According to monism, there is only one kind of thing or substance on the most basic level. Materialism is an influential monist view; it says that everything is material. This means that mental phenomena, such as beliefs, emotions, and consciousness, either do not exist or exist as aspects of matter, like brain states. Idealists take the converse perspective, arguing that everything is mental. They may understand physical phenomena, like rocks, trees, and planets, as ideas or perceptions of conscious minds. Neutral monism occupies a middle ground by saying that both mind and matter are derivative phenomena. Dualists state that mind and matter exist as independent principles, either as distinct substances or different types of properties. In a slightly different sense, monism contrasts with pluralism as a view not about the number of basic types but the number of entities. In this sense, monism is the controversial position that only a single all-encompassing entity exists in all of reality. Pluralism is more commonly accepted and says that several distinct entities exist.


By fundamental categories
The historically influential substance-attribute ontology is a polycategorical theory. It says that reality is at its most fundamental level made up of unanalyzable substances that are characterized by universals, such as the properties an individual substance has or relations that exist between substances. The closely related to substratum theory says that each concrete object is made up of properties and a substratum. The difference is that the substratum is not characterized by properties: it is a featureless or bare particular that merely supports the properties.
Various alternative ontological theories have been proposed that deny the role of substances as the foundational building blocks of reality. Stuff ontologies say that the world is not populated by distinct entities but by continuous stuff that fills space. This stuff may take various forms and is often conceived as infinitely divisible. According to process ontology, processes or events are the fundamental entities. This view usually emphasizes that nothing in reality is static, meaning that being is dynamic and characterized by constant change. Bundle theories state that there are no regular objects but only bundles of co-present properties. For example, a lemon may be understood as a bundle that includes the properties yellow, sour, and round. According to traditional bundle theory, the bundled properties are universals, meaning that the same property may belong to several different bundles. According to trope bundle theory, properties are particular entities that belong to a single bundle.
Some ontologies focus not on distinct objects but on interrelatedness. According to relationalism, all of reality is relational at its most fundamental level. Ontic structural realism agrees with this basic idea and focuses on how these relations form complex structures. Some structural realists state that there is nothing but relations, meaning that individual objects do not exist. Others say that individual objects exist but depend on the structures in which they participate. Fact ontologies present a different approach by focusing on how entities belonging to different categories come together to constitute the world. Facts, also known as states of affairs, are complex entities; for example, the fact that the Earth is a planet consists of the particular object the Earth and the property being a planet. Fact ontologies state that facts are the fundamental constituents of reality, meaning that objects, properties, and relations cannot exist on their own and only form part of reality to the extent that they participate in facts.
In the history of philosophy, various ontological theories based on several fundamental categories have been proposed. One of the first theories of categories was suggested by Aristotle, whose system includes ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, date, posture, state, action, and passion. An early influential system of categories in Indian philosophy, first proposed in the Vaisheshika school, distinguishes between six categories: substance, quality, motion, universal, individuator, and inherence. Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism includes a system of twelve categories, which Kant saw as pure concepts of understanding. They are subdivided into four classes: quantity, quality, relation, and modality. In more recent philosophy, theories of categories were developed by C. S. Peirce, Edmund Husserl, Samuel Alexander, Roderick Chisholm, and E. J. Lowe.


Others
The dispute between constituent and relational ontologies concerns the internal structure of concrete particular objects. Constituent ontologies say that objects have an internal structure with properties as their component parts. Bundle theories are an example of this position: they state that objects are bundles of properties. This view is rejected by relational ontologies, which say that objects have no internal structure, meaning that properties do not inhere in them but are externally related to them. According to one analogy, objects are like pin-cushions and properties are pins that can be stuck to objects and removed again without becoming a real part of objects. Relational ontologies are common in certain forms of nominalism that reject the existence of universal properties.
Hierarchical ontologies state that the world is organized into levels. Entities on all levels are real but low-level entities are more fundamental than high-level entities. This means that they can exist without high-level entities while high-level entities cannot exist without low-level entities. One hierarchical ontology says that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects they compose, like chairs and tables. Other hierarchical theories assert that substances are more fundamental than their properties and that nature is more fundamental than culture. Flat ontologies, by contrast, deny that any entity has a privileged status, meaning that all entities exist on the same level. For them, the main question is only whether something exists rather than identifying the level at which it exists.
The ontological theories of endurantism and perdurantism aim to explain how material objects persist through time. Endurantism is the view that material objects are three-dimensional entities that travel through time while being fully present in each moment. They remain the same even when they gain or lose properties as they change. Perdurantism is the view that material objects are four-dimensional entities that extend not just through space but also through time. This means that they are composed of temporal parts and, at any moment, only one part of them is present but not the others. According to perdurantists, change means that an earlier part exhibits different qualities than a later part. When a tree loses its leaves, for instance, there is an earlier temporal part with leaves and a later temporal part without leaves.
Differential ontology is a poststructuralist approach interested in the relation between the concepts of identity and difference. It says that traditional ontology sees identity as the more basic term by first characterizing things in terms of their essential features and then elaborating differences based on this conception. Differential ontologists, by contrast, privilege difference and say that the identity of a thing is a secondary determination that depends on how this thing differs from other things.
Object-oriented ontology belongs to the school of speculative realism and examines the nature and role of objects. It sees objects as the fundamental building blocks of reality. As a flat ontology, it denies that some entities have a more fundamental form of existence than others. It uses this idea to argue that objects exist independently of human thought and perception.


Methods
Methods of ontology are ways of conducting ontological inquiry and deciding between competing theories. There is no single standard method; the diverse approaches are studied by metaontology.
Conceptual analysis is a method to understand ontological concepts and clarify their meaning. It proceeds by analyzing their component parts and the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a concept applies to an entity. This information can help ontologists decide whether a certain type of entity, such as numbers, exists. Eidetic variation is a related method in phenomenological ontology that aims to identify the essential features of different types of objects. Phenomenologists start by imagining an example of the investigated type. They proceed by varying the imagined features to determine which ones cannot be changed, meaning they are essential. The transcendental method begins with a simple observation that a certain entity exists. In the following step, it studies the ontological repercussions of this observation by examining how it is possible or which conditions are required for this entity to exist.
Another approach is based on intuitions in the form of non-inferential impressions about the correctness of general principles. These principles can be used as the foundation on which an ontological system is built and expanded using deductive reasoning. A further intuition-based method relies on thought experiments to evoke new intuitions. This happens by imagining a situation relevant to an ontological issue and then employing counterfactual thinking to assess the consequences of this situation. For example, some ontologists examine the relation between mind and matter by imagining creatures identical to humans but without consciousness.
Naturalistic methods rely on the insights of the natural sciences to determine what exists. According to an influential approach by Willard Van Orman Quine, ontology can be conducted by analyzing the ontological commitments of scientific theories. This method is based on the idea that scientific theories provide the most reliable description of reality and that their power can be harnessed by investigating the ontological assumptions underlying them.

Principles of theory choice offer guidelines for assessing the advantages and disadvantages of ontological theories rather than guiding their construction. The principle of Ockham's Razor says that simple theories are preferable. A theory can be simple in different respects, for example, by using very few basic types or by describing the world with a small number of fundamental entities. Ontologists are also interested in the explanatory power of theories and give preference to theories that can explain many observations. A further factor is how close a theory is to common sense. Some ontologists use this principle as an argument against theories that are very different from how ordinary people think about the issue.
In applied ontology, ontological engineering is the process of creating and refining conceptual models of specific domains. Developing a new ontology from scratch involves various preparatory steps, such as delineating the scope of the domain one intends to model and specifying the purpose and use cases of the ontology. Once the foundational concepts within the area have been identified, ontology engineers proceed by defining them and characterizing the relations between them. This is usually done in a formal language to ensure precision and, in some cases, automatic computability. In the following review phase, the validity of the ontology is assessed using test data. Various more specific instructions for how to carry out the different steps have been suggested. They include the Cyc method, Grüninger and Fox's methodology, and so-called METHONTOLOGY. In some cases, it is feasible to adapt a pre-existing ontology to fit a specific domain and purpose rather than creating a new one from scratch.


Related fields
Ontology overlaps with many disciplines, including logic, the study of correct reasoning. Ontologists often employ logical systems to express their insights, specifically in the field of formal ontology. Of particular interest to them is the existential quantifier (
  
    
      
        ∃
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exists }
  
), which is used to express what exists. In first-order logic, for example, the formula 
  
    
      
        ∃
        x
        
          Dog
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exists x{\text{Dog}}(x)}
  
 states that dogs exist. Some philosophers study ontology by examining the structure of thought and language, saying that they reflect the structure of being. Doubts about the accuracy of natural language have led some ontologists to seek a new formal language, termed ontologese, for a better representation of the fundamental structure of reality.

Ontologies are often used in information science to provide a conceptual scheme or inventory of a specific domain, making it possible to classify objects and formally represent information about them. This is of specific interest to computer science, which builds databases to store this information and defines computational processes to automatically transform and use it. For instance, to encode and store information about clients and employees in a database, an organization may use an ontology with categories such as person, company, address, and name. In some cases, it is necessary to exchange information belonging to different domains or to integrate databases using distinct ontologies. This can be achieved with the help of upper ontologies, which are not limited to one specific domain. They use general categories that apply to most or all domains, like Suggested Upper Merged Ontology and Basic Formal Ontology.
Similar applications of ontology are found in various fields seeking to manage extensive information within a structured framework. Protein Ontology is a formal framework for the standardized representation of protein-related entities and their relationships. Gene Ontology and Sequence Ontology serve a similar purpose in the field of genetics. Environment Ontology is a knowledge representation focused on ecosystems and environmental processes. Friend of a Friend provides a conceptual framework to represent relations between people and their interests and activities.
The topic of ontology has received increased attention in anthropology since the 1990s, sometimes termed the ""ontological turn"". This type of inquiry is focused on how people from different cultures experience and understand the nature of being. Specific interest has been given to the ontological outlook of Indigenous people and how it differs from a Western perspective. As an example of this contrast, it has been argued that various indigenous communities ascribe intentionality to non-human entities, like plants, forests, or rivers. This outlook is known as animism and is also found in Native American ontologies, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all living entities and the importance of balance and harmony with nature.
Ontology is closely related to theology and its interest in the existence of God as an ultimate entity. The ontological argument, first proposed by Anselm of Canterbury, attempts to prove the existence of the divine. It defines God as the greatest conceivable being. From this definition it concludes that God must exist since God would not be the greatest conceivable being if God lacked existence. Another overlap in the two disciplines is found in ontological theories that use God or an ultimate being as the foundational principle of reality. Heidegger criticized this approach, terming it ontotheology.


History

The roots of ontology in ancient philosophy are speculations about the nature of being and the source of the universe. Discussions of the essence of reality are found in the Upanishads, ancient Indian scriptures dating from as early as 700 BCE. They say that the universe has a divine foundation and discuss in what sense ultimate reality is one or many. Samkhya, the first orthodox school of Indian philosophy, formulated an atheist dualist ontology based on the Upanishads, identifying pure consciousness and matter as its two foundational principles. The later Vaisheshika school proposed a comprehensive system of categories. In ancient China, Laozi's (6th century BCE) Taoism examines the underlying order of the universe, known as Tao, and how this order is shaped by the interaction of two basic forces, yin and yang. The philosophical movement of Xuanxue emerged in the 3rd century CE and explored the relation between being and non-being.
Starting in the 6th century BCE, Presocratic philosophers in ancient Greece aimed to provide rational explanations of the universe. They suggested that a first principle, such as water or fire, is the primal source of all things. Parmenides (c. 515–450 BCE) is sometimes considered the founder of ontology because of his explicit discussion of the concepts of being and non-being. Inspired by Presocratic philosophy, Plato (427–347 BCE) developed his theory of forms. It distinguishes between unchangeable perfect forms and matter, which has a lower degree of existence and imitates the forms. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) suggested an elaborate system of categories that introduced the concept of substance as the primary kind of being. The school of Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and proposed an ineffable source of everything, called the One, which is more basic than being itself.
The problem of universals was an influential topic in medieval ontology. Boethius (477–524 CE) suggested that universals can exist not only in matter but also in the mind. This view inspired Peter Abelard (1079–1142 CE), who proposed that universals exist only in the mind. Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274 CE) developed and refined fundamental ontological distinctions, such as the contrast between existence and essence, between substance and accidents, and between matter and form. He also discussed the transcendentals, which are the most general properties or modes of being. John Duns Scotus (1266–1308) argued that all entities, including God, exist in the same way and that each entity has a unique essence, called haecceity. William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347 CE) proposed that one can decide between competing ontological theories by assessing which one uses the smallest number of elements, a principle known as Ockham's razor.

In Arabic-Persian philosophy, Avicenna (980–1037 CE) combined ontology with theology. He identified God as a necessary being that is the source of everything else, which only has contingent existence. In 8th-century Indian philosophy, the school of Advaita Vedanta emerged. It says that only a single all-encompassing entity exists, stating that the impression of a plurality of distinct entities is an illusion. Starting in the 13th century CE, the Navya-Nyāya school built on Vaisheshika ontology with a particular focus on the problem of non-existence and negation. 9th-century China saw the emergence of Neo-Confucianism, which developed the idea that a rational principle, known as li, is the ground of being and order of the cosmos.
René Descartes (1596–1650) formulated a dualist ontology at the beginning of the modern period. It distinguishes between mind and matter as distinct substances that causally interact. Rejecting Descartes's dualism, Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) proposed a monist ontology according to which there is only a single entity that is identical to God and nature. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), by contrast, said that the universe is made up of many simple substances, which are synchronized but do not interact with one another. John Locke (1632–1704) proposed his substratum theory, which says that each object has a featureless substratum that supports the object's properties.  Christian Wolff (1679–1754) was influential in establishing ontology as a distinct discipline, delimiting its scope from other forms of metaphysical inquiry. George Berkeley (1685–1753) developed an idealist ontology according to which material objects are ideas perceived by minds.
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) rejected the idea that humans can have direct knowledge of independently existing things and their nature, limiting knowledge to the field of appearances. For Kant, ontology does not study external things but provides a system of pure concepts of understanding. Influenced by Kant's philosophy, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) linked ontology and logic. He said that being and thought are identical and examined their foundational structures. Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) rejected Hegel's philosophy and proposed that the world is an expression of a blind and irrational will. Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924) saw absolute spirit as the ultimate and all-encompassing reality while denying that there are any external relations. In Indian philosophy, Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) expanded on Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence. Sri Aurobindo (1872–1950) sought to understand the world as an evolutionary manifestation of a divine consciousness.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) developed phenomenology and employed its method, the description of experience, to address ontological problems. This idea inspired his student Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) to clarify the meaning of being by exploring the mode of human existence. Jean-Paul Sartre responded to Heidegger's philosophy by examining the relation between being and nothingness from the perspective of human existence, freedom, and consciousness. Based on the phenomenological method, Nicolai Hartmann (1882–1950) developed a complex hierarchical ontology that divides reality into four levels: inanimate, biological, psychological, and spiritual.

Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) articulated a controversial ontological theory that includes nonexistent objects as part of being. Arguing against this theory, Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) formulated a fact ontology known as logical atomism. This idea was further refined by the early Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) and inspired D. M. Armstrong's (1926–2014) ontology. Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), by contrast, developed a process ontology. Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) questioned the objectivity of ontological theories by claiming that what exists depends on one's linguistic framework. He had a strong influence on Willard Van Orman Quine (1908–2000), who analyzed the ontological commitments of scientific theories to solve ontological problems. Quine's student David Lewis (1941–2001) formulated the position of modal realism, which says that possible worlds are as real and concrete as the actual world. Since the end of the 20th century, interest in applied ontology has risen in computer and information science with the development of conceptual frameworks for specific domains.

Hope you're all doing well today. So, let's dive into our brainstorming session. Our main goal is to explore practical applications of ontological theories in information science. Feel free to jump in with any ideas or questions!

>>Philosopher: Let's consider how our understanding of being can help us categorize information effectively. How do we classify and understand the myriad entities that populate our reality?

>>Historian of Philosophy: Building on what was said, how can historical perspectives inform our current data categorization methods? For instance, Plato's forms were influenced by Socrates and ancient Greece's intellectual environment. How might these inform our current exploration?

>>Cognitive Scientist: Understanding complex philosophical concepts requires us to consider how our cognitive processes handle abstract ideas. Let's explore how our brains categorize complex data sets using ontological frameworks.

>>Linguist: In linguistic terms, semantics are crucial for understanding how we categorize and interpret entities. How can semantic analysis improve our database search algorithms?

>>Philosopher: How can distinguishing between particulars and universals help us organize data more efficiently? Are these categories mere constructs or do they possess inherent reality beyond our frameworks?

>>Computer Scientist: Considering what we've discussed about cognitive processing and historical context, applied ontology could streamline information management in ways that reflect these complexities. Think about a college database tracking academic activities—when organized ontologically, it enhances data processing efficiency.

>>Historian of Philosophy: Given Plato's influence, how might his concept of forms be used to structure modern databases? Reflecting on history's context can provide valuable insights for contemporary applications.

>>Cognitive Scientist: It's intriguing how cognitive processes handle abstract concepts like universals and particulars without getting lost in complexity. Let's delve deeper into specific examples relevant to information science.

>>Linguist: Can we use semantic networks to enhance data retrieval accuracy? By analyzing semantics further, we can ensure that language accurately reflects the complexities of being and existence. 
 >>Philosopher: So, when we talk about particulars and universals, we're really diving into the basics of how we understand existence. Think of Socrates or the Taj Mahal as unique entities—particulars. Universals, like courage or the color green, are concepts that can pop up in many different places. It's a way to make sense of everything around us.
>>Historian of Philosophy: Right, and this debate has been around forever! Aristotle gave us categories that shaped philosophical thought for centuries, while Plato had his own take with forms. But what does all this mean for us today? How do these ideas help us tackle modern philosophical questions?
>>Computer Scientist: That's a good point! In tech, understanding these distinctions is super useful. Like in AI systems—recognizing 'human' as a universal concept versus 'John Doe' as a particular helps in creating smarter algorithms.
>>Cognitive Scientist: Exactly! Our brains are wired to sort things out like this. When we see someone like Socrates, we automatically think 'human,' 'philosopher.' It’s how we simplify complex info into something manageable.
>>Philosopher: And ontology really makes us think about existence itself—
>>Linguist (jumping in): Sorry to cut you off there! You mentioned abstract objects earlier—how does language handle those compared to concrete ones?
>>Philosopher: Great question! Language uses proper nouns for specific things and common nouns or adjectives for abstract ideas. This helps get the message across clearly.
>>Linguist: Yeah, it's fascinating how language builds meaning. Proper nouns pinpoint particulars while common nouns cover universals—it’s crucial for understanding communication.
>>Historian of Philosophy: Looking back at history shows how these ideas have evolved and still influence today's debates. Take Aristotle's categories—they laid groundwork that's still relevant now in modern philosophy discussions.
>>Computer Scientist: Speaking of applications, think about AI categorization systems—they rely on distinguishing between concrete data points and abstract concepts to function effectively. 
 >>Historian of Philosophy: Aristotle's ideas have really influenced how we think about things like substance and property. His impact is still felt today in modern ontology. But what can history teach us about how these ideas have changed over time?

>>Philosopher: Absolutely, Aristotle's framework gives us a solid foundation for exploring existence. But we also need to consider the challenges posed by later philosophical thought. For instance, the debate between substance and process ontology raises interesting questions about whether reality is static or dynamic.

>>Computer Scientist: That's a great point! When we think about categories like substance and event, it's fascinating to see their practical applications in information science. Imagine structuring a database—substance could represent entities like users or products, while events might track interactions or transactions. How can we push this further?

>>Cognitive Scientist: Building on that, how do we process these categories cognitively? When faced with concepts like substance or event, our brains naturally categorize them based on prior knowledge and experience. Could this cognitive approach help us better understand the evolution of these philosophical ideas?

>>Philosopher: In the grand scheme of things, the evolution of ontological categories reflects our quest to understand reality's essence. Aristotle's substance-attribute ontology laid a foundation that has been both challenged and expanded by modern theories like process ontology. What implications does this have for our understanding of existence?

>>Linguist: From a linguistic perspective, categorizing concepts like substance and event profoundly influences our grasp of reality. As we delve into semantics, it's intriguing to see how language shapes these ontological categories—perhaps even redefining them over time.

>>Historian of Philosophy: As Aristotle said, 'Substance is that which exists in itself.' This notion has shaped our understanding throughout history as independent existences. However, modern theories like process ontology challenge this view by suggesting that reality is fundamentally dynamic.

>>Philosopher: Indeed! Process ontology challenges traditional views by positing that reality is dynamic rather than static. This shift suggests that our comprehension must accommodate constant change and transformation.

>>Computer Scientist: Practically speaking, these ontological categories are invaluable for structuring information systems—using substance for entities like users or products and events to track interactions can streamline data management.

>>Cognitive Scientist: Let's think about this... Our brains naturally seek to categorize concepts based on prior knowledge and experience when processing ideas like substance versus event.

>>Philosopher: If reality is indeed dynamic as posited by process ontology, then our understanding must shift from viewing entities as static substances to recognizing them as fluid processes.

>>Linguist: Analyzing semantics reveals how language not only reflects but also shapes our understanding of concepts like substance and event—especially considering the dynamic nature suggested by process ontology. 
 >>Cognitive Scientist: It's intriguing how our minds might interpret the separation of mind and matter naturally. How do we reconcile this with materialism's view?
>>Philosopher: Yes, dualism sees mind and matter as distinct, while materialism says only matter exists. What does this mean for consciousness?
>>Computer Scientist: Let's break it down... Dualism suggests that mind and matter are separate, which could imply that our cognitive processes might be influenced by non-material factors. On the other hand, materialism asserts that everything, including consciousness, is a result of physical processes. How can we apply these perspectives to improve our understanding of information categorization?
>>Linguist: In linguistic terms—
>>Historian of Philosophy (interrupting): Sorry, but how does language influence whether people lean towards dualism or materialism?
>>Linguist: Great point! The semantics of language play a crucial role in shaping our understanding and communication of these complex ideas. For instance, how do we linguistically differentiate between the abstract concepts of dualism and materialism? Our semantic frameworks can deeply influence how we categorize and interpret these ontological perspectives.
>>Historian of Philosophy: In history, we see that dualism and materialism have been debated extensively. Descartes' dualism posited a clear distinction between mind and matter, while Spinoza's monist view rejected this separation entirely. How do these historical perspectives influence our current understanding of consciousness?
>>Philosopher: Carnap suggests that ontological statements depend on language frameworks, meaning our understanding of existence might be shaped by linguistic practices.
>>Computer Scientist: Amazing! Anti-realism challenges objective facts about existence. How can we adapt our data structures to different linguistic practices based on this perspective?
>>(Participants nod thoughtfully)
>>Philosopher: Conceptualism offers a fascinating perspective. It posits that universals exist only within the mind, shaping our cognitive framework and influencing how we categorize information. This raises an intriguing question: How do our mental constructs impact our perception of reality?
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone pauses briefly)
>>(Phone stops ringing)
>>Computer Scientist: Well, that was unexpected! Anyway...
>>(Participants chuckle lightly)
>>(Conversation resumes)
>>Cognitive Scientist (smiling): As I was saying—our minds might naturally lean towards conceptualizing universals internally rather than externally. 
 >>Computer Scientist: Thought experiments are great for testing our ideas. How can we use them to improve our models practically?
>>Philosopher: Absolutely! They challenge our theories. But how do we keep things simple like Ockham's Razor suggests?
>>Historian of Philosophy: Galileo’s thought experiment changed physics forever. What can we learn from history about keeping our theories simple?
>>Cognitive Scientist: That's interesting! How does our brain handle these complex scenarios while trying to keep things simple?
>>Philosopher: Good question! Balancing simplicity with complexity is tricky.
>>Computer Scientist: Right, so how do we make sure our models stay practical and straightforward without losing depth?
>>Historian of Philosophy: Reflecting on historical context, um, we see that thought experiments have often been pivotal in challenging established paradigms. As Socrates once said, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' This sentiment echoes through our ontological explorations today, urging us to balance simplicity with complexity.
>>Linguist: Interesting point about simplicity! How do you think this applies to semantic frameworks?
>>Cognitive Scientist: You know, it's fascinating how our cognitive processes handle the complexity of thought experiments while striving for simplicity. How does our brain filter and integrate these abstract concepts into a coherent understanding? 
 >>Linguist: Applied ontology helps us categorize and store information using semantic frameworks, making our data structures precise and meaningful. This deeper context boosts retrieval accuracy and streamlines management.

>>Philosopher: Structuring data based on ontological principles mirrors real-world relationships, enhancing our understanding of both data organization and reality itself. How does this impact our perception?

>>Computer Scientist: Practically speaking, applied ontology organizes data meaningfully—like linking students to courses in a college database for intuitive retrieval. It makes everything so much easier to manage.

>>Historian of Philosophy: Historical principles like Aristotle’s categories have shaped knowledge structuring—similar to modern practices in applied ontology. What lessons can we draw from history?

>>Cognitive Scientist: Our brains seek patterns; applied ontology structures these meaningfully for better processing. How does this affect cognitive functions?

>>Philosopher: By reflecting real-world relationships in data structures, we're enhancing retrieval processes and redefining digital existence.

>>Computer Scientist: Applied ontology highlights entity relationships—like linking products to categories in e-commerce databases for efficient navigation.

>>Historian of Philosophy: Aristotle’s influence shows how ancient principles continue shaping modern practices—a timeless connection through ages.

>>Cognitive Scientist: Fascinating! Applied ontology provides structured patterns that aid cognitive processing effectively across various domains. 
 >>Historian of Philosophy: As we reflect on the historical development of ontological theories, it's crucial to consider the contributions from ancient Greek philosophy. Aristotle's categories have certainly influenced modern ontology. What are some practical applications you've seen in your field?
>>Philosopher: Absolutely, Aristotle's categories laid a foundation, but we must also consider ancient Indian philosophy. The concept of Brahman as an ultimate reality offers a profound perspective on substance and property. How do you think it compares to Aristotle's idea of substance?
>>Historian of Philosophy: That's an interesting point about Brahman. If we look at Chinese philosophy, Laozi's concept of Tao provides a unique perspective on the underlying order of the universe. Could we design algorithms that adapt dynamically to changing data patterns using this idea?
>>Computer Scientist: You know, breaking it down practically... Aristotle's categories can be directly applied to structuring data in modern databases. But integrating Laozi’s Tao into dynamic systems is intriguing—perhaps by creating adaptive algorithms that respond to real-time changes.
>>Cognitive Scientist: Hmm... Our brains are wired to seek patterns and order, which aligns with Laozi's idea of an underlying universal order. This could explain why such ancient insights resonate deeply in cognitive frameworks today.
>>Philosopher: In the grand scheme of things, um, we must also consider contributions from modern philosophers like Descartes and Kant. While I see the value in Descartes' dualism, I think it oversimplifies consciousness complexity as understood today.
>>Computer Scientist: Considering Descartes' dualism and Kant's transcendental idealism, you know, these ideas influence our current ontological frameworks significantly. Can you give an example of how Kant’s idealism might inform user interface design?
>>Historian of Philosophy: Reflecting on Kant’s transcendental idealism—our understanding shaped by mind structures—offers a profound perspective on perceiving existence. It could inform intuitive layouts based on common perceptual patterns.
>>Philosopher: Right! And again considering Brahman from ancient Indian philosophy—it offers a profound perspective on substance and property. How does this translate into modern semantics analysis?
>>Linguist: From a linguistic standpoint, Brahman acts as a semantic framework influencing substance-property understanding. It's fascinating how this translates into analyzing meaning structures within language today. 
 >>Philosopher: You know, the concept of Brahman as a universal entity offers profound insights into existence. It's like asking, ""To be or not to be?"" What is the essence that underlies all things? How do we distinguish between particulars and universals in our quest to understand reality?

>>Historian of Philosophy: Um, throughout history, this distinction has been central to philosophical inquiry. Aristotle's categories laid the groundwork for understanding these concepts in relation to substance and property. But what can we learn from history about how these ideas have evolved over time?

>>Computer Scientist: I mean, let's break it down... In practical terms, distinguishing between particulars and universals is super useful for organizing information in databases. Like when categorizing student records—each student is a particular, while their attributes like courses taken are universals. This approach helps streamline data retrieval.

>>Philosopher: This isn't just theory; it's about understanding how we see the world. How do we reconcile abstract entities like numbers with concrete objects such as trees? This question touches upon the essence of being.

>>Historian of Philosophy: You know, it's fascinating how these distinctions have shaped our understanding over centuries—from Aristotle's categories to modern debates on universals and particulars. Each era has contributed its own insights.

>>Cognitive Scientist: Hmm... In cognitive terms, how do we process these distinctions? Our brains naturally categorize information, but what mechanisms are at play when interpreting abstract concepts versus concrete objects?

>>Philosopher: The distinction between particulars and universals isn't just philosophical abstraction; it's a lens through which we perceive the world. Consider how this dichotomy influences identity and difference—how do we reconcile universal sameness with unique particularity?

>>Linguist: In linguistic terms, this distinction is crucial for understanding language's role in shaping perception. Proper nouns denote unique entities while common nouns represent universal concepts. For example, ""London"" refers to a specific city while ""city"" can refer to any urban area.

>>Philosopher: Contemplating existence involves considering particulars versus universals' interplay—how does courage manifest uniquely yet remain an abstract concept? This challenges our grasp on identity and difference.

>>Computer Scientist: That's interesting! Applying these distinctions practically can revolutionize domains like library databases—categorizing books under universal themes streamlines searches and enhances user experience.

>>Historian of Philosophy: Reflecting on historical evolution reveals Aristotle's influence beyond philosophy into fields like computer science. It's intriguing how ancient concepts continue shaping our reality today.

>>Cognitive Scientist: I hadn't thought about it that way before! Our brains juggle abstract universals alongside concrete particulars without getting overwhelmed—how do we interpret complex ideas intuitively? It's almost like walking a tightrope between two worlds. 
 >>Computer Scientist: Alright, let's break it down. We've discussed a lot of fascinating concepts today. How about we prioritize the idea of using applied ontology to streamline information management? It's practical and can be implemented in various systems!
>>Philosopher: I agree. Applied ontology seems like a promising direction. We should focus on integrating universals and particulars within data systems to make them more efficient.
>>Historian of Philosophy: Absolutely. Aristotle's ideas have influenced modern data systems; let's use that insight to guide our approach without getting too bogged down in historical details.
>>Cognitive Scientist: Good point about semantic networks! Let's discuss how we can implement them effectively to ensure our systems are adaptable as they evolve.
>>Linguist: Sorry to jump in here! Just wondering if anyone else thinks semantic networks could play a role here? They might help us map relationships between concepts more precisely.
>>Cognitive Scientist: Oh, definitely! Semantic networks are crucial for maintaining both theoretical depth and practical applicability. How do we ensure these structures remain adaptable?
>>Philosopher: Yes, adaptability is key. We need to make sure our approach can handle evolving complexities in data systems.
>>Historian of Philosophy: Reflecting on historical influences briefly, it's fascinating how ancient ideas continue to shape modern data systems. Let's use this legacy wisely to keep our approach robust and applicable."
