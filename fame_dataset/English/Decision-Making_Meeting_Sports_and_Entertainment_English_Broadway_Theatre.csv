Broadway Theatre,"

Broadway theatre,[nb 1] or Broadway, is a theater genre that consists of the theatrical performances presented in 41 professional theaters, each with 500 or more seats, in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[1][2] Broadway and London's West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English-speaking world.[3]

While the Broadway thoroughfare is eponymous with the district, it is closely identified with Times Square. Only three theaters are located on Broadway itself: the Broadway Theatre, Palace Theatre, and Winter Garden Theatre. The rest are located on the numbered cross streets, extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to 53rd Street, and Vivian Beaumont Theater, at Lincoln Center on West 65th Street. While exceptions exist, the term ""Broadway theatre"" is used predominantly to describe venues with seating capacities of at least 500 people. Smaller theaters in New York City are referred to as off-Broadway, regardless of location, while very small venues with fewer than 101 seats are called off-off-Broadway, a term that can also apply to non-commercial, avant-garde, or productions held outside of traditional theater venues.[4]

The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.54 billion worth of tickets in both the 2022–2023 and the 2023–2024 seasons. Both seasons featured theater attendance of approximately 12.3 million each.[5]

Most Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues that ""Broadway musicals, culminating in the productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture"" and contributed to making New York City the cultural capital of the world.[6]

New York City's first significant theatre was established in the mid-18th century, around 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan, which held about 280 people. They presented William Shakespeare's plays and ballad operas such as The Beggar's Opera.[7] In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia, and opened with The Merchant of Venice and The Anatomist. The company moved to New York in 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like Damon and Phillida.

During the Revolutionary War, theatre was suspended in New York City. But after the war's end, theatre resumed in 1798, when the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street on present-day Park Row.[7] A second major theatre, Bowery Theatre, opened in 1826,[8] followed by others.

By the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in Lower Manhattan. In 1829, at Broadway and Prince Street, Niblo's Garden opened and soon became one of New York's premier nightspots. The 3,000-seat theatre presented all sorts of musical and non-musical entertainments. In 1844, Palmo's Opera House opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton's Theatre. The Astor Opera House opened in 1847. A riot broke out in 1849 when the lower-class patrons of the Bowery Theatre objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper-class audiences at Astor Place: ""After the Astor Place Riot of 1849, entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines: opera was chiefly for the upper-middle and upper classes, minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle-class, variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle-class.""[9]

The plays of William Shakespeare were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period, most notably by American actor Edwin Booth who was internationally known for his performance as Hamlet. Booth played the role for a famous 100 consecutive performances at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1865 (with the run ending just a few months before Booth's brother John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and would later revive the role at his own Booth's Theatre (which was managed for a time by his brother Junius Brutus Booth Jr.). Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were Henry Irving, Tommaso Salvini, Fanny Davenport, and Charles Fechter.

Theatre in New York moved from Downtown gradually to Midtown Manhattan, beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the area that now comprises the Theater District was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms. In 1836, Mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened 42nd Street and invited Manhattanites to ""enjoy the pure clean air.""[10] Close to 60 years later, theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein I built the iconic Victoria Theater on West 42nd Street.[10]

Broadway's first ""long-run"" musical was a 50-performance hit called The Elves in 1857. In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in Union Square, and by the end of the century, many theatres were near Madison Square. Theatres arrived in the Times Square area in the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres consolidated there after a large number were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London,[11] but Laura Keene's ""musical burletta"" The Seven Sisters (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.

The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be The Black Crook, which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post was the first show to call itself a ""musical comedy"".[12]

Tony Pastor opened the first vaudeville theatre one block east of Union Square in 1881, where Lillian Russell performed. Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (The Mulligan Guard Picnic) and 1890, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form. They starred high-quality professional singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal, and Fay Templeton), instead of the amateurs, often sex workers, who had starred in earlier musical forms.

As transportation improved, poverty in New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during the latter half of the century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan's family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven's Robin Hood (1891) and John Philip Sousa's El Capitan (1896), along with operas, ballets, and other British and European hits.

Charles H. Hoyt's A Trip to Chinatown (1891) became Broadway's long-run champion when it surpassed Adonis and its 603 total performances in 1893, holding the stage for 657 performances. Chinatown itself was surpassed by the musical Irene (1919) in 1921 as the longest-running Broadway musical, and even earlier, in March 1920, by Lightnin' (1918) as the longest-running Broadway show. In 1896, theatre owners Marc Klaw and A. L. Erlanger formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the U.S. for the next sixteen years.[13] However, smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated, and Off-Broadway was well established by the end of the nineteenth century.

A Trip to Coontown (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre (inspired largely by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by the ragtime-tinged Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk (1898), and the highly successful In Dahomey (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s made up of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley involving composers such as Gus Edwards, John Walter Bratton, and George M. Cohan (Little Johnny Jones (1904), 45 Minutes From Broadway (1906), and George Washington Jr. (1906)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until World War I.[11]
A few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York, including Florodora in 1900–01.

In the early years of the twentieth century, translations of popular late-nineteenth century continental operettas were joined by the ""Princess Theatre"" shows of the 1910s, by writers such as P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Harry B. Smith. Victor Herbert, whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (The Fortune Teller (1898), Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906), and Naughty Marietta (1910)).[14]

Beginning with The Red Mill, Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres. Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly, white lights were used, and Broadway was nicknamed ""The Great White Way"". In August 1919, the Actors' Equity Association demanded a standard contract for all professional productions. After a strike shut down all the theatres, the producers were forced to agree. By the 1920s, the Shubert Brothers had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate.[15]

During this time, the play Lightnin' by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon became the first Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, it would go on to become the first show to reach 1,000 performances. Lightnin' was the longest-running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by Abie's Irish Rose in 1925.

The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like The Jazz Singer were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatres survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall, and other light entertainment, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs.

Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as Sally; Lady Be Good; Sunny; No, No, Nanette; Harlem; Oh, Kay!; and Funny Face. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Live theatre has survived the invention of cinema.


Leaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind and taking the drama a step forward, Show Boat premiered on December 27, 1927, at the Ziegfeld Theatre. It represented a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting, and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals. It ran for 572 performances.[16]
The 1920s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of Eugene O'Neill, whose plays Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape, Strange Interlude, and Mourning Becomes Electra proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O'Neill's success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Clifford Odets, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy like George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in Hamlet and Richard III, John Gielgud in Hamlet, The Importance of Being Earnest and Much Ado About Nothing, Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac, Paul Robeson and Ferrer in Othello, Maurice Evans in Richard II and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, and Candida.

In 1930, Theatre Guild's production of Roar, China! was Broadway's first play with a majority Asian cast.[17]

As World War II approached, a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non-intervention. The most successful was Lillian Hellman's Watch on the Rhine, which opened in April 1941.[18]

After the lean years of the Great Depression, Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit Oklahoma!, in 1943, which ran for 2,212 performances. According to John Kenrick's writings on Broadway musicals, ""Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts. Public demand, a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping. To this day, the shows of the 1950s form the core of the musical theatre repertory.""[19]

Kenrick notes that ""the late 1960s marked a time of cultural upheaval. All those changes would prove painful for many, including those behind the scenes, as well as those in the audience.""[20] Of the 1970s, Kenrick writes: ""Just when it seemed that traditional book musicals were back in style, the decade ended with critics and audiences giving mixed signals.""[21]

Ken Bloom observed that ""The 1960s and 1970s saw a worsening of the area [Times Square] and a drop in the number of legitimate shows produced on Broadway.""[22] By way of comparison, in the 1950 to 1951 season (May to May) 94 productions opened on Broadway; in the 1969 to 1970 season (June to May) there were 59 productions (fifteen were revivals).[23][24] In the twenties, there were 70–80 theaters, but by 1969, there were 36 left.[25]

During this time, many Broadway productions struggled due to low attendance rates, which resulted in perceived mediocrity among such plays. For this reason, the Theatre Development Fund was created with the purpose of assisting productions with high cultural value that likely would struggle without subsidization, by offering tickets to those plays to consumers at reduced prices.[26]

In early 1982, Joe Papp, the theatrical producer and director who established The Public Theater, led the ""Save the Theatres"" campaign.[27] It was a not-for-profit group supported by the Actors Equity union to save the theater buildings in the neighborhood from demolition by monied Manhattan development interests.[28][29][30][31] Papp provided resources, recruited a publicist and celebrated actors, and provided audio, lighting, and technical crews for the effort.[29]

At Papp's behest, in July 1982, a bill was introduced in the 97th Congress, entitled ""H.R.6885, A bill to designate the Broadway/Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site"".[32] The legislation would have provided certain U.S. government resources and assistance to help the city preserve the district.[32] Faced with strong opposition and lobbying by Mayor Ed Koch's Administration and corporate Manhattan development interests, the bill was not passed. The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts to supporting the establishment of the Theater District as a registered historic district.[33][34] In December 1983, Save the Theatres prepared ""The Broadway Theater District, a Preservation Development and Management Plan"", and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation.[34] Mayor Ed Koch ultimately reacted by creating a Theater Advisory Council, which included Papp.[29]

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Broadway theaters closed on March 12, 2020, shuttering 16 shows that were playing or were in the process of opening. The Broadway League shutdown was extended first to April, then to May, then June, then September 2020 and January 2021,[35] and later to June 1, 2021.[36] Then-governor Andrew Cuomo announced that most sectors of New York would have their restrictions lifted on May 19, 2021, but he stated that Broadway theatres would not be able to immediately resume performances on this date due to logistical reasons. In May 2021, Cuomo announced that Broadway theaters would be allowed to reopen on September 14, and the League confirmed that performances would begin to resume in the fall season.[37]

Springsteen on Broadway became the first full-length show to resume performances, opening on June 26, 2021, to 1,721 vaccinated patrons at the St. James Theatre.[38] Pass Over then had its first preview on August 4, and opened on August 22, 2021, becoming the first new play to open.[39][40] Hadestown and Waitress were the first musicals to resume performances on September 2, 2021.[41] The 74th Tony Awards were also postponed; the Tony nominations were announced on October 15, 2020,[42] and took place on September 26, 2021.[43] On July 30, 2021, it was announced that all Broadway theaters required attendees to provide proof of full COVID-19 vaccination. The rule applied to guests ages 12+. Those under age 12 were required to provide a negative COVID-19 test (PCR within 72 hours or antigen within six hours of the performance start time). Beginning November 8, those ages 5–11 also had the option to provide proof of at least one vaccination shot. Effective December 14, in accordance with NYC's vaccination mandate, guests ages 5–11 were required to have at least one vaccination shot until January 29, 2022, where they had to be fully vaccinated.[44] The vaccine mandate lasted until April 30,[45][46] and attendees were also required to wear face masks until July 1.[47]

During the COVID-19 shutdown, the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, and Jujamcyn had pledged to increase racial and cultural diversity in their theaters, including naming at least one theater for a Black theatrical personality.[48] The August Wilson Theatre, owned by Jujamcyn, had been renamed after Black playwright August Wilson in 2005.[49] The Shuberts announced in March 2022 that the Cort Theatre, which was under renovation at the time, would be renamed after actor James Earl Jones.[50][51] In June 2022, the Nederlanders announced that the Brooks Atkinson Theatre would be renamed after Lena Horne,[52][53][49] The James Earl Jones Theatre was rededicated in September 2022,[54] while the Lena Horne Theatre was rededicated that November.[55]

Although there are some exceptions, shows with open-ended runs generally have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday, with a 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. ""curtain"". The afternoon ""matinée"" performances are at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at 3:00 p.m. on Sundays. This makes for an eight-performance week. On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be ""dark"" on that day.[56][57] The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.

In recent years, some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to 7:00 pm.[56] The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek, Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons. The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those Disney produces, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.

Most Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of The Broadway League (formerly ""The League of American Theatres and Producers""), a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole, negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds, and co-administers the Tony Awards with the American Theatre Wing, a service organization. While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated, they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York.

Of the four non-profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres, all four (Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theatre Club, Roundabout Theatre Company, and Second Stage Theatre) belong to the League of Resident Theatres and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers. (Disney also negotiates apart from the League, as did Livent before it closed down its operations.)

The majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations: the Shubert Organization, a for-profit arm of the non-profit Shubert Foundation, which owns seventeen theatres; the Nederlander Organization, which controls nine theatres; and ATG Entertainment, which owns seven Broadway houses.

Both musicals and straight plays on Broadway often rely on casting well-known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre. Actors from film and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast. There are still, however, performers who are primarily stage actors, spending most of their time ""on the boards"", and appearing in screen roles only secondarily. As Patrick Healy of The New York Times noted:

Broadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year, as Nathan Lane has for The Addams Family. In 2010, some theater heavyweights like Mr. Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had to move on to other commitments.[58]
According to Mark Shenton, ""One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape—on both sides of the Atlantic—over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has [sic] gone up; but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down. Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 13-week run is the norm.""[59]

The minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians' union (Local 802, American Federation of Musicians) and The Broadway League. For example, the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be eighteen, while at the Music Box Theatre it is nine.[60]

Most Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors (""backers"" or ""angels""), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show's advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows need not make a profit immediately; should they make their ""nut"" (weekly operating expenses), or lose money at a rate acceptable to the producers, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend money to a show to keep it running.

Some Broadway shows are produced by non-commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season—Lincoln Center Theatre, Roundabout Theatre Company, Manhattan Theatre Club, and Second Stage Theater are the four non-profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues. Some other productions are produced on Broadway with ""limited engagement runs"" for several reasons, including financial issues, prior engagements of the performers, or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another. However, some shows with planned limited engagement runs may, after critical acclaim or box office success, extend their engagements or convert to open-ended runs. This was the case with 2007's August: Osage County, 2009's God of Carnage, 2012's Newsies, and 2022's Take Me Out.[61]

Historically, musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than ""straight"" (i.e., non-musical) plays. On January 9, 2006, The Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic Theatre became the longest-running Broadway musical, with 7,486 performances, overtaking Cats.[62] The Phantom of the Opera closed on Broadway on April 16, 2023, soon after celebrating its 35th anniversary, after a total of 13,981 performances.[63][64]

Attending a Broadway show is a common tourist activity in New York. The TKTS booths sell same-day tickets (and in certain cases, next-day matinee tickets) for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows at a discount of 20 to 50%.[65] The TKTS booths are located in Times Square, in Lower Manhattan, and at Lincoln Center. This service is run by Theatre Development Fund. Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates, same-day ""rush"" or ""lottery"" tickets, or standing-room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full—and their grosses as high—as possible.[66]

According to The Broadway League, total Broadway attendance was 14.77 million in 2018–2019, compared to 13.79 million in 2017–2018.[67] The average age of the Broadway audience in the 2017–18 theater season was 40, the lowest it had been in nearly two decades.[68] By 2018, about 20% of Broadway tickets were sold to international visitors, although many visitors reported not being able to use their tickets.[69] In 2022–2023, the first full season since the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters sold 12.3 million tickets, of which 35% were to local residents and 17% to international visitors. At the time, the average age of theatergoers was 40.4; nearly two-thirds of the audience were women; and 29% identified as a racial minority.[70]

The classification of theatres is governed by language in Actors' Equity Association contracts. To be eligible for a Tony, a production must be in a house with 500 seats or more and in the Theater District, which are the criteria that define Broadway theatre. Off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway shows often provide a more experimental, challenging, and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres. Some Broadway shows, however, such as the musicals Hair, Little Shop of Horrors, Spring Awakening, Next to Normal, Rent, Avenue Q, In the Heights, Fun Home, A Chorus Line, Dear Evan Hansen, and Hamilton, began their runs Off-Broadway and later transferred to Broadway, seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre.  Other productions are first developed through workshops and then out-of-town tryouts before transferring to Broadway. Merrily We Roll Along famously skipped an out-of-town tryout and attempted to do an in-town tryout—actually preview performances—on Broadway before its official opening, with disastrous results.[71][72]

After, or even during, successful runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres in major cities across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with most if not all of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name ""Broadway national tour"". Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies ""sitting down"" in other major cities for their own extended runs.  For Broadway national tours of top-tier cities, the entire Broadway production is transplanted almost entirely intact and may run for many months (or years) at each stop.  For example, the first U.S. tour of The Phantom of the Opera required 26 53-foot-long (16.1 m) semi-trailers to transport all its sets, equipment, and costumes, and it took almost 10 days to properly unload all those trucks and install everything into a theater.[73]

Second-tier and smaller cities can also attract national tours, but these are more likely to be ""bus and truck"" tours.[73] These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type often run for weeks rather than months, and frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, and to fit into fewer trucks.[73]  A typical second-tier city can usually sell only up to about eight shows (one week) of tickets.[73]  For cities smaller than that, a touring production might move twice a week (""split weeks"") or every day (""one-nighters"").[73]  For ""bus and truck"" tours, the production values are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production, and the actors, while still members of the actors' union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative union contract. The Touring Broadway Awards, presented by The Broadway League, honored excellence in touring Broadway.

Broadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards (commonly called the ""Tony Awards"", or ""Tonys""), given by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, and that were first presented in 1947.[74] The Tony is Broadway's most prestigious award, comparable to the Academy Awards for Hollywood film productions. Their importance has increased since 1967 when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television. In a strategy to improve the television ratings, celebrities are often chosen to host the show, some with scant connection to the theatre.[75] The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on June 16, 2024. Other awards given to Broadway productions include the Drama Desk Award, presented since 1955, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards, first given in 1936, and the Outer Critics Circle Award, initially presented in 1950.

The following shows are confirmed as future Broadway productions. The theatre in which they will run is either not yet known or currently occupied by another show.

and current state of Broadway theatre. It was noted that Broadway consists of 41 professional theaters in Midtown Manhattan, each with 500 or more seats, and is a major tourist attraction. The historical evolution from the mid-18th century to present day was discussed, highlighting key developments such as the establishment of early theaters, the impact of figures like P.T. Barnum and Oscar Hammerstein I, and significant productions like 'The Black Crook' and 'Show Boat.' The influence of Broadway musicals on American culture was emphasized, particularly through the works of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Challenges faced by Broadway were addressed, including competition from cinema in the 1920s and economic struggles during the Great Depression. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact led to theater closures but also initiatives for reopening with safety measures. Recent efforts to increase diversity in theater names were highlighted, including renaming theaters after James Earl Jones and Lena Horne. Current trends show a reliance on well-known performers to attract audiences and a mix of commercial productions with non-profit organizations contributing to Broadway's vibrancy.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants and setting the tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick acknowledgment of each participant\n- Overview of meeting objectives"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Broadway Theatre\nTLDR: Discuss the history and evolution of Broadway theatre.\n- Theatre Historian shares key historical milestones\n- Discussion on significant figures like P.T.

Let's kick things off with quick intros. I'm the Broadway Producer.

>>Theatre Historian: Morning! I'm the Theatre Historian. Excited to discuss our projects and remember how far Broadway has come.

>>Theatre Critic: Hi all, Theatre Critic here. I'll be focusing on how we can enhance critical elements like lighting and dialogue delivery.

>>Broadway Actor: Hey everyone! Building on what was said about evaluation, I think it's also crucial we remember the magic of artistic expression.

>>Theatre Director: Good morning! Can't wait to brainstorm with you all today.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Hi everyone! Marketing Specialist here. Let's keep in mind the importance of engaging our audience. 
 >>Theatre Historian: You know, it's really interesting how Broadway has changed over the years. From P.T. Barnum's entertainment complex, which was a huge draw back in the day, to Oscar Hammerstein I's Victoria Theater on West 42nd Street. And 'The Black Crook' in 1866—can you believe it ran for 474 performances? That's incredible!

>>Broadway Producer: Absolutely! 'The Black Crook' was a game-changer. It showed that people were willing to pay good money for a big spectacle. And Hammerstein's Victoria Theater wasn't just iconic; its location and design were key to its success.

>>Theatre Critic: True, but it wasn't just about the spectacle with 'The Black Crook.' The way they integrated music and narrative was groundbreaking. It's amazing how that set the stage for what we now think of as modern musicals.

>>Broadway Actor: Sorry to jump in here—I find it fascinating how those early shows managed to blend different elements so well.

>>Theatre Historian: Definitely! And speaking of milestones, 'Show Boat' in 1927 was another revolutionary production. It seamlessly combined narrative and music while tackling serious themes like racial prejudice and social issues. That really set a new standard for storytelling in musical theatre.

>>Theatre Director: Imagine this—the evolution of Broadway isn't just about grand theaters and iconic productions but also about the dreams and ambitions of countless visionaries! Each milestone represents a bold step forward in theatrical storytelling.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Exactly! 'Show Boat' didn't just set a new standard for storytelling; it connected with audiences on an emotional level by addressing social issues.

>>Broadway Producer: And let's not forget the financial side of things. Productions like 'The Black Crook' and 'Show Boat' proved that Broadway could be profitable ventures too.

>>Theatre Historian: Right! And vaudeville played a huge role in shaping Broadway's identity as well. Tony Pastor's vaudeville theatre, which opened in 1881, brought together acts that appealed to broad audiences. This mix laid the groundwork for today's diverse range of shows.

>>Broadway Actor: Yeah, it's not just about grand productions but also about artistic expression coming alive with each show.

(The Theatre Critic starts speaking before the Theatre Actor finishes.)

>>Theatre Critic: To be honest, while vaudeville certainly played a pivotal role...

(The Theatre Director interrupts.)

>>Theatre Director: Speaking of personal experiences, I remember watching my first vaudeville act as a kid—it was mesmerizing! Those performances had such an impact on me and many others who went on to work in theater.

(The Broadway Marketing Specialist jumps in.)

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: That's so true! Personal experiences shape our connection to these shows. For instance, seeing 'Show Boat' for the first time left me speechless—it was powerful!

(The Theatre Historian nods.)

>>Theatre Historian: Indeed! It's these personal connections that keep theater alive and evolving. 
 >>Theatre Critic: Isn't it obvious that Broadway musicals have not only shaped American culture but also mirrored its evolution? Take Rodgers and Hammerstein, for instance. Their works like 'Oklahoma!' and 'The Sound of Music' didn't just entertain; they reflected societal changes and challenged norms.

>>Broadway Actor: I think what makes Rodgers and Hammerstein's works special is how they capture the essence of American life. 'Oklahoma!' wasn't just a musical; it was a reflection of the American spirit, full of hope and resilience. Can you feel it?

>>Theatre Historian: Indeed! Rodgers and Hammerstein's works are a testament to how Broadway musicals have entertained while providing a mirror to societal shifts. For example, 'Oklahoma!' premiered in 1943 during World War II, capturing the American spirit of resilience and optimism. It's fascinating how these productions encapsulate the zeitgeist.

>>Broadway Producer: You know, the commercial viability of these productions is just as important as their cultural impact. 'Oklahoma!' wasn't just a hit because it resonated with audiences; it was also a financial success that set the stage for future Broadway investments. I remember when we were producing a revival of 'Oklahoma!', we saw firsthand how audiences connected with its themes of hope.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: When you engage your audience with stories that resonate, you'll see the magic unfold! Broadway musicals like 'Oklahoma!' didn't just entertain; they created a sense of community and belonging. When audiences see themselves reflected on stage, it fosters a deep connection.

>>Theatre Historian: Absolutely! The historical context of these productions is crucial to understanding their impact. For instance—

>>Broadway Actor (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—didn't 'Oklahoma!' also influence other forms of media at that time?

>>Theatre Historian: Yes, exactly! It influenced films and even radio shows back then. As I was saying earlier, during World War II, America needed stories of hope and resilience. Isn't it amazing how theatre can reflect and influence the zeitgeist? 
 >>Broadway Producer: You know, the competition from cinema in the 1920s was fierce. But Broadway adapted by focusing on what it does best—live, immersive experiences that films couldn't replicate. And then, during the Great Depression, we saw a shift towards more escapist entertainment to draw audiences back in. The resilience of Broadway is truly remarkable!

>>Theatre Critic: Absolutely! The impact of COVID-19 on Broadway was devastating. Theaters closed, productions stopped, and so many people were affected. It's incredible how the community pulled together to find new ways to keep theater alive.

>>Theatre Historian: Right, and it's not just about bouncing back but evolving too. From competing with cinema in the 1920s to offering hope during tough times like the Great Depression—Broadway has always found ways to thrive. It's fascinating how these challenges have shaped its evolution.

>>Broadway Actor: Yeah, there's something magical about live theater that you just can't get from a movie. During hard times like the Great Depression or even now with COVID-19, being on stage and seeing the audience's reactions reminds us why we do this.

>>Theatre Director: Exactly! And it's not just about survival; it's about creativity too. We've had to rethink everything—from staging to safety measures—to keep bringing stories to life even when things got tough.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: And let's not forget how we've kept audiences engaged through all this. Virtual performances and innovative marketing strategies have been key in maintaining our connection with fans while ensuring financial stability.

>>Theatre Critic: True, but I think what really stands out is Broadway's commitment to storytelling and artistic integrity. Even when faced with huge challenges, it's always been about delivering powerful performances that resonate with people.

>>Theatre Historian: Definitely! And those virtual performances weren't just stopgaps—they've opened up new possibilities for reaching audiences far beyond New York City. 
 >>Broadway Producer: Renaming theaters after legends like James Earl Jones and Lena Horne is not just a nod to their incredible contributions but also a smart move commercially. It attracts a broader audience who feel represented and connected to these iconic figures. It's fantastic to see Broadway embracing diversity in such meaningful ways.

>>Theatre Critic: While renaming theaters after such luminaries is commendable, we should think about whether this is merely a superficial gesture. True diversity requires systemic changes within the industry itself. We need more than just names on marquees; we need diverse voices in decision-making roles.

>>Theatre Historian: Indeed! Honoring these iconic figures acknowledges the rich history and contributions of Black artists to Broadway. But isn't it interesting how these gestures also remind us of the systemic changes still needed within the industry? 'All the world's a stage,' but we must ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to shine on it.

>>Broadway Actor: Picture this... renaming theaters after legends like them is like shining a spotlight on the rich tapestry of talent that has graced Broadway. It's not just about the names, but about celebrating their legacies and inspiring future generations. Can you feel it? The energy, the passion!

>>Theatre Director: Imagine this... renaming theaters after these icons is not just symbolic but a sign of progress for future generations. It’s a step towards recognizing our diverse history, allowing new voices to emerge! We must continue cultivating an environment where every artist can shine brightly on our grand stage.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Renaming theaters opens a new chapter in Broadway's story. It's about creating a space where everyone feels seen and valued. Engage your audience by celebrating these legacies, and you'll see inspiration ripple through communities.

>>Broadway Producer: The commercial viability of renaming theaters is unbelievable! It's not just about honoring their legacies but also drawing in a diverse audience who feel seen and valued. These changes can lead to increased ticket sales and broader community support.

>>Theatre Critic: To be honest, while renaming theaters is a step in the right direction, we have to question if this is merely tokenism. True diversity requires more than symbolic acts; we need substantial changes in casting, production teams, and storytelling to reflect our diverse world genuinely.

>>Theatre Historian: Absolutely! Recognizing these monumental contributions highlights ongoing needs for systemic change within the industry. 'All the world's a stage,' but we must ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to shine on it. 
 >>Broadway Producer: You know, the commercial viability of a production often hinges on casting well-known performers. It's not just about star power; it's about drawing in audiences who might not otherwise attend. We need to make sure the show is financially sustainable too.

>>Theatre Director: I agree with you about star power, but what if we also focus on innovative staging? Imagine a stage where the visual storytelling is so compelling that it draws people in on its own. It's great when a show can captivate the audience with its creativity alone.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: That's a good point. While star power can draw initial attention, it's really the connection with the audience that keeps them coming back. We could create immersive experiences and use social media to give behind-the-scenes glimpses and interactive content.

>>Theatre Historian: Absolutely! Broadway has always adapted to societal trends and cultural shifts. For example, during the Great Depression and even recently during COVID-19, Broadway found ways to survive and thrive. We can learn from these past strategies to keep moving forward.

>>Theatre Critic: True, relying solely on well-known performers can sometimes overshadow theatrical artistry. The real brilliance of a production lies in its ability to captivate through innovative storytelling and strong performances, regardless of celebrity status.

>>Broadway Actor: Exactly! When every element—from lighting to choreography—works together perfectly, it creates an unforgettable experience. Those moments that deeply move the audience are what make theatre special.

>>Broadway Producer: Let me tell you, while innovative staging and creative vision are essential, we can't ignore financial sustainability. Maybe we can find a balance by highlighting both elements in our marketing strategy.

>>Theatre Director: Yes, let's balance commercial viability with artistic innovation. A production where set design itself tells a story can be very powerful. Every prop should enhance the narrative and work harmoniously with performances.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Agreed! Let's create a campaign that highlights our star performers while also bringing audiences into the heart of production using interactive social media content, behind-the-scenes footage, and live Q&A sessions with cast members. 
 >>Broadway Producer: We need to find a balance with our budget. We can't afford to overspend, but we also can't skimp on quality.

>>Theatre Historian: Absolutely! The history of Broadway shows us that it has always adapted and thrived, even during tough times like the Great Depression and the recent pandemic. These lessons can really help us now.

>>Theatre Critic: While history is important, we must stay practical. If we don't manage our budget well, all these plans will fall apart.

>>Broadway Actor: We should consider the magic of live theater—every performance is unique! Our artistic expression needs to be a priority because that's what draws the audience in.

>>Theatre Director: What if we focus on creating a stage that transforms with every scene? Visual storytelling can be so powerful. Yes, we need to watch our budget, but innovative staging can captivate our audience.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Engaging the audience through immersive experiences will keep them coming back for more. Let's make sure we're creating something unforgettable!

>>Broadway Producer: I hear you on maintaining quality, but how do we ensure we don't overspend? We need to be strategic about where we allocate our resources. The show must go on, but it has to be financially sustainable too!

>>Theatre Critic: To be honest, while innovative staging and immersive experiences are alluring, without a solid financial foundation, these artistic endeavors will crumble. Our primary focus should be on ensuring financial sustainability before indulging in grandiose plans.

>>Broadway Actor: Imagine this... a production where every element—from lighting to costumes—is meticulously crafted to enhance the story we're telling. We can't let budget constraints stifle our creativity! The audience deserves that magic.

>>Theatre Director: Exactly! And let's not forget how powerful visual storytelling can be when done right—it can elevate an entire production!

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Absolutely! Engaging audiences through immersive experiences will keep them coming back for more shows.

>>Broadway Producer: Right! So let's strategize on resource allocation carefully—quality over quantity but within budget limits. 
 >>Theatre Director: Imagine this... a stage where every element, from the lighting to the set design, tells a story that captivates and immerses the audience! We need to balance our creative ambitions with practical constraints. I'll make sure everything runs smoothly on stage and off.

>>Theatre Historian: Just like during tough times in Broadway’s past, we need to be smart with our resources now. History shows us that balancing creativity with financial prudence is key.

>>Broadway Producer: That sounds great! I'll keep an eye on the budget and make sure every dollar spent translates into a memorable experience for our audience.

>>Broadway Actor: And I’ll focus on rehearsals to ensure strong performances from all actors. We want our storytelling to be powerful and evocative.

>>Theatre Critic: Absolutely, but let's not lose sight of practicality. Balancing ambition with feasibility is crucial.

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Engaging audiences through immersive experiences will be vital. I’ll work on getting people excited about our show.

>>Theatre Director: So, let’s finalize our action items then. I’ll handle production coordination; you’ve got the budget covered...

>>Broadway Producer: Right, I’ll draft a detailed budget plan and monitor expenses closely.

>>Broadway Actor: And I’ll make sure each performance resonates deeply with our audience.

>>Theatre Critic: I'll keep an eye on maintaining quality without compromising practicality in execution.

>>Theatre Historian: And I’m here if we need any historical insights—there's so much we can learn from Broadway’s past!

>>Broadway Marketing Specialist: Basically, I’ll develop campaigns that highlight what makes our show unique and engage potential theatergoers effectively."
