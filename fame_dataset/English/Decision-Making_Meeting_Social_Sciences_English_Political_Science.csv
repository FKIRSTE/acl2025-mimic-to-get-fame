Political Science,"

Political science is the scientific study of politics. It is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political thought, political behavior, and associated constitutions and laws. Specialists in the field are political scientists.

Political science is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political institutions, political thought and behavior, and associated constitutions and laws.[1]

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century and began to separate itself from political philosophy and history.[2] Into the late 19th century, it was still uncommon for political science to be considered a distinct field from history.[2] The term ""political science"" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.[citation needed]

Generally, classical political philosophy is primarily defined by a concern for Hellenic and Enlightenment thought,[3] political scientists are also marked by a great concern for ""modernity"" and the contemporary nation state, along with the study of classical thought, and as such share more terminology with sociologists (e.g., structure and agency).[4]


The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. The designation ""political scientist"" is commonly used to denote someone with a doctorate or master's degree in the field.[5] Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both normative and positive political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the American Political Science Review were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena. APSA membership rose from 204 in 1904 to 1,462 in 1915.[2] APSA members played a key role in setting up political science departments that were distinct from history, philosophy, law, sociology, and economics.[2]
The journal Political Science Quarterly was established in 1886 by the Academy of Political Science. In the inaugural issue of Political Science Quarterly, Munroe Smith defined political science as ""the science of the state. Taken in this sense, it includes the organization and functions of the state, and the relation of states one to another.""[6]

As part of a UNESCO initiative to promote political science in the late 1940s, the International Political Science Association was founded in 1949, as well as national associations in France in 1949, Britain in 1950, and West Germany in 1951.[2]

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioral revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behavior swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behavior, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioral political science, including work by Robert Dahl, Philip Converse, and in the collaboration between sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld and public opinion scholar Bernard Berelson.[citation needed]

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a takeoff in the use of deductive, game-theoretic formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behavior, such as voting. William H. Riker and his colleagues and students at the University of Rochester were the main proponents of this shift.[citation needed]

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all types of scholarship discussed above, scholars have noted that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.[7]

In 2000, the Perestroika Movement in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.[8]

Some evolutionary psychology theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic cognitive biases of current politics.[9]

Political science is a social study concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making, the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations, political behaviour, and public policies. It measures the success of governance and specific policies by examining many factors, including stability, justice, material wealth, peace, and public health. Some political scientists seek to advance positive theses (which attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) by analysing politics; others advance normative theses, such as by making specific policy recommendations. The study of politics and policies can be closely connectedâ€”for example, in comparative analyses of which types of political institutions tend to produce certain types of policies.[10] Political science provides analysis and predictions about political and governmental issues.[11] Political scientists examine the processes, systems and political dynamics of countries and regions of the world, often to raise public awareness or to influence specific governments.[11]

Political scientists may provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the electorate analyze issues. According to Chaturvedy,

Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties, or as civil servants. They may be involved with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to corporations. Private enterprises such as think tanks, research institutes, polling and public relations firms often employ political scientists.[12]
Political scientists may study political phenomena within one specific country. For example, they may study just the politics of the United States[13] or just the politics of China.[14]

Political scientists look at a variety of data, including constitutions, elections, public opinion, and public policy, foreign policy, legislatures, and judiciaries. Political scientists will often focus on the politics of their own country; for example, a political scientist from Indonesia may become an expert in the politics of Indonesia.[15]

The theory of political transitions,[16] and the methods of analyzing and anticipating[17] crises,[18] form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.[19] Among them, one statistical indicator of crisis, a simultaneous increase of variance and correlations in large groups, was proposed for crisis anticipation and may be successfully used in various areas.[20] Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 Ukrainian economic and political crisis. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.[21] A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.[22]

The study of major crises, both political crises and external crises that can affect politics, is not limited to attempts to predict regime transitions or major changes in political institutions. Political scientists also study how governments handle unexpected disasters, and how voters in democracies react to their governments' preparations for and responses to crises.[23]

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, political philosophy, and many others, in addition to those that developed chiefly within the field of political science. 

Political scientists approach the study of politics from a host of different ontological orientations and with a variety of different tools. Because political science is essentially a study of human behavior, in all aspects of politics, observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though experimental methods are increasingly common (see experimental political science).[24] Citing this difficulty, former American Political Science Association President Lawrence Lowell once said ""We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science.""[17] Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices, unlike other subjects, such as non-human organisms in biology, minerals in geoscience, chemical elements in chemistry, stars in astronomy, or particles in physics. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics, and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

Empirical political science methods include the use of field experiments,[25] surveys and survey experiments,[26] case studies,[27] process tracing,[28][29] historical and institutional analysis,[30] ethnography,[31] participant observation,[32] and interview research.[33]

Political scientists also use and develop theoretical tools like game theory and agent-based models to study a host of political systems and situations.[34] Other approaches include the study of equation-based models and opinion dynamics.[35]

Political theorists approach theories of political phenomena with a similar diversity of positions and tools, including feminist political theory, historical analysis associated with the Cambridge school, and Straussian approaches.

Political science may overlap with topics of study that are the traditional focuses of other social sciencesâ€”for example, when sociological norms or psychological biases are connected to political phenomena. In these cases, political science may either inherit their methods of study or develop a contrasting approach.[36] For example, Lisa Wedeen has argued that political science's approach to the idea of culture, originating with Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba and exemplified by authors like Samuel P. Huntington, could benefit from aligning more closely with the study of culture in anthropology.[36] In turn, methodologies that are developed within political science may influence how researchers in other fields, like public health, conceive of and approach political processes and policies.[37]

The most common piece of academic writing in generalist political sciences is the research paper, which investigates an original research question.[38][39]

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, can be described ""as a discipline which lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the sciences and the humanities.""[40] Thus, in most American colleges, especially liberal arts colleges, it would be located within the school or college of arts and sciences. If no separate college of arts and sciences exists, or if the college or university prefers that it be in a separate constituent college or academic department, then political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of humanities or liberal arts.[41] At some universities, especially research universities and in particular those that have a strong cooperation between research, undergraduate, and graduate faculty with a stronger more applied emphasis in public administration, political science would be taught by the university's public policy school.

Most United States colleges and universities offer BA programs in political science. MA or MAT and PhD or EdD programs are common at larger universities. The term political science is more popular in post-1960s North America than elsewhere while universities predating the 1960s or those historically influenced by them would call the field of study government;[42] other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of political studies or politics in general. While political science implies the use of the scientific method, political studies implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content. Separate, specialized or, in some cases, professional degree programs in international relations, public policy, and public administration are common at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, although most but not all undergraduate level education in these sub-fields of political science is generally found in academic concentrations within a political science academic major. Master's-level programs in public administration are professional degrees covering public policy along with other applied subjects; they are often seen as more linked to politics than any other discipline, which may be reflected by being housed in that department.[43]

The main national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is Pi Sigma Alpha, while Pi Alpha Alpha is a national honor society specifically designated for public administration.

It's great to see familiar faces here. Our main objective today is to outline the key steps for implementing the new policy framework effectively.
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely. To put it in perspective, we need strategic steps for effective implementation. Any thoughts on prioritizing these steps?
>>Political Philosopher: I agree. We should ensure that our theoretical underpinnings are robust as we outline these steps. Perhaps we can start with defining our core principles?
>>Political Historian: That's a good point. Historically speaking, learning from past successes and failures will be crucial in shaping our approach.
>>Political Analyst: Definitely! Let's focus on those key steps while keeping historical insights in mind. 
 >>Political Historian: You know, the late 19th century was a real turning point in academia. Political science started to stand on its own, breaking away from history and political philosophy. This era saw universities setting up dedicated departments and organizations like APSA coming into play, which really helped shape the field.

>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! That separation allowed for a more focused analysis of governance systems and political behavior. It was crucial for developing rigorous academic inquiry.

>>Political Philosopher: Right, it wasn't just structural; it redefined intellectual boundaries too. We could explore governance systems distinct from philosophical inquiries or historical narratives. How does this impact our understanding today?

>>Public Policy Advisor: Exactly! This shift has been vital for practical policy applicationâ€”helping us focus directly on governance systems and political behavior when developing policies now.

>>(Phone rings briefly)

>>(Participants pause momentarily)

>>(Phone stops ringing)

>>Political Analyst: Ha, always at the wrong time! Anywayâ€”

>>Public Policy Advisor: So how have these methodological advancements shaped our current policy frameworks? This empirical approach is key for addressing contemporary issues effectively.

>>Political Scientist: Good question! Methodological advancements like statistical analysis and comparative studies emerged during this period, enabling scholars to conduct more rigorous research.

>>Political Philosopher: And ethically speaking, this empirical approach has profound implications for analyzing contemporary dynamicsâ€”emphasizing methodological rigor over purely theoretical constructs. 
 >>Political Scientist: The behavioral revolution marked a significant shift in political science, focusing on the systematic study of individual and group behavior. Integrating economic theories into political analysis provided a more analytical framework for understanding political institutions and behaviors. It's been fascinating to see how this approach has evolved over time.
>>Political Historian: Absolutely, looking back at history, it was remarkable how this shift allowed us to understand political dynamics beyond just institutions. It mirrored broader scientific trends of the time, emphasizing empirical research and data-driven analysis. Remember how it changed our view on voter behavior?
>>Public Policy Advisor: Right, and that practical lens really helped in policy development. Applying economic theories has been crucial for crafting policies that reflect societal needsâ€”like when we revamped welfare programs based on behavioral insights.
>>Political Philosopher: From a theoretical standpoint, it's interesting how this shift challenges us to reconsider our interpretations of political behavior. But what does this mean for today's policy frameworks? Are we adapting enough?
>>Political Analyst: Good point! The integration wasn't just methodological; it was necessary. Without these approaches, we'd struggle with contemporary issues like climate change policies or healthcare reform. How do you think we're doing with those?
>>Political Scientist: Well, we've made strides thanks to analytical insights from the behavioral revolution, but progress towards a systematic theory is still uneven. Take healthcare reformâ€”it's complex because human behavior isn't always predictable.
>>Public Policy Advisor: Exactly! That's why flexibility is key in policy developmentâ€”we need to adapt based on evidence as new data comes in. Look at how we've adjusted educational policies recently.
>>Political Philosopher: And ethically speaking, continuous adaptation is essential due to the emphasis on empirical evidence over normative theories. But are we considering ethical implications enough when making these changes?
>>Political Historian: Historically speaking, uneven progress reflects broader challenges faced by social sciencesâ€”the complexities of human behavior are tough to quantify and predict. Think about the shifts in public opinion during major elections.
>>Political Analyst: While valuable insights have emerged regarding political behavior and institutionsâ€”we must acknowledge limitations; sometimes current frameworks lack consistency because they're trying to keep up with rapid changes. 
 >>Political Scientist: The Perestroika Movement calls for using different methods like field experiments, surveys, case studies, and game theory. How does this affect our understanding of political dynamics?
>>Public Policy Advisor: Using various methods helps us create policies that work in real life. Combining field experiments with case studies can address complex political issues better.
>>Political Philosopher: This movement makes us rethink how we study politics. Using different methods could give us a deeper and more ethical understanding.
>>Political Historian: Historically, this push for diverse methods is a response to rigid structures in late 20th-century political science. To put it in historical perspectiveâ€”
>>Political Analyst (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! Just wanted to add that these shifts often come with resistance from traditionalists within the field. How do we handle that?
>>Political Historian: Good point! As I was saying, this movement echoes earlier shifts like the behavioral revolution which also sought to diversify approaches and challenge established norms. Navigating resistance involves demonstrating tangible benefits through successful application of diverse methodologies. What can we learn from this? How does history inform us about the potential benefits and pitfalls of embracing diverse methodologies?
>>Political Analyst: While the Perestroika Movement's push for methodological plurality is commendable, we need to consider how these diverse approaches actually impact our understanding of political dynamics today. What are the implications for policy-making when we integrate methods like game theory with field experiments? It's about finding a balance that enhances both theoretical insight and practical application.
>>Political Scientist: Based on the Perestroika Movement's advocacy for methodological plurality, we must critically evaluate how integrating diverse methods like game theory and field experiments can enhance our understanding of political dynamics. What does this imply for the robustness of our theoretical models? Fascinating!
>>Public Policy Advisor: Well, let's be clear about this: integrating diverse methodologies isn't just about enhancing theoretical models; it's about crafting policies that are adaptable and responsive to real-world challenges. What are the implications for policy-making when we embrace such methodological diversity? 
 >>Political Scientist: According to analytical frameworks within political science, the influence on various sectors like journalism and NGOs is profound. These entities often rely on political scientists for insights into governance systems and crisis management strategies. How can we interpret this reliance in terms of shaping public discourse?
>>Political Philosopher: Absolutely, this reliance underscores the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in our analyses to ensure that public discourse is both informed and principled.
>>Public Policy Advisor: Political science gives journalists and NGOs essential tools for interpreting complex political issues. How does this reliance impact their ability to influence policy decisions?
>>Political Historian: Historically speaking, this relationship dates back to the Enlightenment when thinkers influenced governance systems profoundly. What can we learn from this enduring relationship?
>>Political Analyst: We need to consider how this reliance impacts their credibility. If these sectors are heavily influenced by political analysisâ€”
>>Public Policy Advisor (interrupting): Sorry to jump in hereâ€”are we considering how this might affect their advocacy efforts too? I think that's crucial.
>>Political Analyst: Absolutely! Advocacy efforts are definitely part of it. If these sectors are heavily influenced by political analysis, what are the implications for unbiased reporting and advocacy? How does this affect trust in these institutions?
>>(A phone rings briefly but stops)
>>(Participants pause momentarily)
>>Public Policy Advisor: Let's get back on trackâ€”how does this reliance impact their credibility?
>>(Meeting resumes)
>>Political Scientist: Building on what we've discussed, we need to consider how this reliance impacts credibility and independence. What does this imply for unbiased reporting?
>>(Participants nodding) 
 >>Political Scientist: Considering our interdisciplinary nature, we often borrow methods from sociology and psychology to study voter behavior. How does this influence our analysis?

>>Political Philosopher: That's a good point. From a philosophical view, these intersections offer ethical insights into human behavior in politics. We need to think about our moral responsibilities in shaping political systems.

>>Public Policy Advisor: I agree with the philosopher's point about ethical dimensions. Integrating psychological theories can help us develop policies that truly resonate with people's needs. For instance, using these theories helped us design better mental health programs that address public needs effectively.

>>Political Historian: Absolutely! Historically, we've seen how these interdisciplinary approaches reshape our understanding of political behavior. The behavioral revolution in the mid-20th century is a great example of this integration.

>>Political Analyst: Building on what the historian mentioned about past integrations, how can we apply those lessons today? It's crucial for crafting solutions that genuinely resonate with people's lived experiences.

>>Political Scientist: Integrating methodologies from sociology and psychology provides deeper insights into voter behavior. This intersection enriches our analytical frameworks but also challenges us to consider broader implications in political contexts.

>>Public Policy Advisor: Exactly! The practical application of these interdisciplinary insights can lead to policies that are theoretically sound but deeply attuned to communities' realities. This approach could help us craft solutions that genuinely resonate with people's lived experiences.

>>Political Philosopher: In terms of ideas, integrating methodologies compels us to reflect on ethical dimensions like influence and autonomy in political systems. How can we ensure these insights are applied responsibly?

>>Political Historian: Historically speaking, during the behavioral revolution, integrating sociology and psychology allowed us better understand voter behavior beyond mere institutional analysis. What can we learn from these past integrations about addressing today's complex political challenges?

>>Public Policy Advisor: We need to consider how these interdisciplinary insights can be practically appliedâ€”like designing more effective mental health programs by integrating psychological theories into policy-making. 
 >>Political Historian: Looking back at history, integrating different disciplines has led to major advancements in policy-making. During the behavioral revolution, political scientists used psychological theories to understand voter behavior better, which improved electoral strategies. How can we apply this lesson today?
>>Political Scientist: That's a great point about using psychology for voter behavior analysis. But what about our fiscal policies? Should we also consider economic models? How do we balance both approaches?
>>Public Policy Advisor: I agree that both approaches have their merits. Psychological insights can help us connect with voters, while economic models are essential for managing fiscal policies effectively. We need to find a balance that addresses both areas comprehensively.
>>Political Philosopher: Balancing these approaches also raises ethical considerations. How can we ensure our decision-making process includes diverse perspectives? What standards should we set?
>>Political Analyst: Considering today's challenges like social media influence on voters and global fiscal uncertainties, how do these interdisciplinary methods hold up? Can we adapt them effectively?
>>Political Historian: Good question. If we look at the New Deal era, policymakers combined economic theories to tackle fiscal crises and psychological factors to boost public morale. This dual approach helped achieve inclusivity and effectiveness. Maybe that's something we can learn from.
>>Public Policy Advisor: Absolutely, historical examples like the New Deal show us that combining different methods can be powerful. So, how do we implement this practically today? Should we start by integrating psychological insights into our voter outreach programs while using economic models for budget planning?
>>Political Scientist: That sounds like a solid plan. But let's not forget the importance of continuous evaluation and adaptation based on feedback from these initiatives.
>>Political Philosopher: And as we're implementing these strategies, let's keep an eye on the ethical implications tooâ€”ensuring we're inclusive and fair in our approach. 
 >>Public Policy Advisor: Let's draft a plan that outlines these applications, making sure our strategies are inclusive and doable. What are the implications for voter outreach and budget planning?
>>Political Scientist: We need to make sure these strategies work in practice. How can we use what we've learned from history to create a solid plan?
>>Political Historian: The behavioral revolution in political science reshaped our understanding of voter behavior. What can we learn from this to adapt our current strategies?
>>Political Philosopher: Our strategies should reflect inclusivity and ethical responsibility, drawing from historical lessons while addressing contemporary needs.
>>Political Analyst: Considering how these interdisciplinary methods can be practically applied is crucial. Let's outline these applications while ensuring inclusivity.
>>Public Policy Advisor: That's a good point about inclusivity. Let's start by identifying specific methods that have worked well before.
>>Political Scientist: I agree with you there. We also need to think about how these methods will hold up over time.
>>Political Historian: Historically speaking, resistance to interdisciplinary methods often stems from reluctance to abandon traditional approaches. Yet if we consider the behavioral revolution in political science during the mid-20th centuryâ€”it reshaped our understanding of voter behavior and public opinion. What can we learn from these shifts to ensure adaptability?
>>Political Philosopher: In terms of ideas, we must recognize that interdisciplinary methods aren't merely tools but ethical imperatives. Our strategies should reflect inclusivity drawing from historical lessons while addressing contemporary needs.
>>Public Policy Advisor: Alright folks, letâ€™s each take one method we've discussed today and research its application further for our next meeting. 
 >>Political Analyst: We need to make sure our research fits with what's happening politically right now. Let's split up the work based on what we're good atâ€”maybe you (Political Scientist) can look at different research methods and interdisciplinary approaches, you (Political Philosopher) can think about the ethics side of things, and you (Political Historian) can cover the historical background.
>>Political Historian: Historically speaking, integrating diverse methodologies has led to more robust policy frameworks. You know, we should definitely leverage everyone's strengths here.
>>Public Policy Advisor: Alright, let's be clearâ€”the Political Scientist will evaluate interdisciplinary methods due to their analytical expertise; sounds good? The Political Philosopher can focus on ethical implicationsâ€”thanks for taking that onâ€”and the Political Historian should handle historical contextâ€”appreciate your insights there.
>>Political Analyst: Right, so we'll assign interdisciplinary methods evaluation to the Political Scientistâ€”
>>Political Philosopher: Just to clarify, when we talk about ethical implications, do we mean moral principles or practical ethics?
>>Political Analyst: Good questionâ€”we're looking at both how moral principles influence policy decisions and how practical ethics guide implementation strategies.
>>Political Philosopher: Got it. Thanks for clarifying.
>>Political Analyst: No problem. So as I was sayingâ€”the Political Philosopher will focus on ethical implications, and the Political Historian will handle historical context."
