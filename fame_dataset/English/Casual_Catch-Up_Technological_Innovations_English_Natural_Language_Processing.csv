Natural Language Processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and especially artificial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics. Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches in machine learning and deep learning.

Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.

Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s.[1] Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.

The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.

Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[8]

Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:[18][19] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.

Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: 

Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023. 

Before that they were commonly used:

In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.[20][21]

The earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard ifâ€“then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches.
Only the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach.

A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[22] the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach, using semantic networks[23] and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words.  

Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. 

Neural machine translation, based on then-newly invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation.

The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.

Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[46]

Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).

Cognition refers to ""the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.""[47] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[48] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[49] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.

As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[50] with two defining aspects:

Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[53] functional grammar,[54] construction grammar,[55] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[56] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of ""cognitive AI"".[57] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit)[58] and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[59] and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[60] by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J. Friston.

I hope you're all doing well. So, um, today's meeting is mostly about catching up and sharing some updates. And maybe we can throw in a few non-work topics to keep things light.

>>NLP Researcher: Hi there! It's great to see you all. I was thinking we could start by sharing some interesting updates from our respective fields. There's been some fascinating progress in NLP recently that I'd love to discuss later.

>>Computational Linguist: Hey folks! I'm doing well. You know, it's amazing how much our field has evolved with neural networks and deep learning!

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Hey everyone! Yeah, it's crazy how fast things have changed with these new technologies!

>>AI Ethicist: Absolutely! It's incredible to think about the advancements we've seen in such a short time. By the way, anyone got any fun weekend plans?

>>NLP Researcher: Oh, um, actually I was planning to go hiking this weekend if the weather holds up. How about you guys?

>>Computational Linguist: That sounds great! Well, I've been thinking of trying out a new recipe I found onlineâ€”something with lots of spices and flavors.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Nice! You know, I've been meaning to catch up on some movies I've missed lately. Any recommendations?

>>AI Ethicist: Hmm... If you're into thrillers, ""Knives Out"" is pretty good. Keeps you guessing till the end.

>>NLP Researcher: Oh yeah, that's a good one! Speaking of interesting stuff, I've been working on this new NLP model that shows promising results in understanding context better than before.

>>Computational Linguist: Really? That's exciting! You see, context understanding has always been a tricky part of NLP.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Totally agree! Like, getting machines to understand nuances is no small feat.

>>AI Ethicist: Definitely an important area of research. How do you think these advancements in context understanding will impact privacy concerns in AI? 
 >>NLP Researcher: So, um, I recently had the chance to present our latest NLP model at a conference. The feedback was really positive, especially about its improved context understanding. Have you thought about how these advancements might impact real-time language translation applications?

>>Computational Linguist: Well, I've been diving into some fascinating linguistic analysis lately. You know, by examining social media data, we can actually track the evolution of slang and regional dialects in real-time! It's like watching language evolve before our eyes.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: That's awesome! I recently worked on implementing a predictive maintenance model for a manufacturing client. It was great to see how the model could predict equipment failures before they happened, saving them tons of downtime! How did you handle the data preprocessing for your model?

>>AI Ethicist: Hmm... while these advancements in predictive maintenance are impressive, we must consider the broader implications. What if we were to implement such models in healthcare? How does this impact patient privacy and data security?

>>NLP Researcher: Yeah, that's an important point. Speaking of advancements and how they impact our lives, what have you all been up to outside of work?

>>Computational Linguist: Actually, yes! I recently started experimenting with new recipes over the weekends. Last weekend I made this amazing homemade pasta from scratch. It was so satisfying!

>>Machine Learning Engineer: That sounds interesting. I've been getting into hiking lately. Just last weekend I hiked up to this beautiful viewpoint near my place.

>>AI Ethicist: That sounds wonderful! I've been reading a lot more these daysâ€”mostly philosophy and ethics-related books.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Oh, any recommendations? I've been looking for something new to read.

>>AI Ethicist: Sure! I recently finished 'Ethics in the Age of Technology,' which was quite enlightening.

>>NLP Researcher: That's great to hear! I've been spending more time gardening. It's so relaxing and rewarding to see everything grow.

>>Computational Linguist: Gardening sounds lovely! Do you have any favorite plants or flowers you're growing?

>>NLP Researcher: Um, yeah! I'm particularly fond of roses and lavenderâ€”they smell amazing and add such beauty to the garden.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: (nodding) Nice, those are great choices. 
 >>NLP Researcher: The move from rule-based systems to machine learning has really changed how we handle language processing tasks. Have you thought about this?

>>Computational Linguist: Yes, it's interesting how linguistic theories influenced rule-based systems with structured grammar rules. Now, with machine learning, especially neural networks, models learn from data without explicit rulesâ€”more like how a child learns through exposure.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Yeah, exactly! This shift has been revolutionary for real-time translation too. What do you all think about its impact on other applications?

>>AI Ethicist: Ethically speaking, as we rely more on data-driven models, there's a risk of perpetuating biases present in training data. For instance, if our datasets contain biased language use, our models might reinforce those biases.

>>Computational Linguist: Absolutely! With neural networks revealing hidden patterns in language data, it could change how we teach languagesâ€”focusing more on immersive exposure rather than memorizing rules.

>>NLP Researcher (interrupting): Sorry to interruptâ€”do you think this affects how we teach languages too?

>>Computational Linguist: Great question! Yes, absolutely. With neural networks uncovering patterns and nuances in language that were previously hidden, it could indeed influence language education methods by focusing more on immersive exposure rather than rote memorization of rules.

>>NLP Researcher: Notably, the transition has not only revolutionized our technical capabilities but also our theoretical understanding of language. From a computational standpoint, this shift allows us to uncover latent structures and patterns within language data that were previously inaccessible. Have you considered how these advancements might influence future research directions in cognitive linguistics?

>>Computational Linguist: Precisely! The shift has opened up new avenues for linguistic analysis. We can now uncover subtle patterns in language use that were previously hidden. This not only enhances our models but also provides deeper insights into the complexities of human language. 
 >>Machine Learning Engineer: So, let's break it down. From an engineering standpoint, the practical implementation of these neural networks in NLP has been a game-changer! We've seen significant improvements in tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. But yeah, making these models easier to understand is still a big hurdle.

>>NLP Researcher: True, but we also need to think about how complex models affect their speed and efficiency. Have you thought about the trade-offs between model accuracy and computational cost?

>>Computational Linguist: Well, let's consider text classification tasks. The ability to accurately classify text into categories like sentiment or topic is crucial for many applications. But wait, have you considered how we can make these classifications explainable to end-users?

>>AI Ethicist: Exactly! And another thingâ€”ethically speaking, explainability is paramount. Imagine if an NLP model misclassifies critical information in a healthcare settingâ€”the consequences could be dire.

>>NLP Researcher: Notably, scalability is a significant concern too. From an academic perspective, we should delve deeper into optimizing these models to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. What if we explored hybrid approaches that combine neural networks with traditional rule-based systems?

>>Computational Linguist: You see, leveraging linguistic theories could enhance interpretability. By incorporating syntactic and semantic structures, we can provide more transparent insights into how decisions are made by these neural networks.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Right! While neural networks have revolutionized NLP, deploying them in resource-constrained environments can be challenging. How do we ensure our models remain efficient without compromising performance?

>>NLP Researcher: Fascinating! Integrating cognitive models into NLP systems could enhance interpretability. Have you considered how leveraging cognitive linguistics might provide more intuitive explanations for model decisions?

>>Computational Linguist: To illustrate this pointâ€”fine-tuning neural networks for specific text classification tasks by incorporating linguistic features such as syntax and semantics can enhance both interpretability and accuracy.

>>AI Ethicist: And from an ethical standpoint, ensuring transparency in decision-making processes is essential to maintain trust in AI systems.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: I see your point about explainability being important for end-users, but I think developers need clear insights too so they can debug effectively.

>>NLP Researcher: For instance, in our last project on sentiment analysis, we found that combining rule-based methods with neural networks not only improved accuracy but also made the results easier to interpret. 
 >>Computational Linguist: Let's consider the potential of multimodal NLP. By integrating text, audio, and visual data, we can achieve a more holistic understanding of context and meaning. It's like combining different senses to get a fuller picture.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Yeah, exactly! Multimodal NLP is super exciting because it allows us to combine these different types of data for a richer understanding of context. But what do you think about the potential challenges in implementing this?

>>NLP Researcher: Good point! One challenge could be the computational demands. Processing all that data efficiently while maintaining accuracy isn't easy.

>>AI Ethicist: And from an ethical standpoint, we need to think about privacy issues tooâ€”what if we accidentally collect sensitive info through these various modalities? How does this impact society?

>>NLP Researcher: That's true. Also, integrating cognitive models could help make these systems more transparent and improve user trust by explaining how decisions are made.

>>Computational Linguist: Absolutely! Leveraging cognitive models can bridge the gap between raw data processing and meaningful interpretation, making AI systems not only more accurate but also more transparent.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Yes, and optimizing these models for real-time processing is crucial. We need to ensure that each modalityâ€”text, audio, and visualâ€”is processed efficiently without compromising accuracy.

>>AI Ethicist: I see your concern about efficiency. But I'm also worried about biases being amplified through multimodal systems. If we're not careful, we might end up reinforcing existing societal prejudices by integrating biased data from multiple sources.

>>Computational Linguist: Exactly! We have to be vigilant about bias in our datasets. Ensuring fairness and equality in AI applications is just as important as improving accuracy and transparency.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Right! And ensuring transparency is key for user trust especially in sensitive areas like healthcare or finance where decisions have significant impacts on people's lives.

>>NLP Researcher: Absolutely! But balancing transparency with computational efficiency is quite challenging. We need to find ways to scale these systems without losing their interpretability or performance. 
 >>Computational Linguist: Let's consider how multimodal data could enhance our understanding of sarcasm and irony. Imagine combining text with facial expressions and vocal tonesâ€”how much richer would our analysis be?

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Yeah, that's a great point! But integrating all this data sounds like a huge challenge. From an engineering standpoint, it can be quite complex but also incredibly rewarding. For instance, combining text with visual and audio cues could significantly enhance our models' ability to understand context and nuances like sarcasm or irony. What do you think about the computational demands this might introduce?

>>NLP Researcher: Totally! And speaking of accessibility tools, have you thought about how integrating multimodal data could revolutionize them? Combining text with sign language recognition and facial expressions could significantly enhance communication for the deaf community. And what if we also incorporated real-time translation to bridge language barriers?

>>AI Ethicist: That's a good point, but ethically speaking, we must consider the potential biases that multimodal data integration could introduce. If facial recognition systems are trained on biased datasets, they might perpetuate or even amplify existing societal biases. How does this impact our responsibility as developers? We need to ensure our datasets are diverse enough to avoid these issues.

>>NLP Researcher: Notably, have you thought about the potential of multimodal data in enhancing mental health diagnostics? By integrating text analysis with vocal tone and facial expression recognition, we could develop more accurate and empathetic diagnostic tools. What if we also incorporated physiological data like heart rate variability to provide a holistic view?

>>Computational Linguist: You know, from a linguistic perspective, integrating multimodal data could help us better understand language acquisition in children. Imagine combining text with visual and auditory stimuli to see how kids learn new words and concepts. This could have big implications for educational tools.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Consider this: integrating multimodal data could also enhance our ability to detect and respond to emergencies in real-time. Imagine combining text, audio, and visual inputs from various sources like social media, CCTV footage, and emergency calls. How can we ensure the system is both efficient and reliable?

>>NLP Researcher: In essence, the integration of multimodal data could significantly enhance our understanding of human cognition. By analyzing how different modalities interact and influence each other...

>>AI Ethicist (interrupting): Hold onâ€”there's another angle here tooâ€”privacy concerns. With all these different types of data being collected simultaneously, how do we ensure that individuals' privacy is protected? It's crucial that we address these issues before moving forward.

>>Computational Linguist: Right! And imagine using multimodal data to study language evolution over time by combining text, audio, and visual cues from historical recordsâ€”we'd gain a richer understanding of how languages change and adapt.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: Like preserving endangered languages! That would be amazing.

>>NLP Researcher: Fascinating! Have you considered the potential of multimodal data in enhancing personalized learning experiences? By integrating text...

>>AI Ethicist (interrupting): But waitâ€”what about consent? Are users fully aware of what kind of data is being collected about them? We need transparency here.

>>Computational Linguist (overlapping): Absolutely! Transparency is key.

>>Machine Learning Engineer (laughing): Okay folksâ€”one at a time! 
 >>AI Ethicist: You know, as we develop these technologies, we really need to keep an eye on biases and privacy issues. Transparency and fairness should always be our priorities.

>>NLP Researcher: Absolutely. Integrating multimodal data in NLP is a game-changer for understanding human communication, but it does come with its own set of ethical and computational challenges. We need to find that balance between being transparent and efficient.

>>Computational Linguist: Yeah, it's fascinating how we can track language evolution in real-time using social media data. For example, we've seen how certain hashtags can spread new terms rapidly across different regions. This not only helps us understand language dynamics but also opens up new research opportunities.

>>Machine Learning Engineer: I agree. The practical implementation of these models is crucial. We've talked a lot about theory and ethics, but in practice, it's all about balancing efficiency with accuracy. How do you think we should approach optimizing our current models for real-world applications?

>>NLP Researcher: That's a great point. Maybe we could start by focusing on specific use cases where optimization would have the most impact, like customer service chatbots or real-time translation tools.

>>Computational Linguist: And speaking of real-time applications, imagine being able to see how new slang or regional dialects emerge almost instantaneously! It's really exciting because it gives us so many possibilities for both research and practical uses.

>>AI Ethicist: Definitely exciting! But let's not forget the ethical side of things. We need to make sure we're considering the potential biases that might come from using social media data.

>>NLP Researcher: Right, integrating ethical considerations into every stage of NLP development is crucial. It's amazing to see how these advancements can revolutionize various fields while also presenting unique challenges that we must address together."
