Combinatorics,"Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and as an end to obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics and from evolutionary biology to computer science.

Combinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry,[1] as well as in its many application areas. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ad hoc solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right.[2] One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas. Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.

The full scope of combinatorics is not universally agreed upon.[3] According to H. J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions.[4] Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with:

Leon Mirsky has said: ""combinatorics is a range of linked studies which have something in common and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, and the degree of coherence they have attained.""[5] One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella.[6] Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting.

Basic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results appeared throughout the ancient world. The earliest recorded use of combinatorial techniques comes from problem 79 of the Rhind papyrus, which dates to the 16th century BC.  The problem concerns a certain geometric series, and has similarities to Fibonacci's problem of counting the number of compositions of 1s and 2s that sum to a given total.[7] Indian physician Sushruta asserts in Sushruta Samhita that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc., thus computing all 26 − 1 possibilities.  Greek historian Plutarch discusses an argument between Chrysippus (3rd century BCE) and Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to Schröder–Hipparchus numbers.[8][9][10] Earlier, in the Ostomachion, Archimedes (3rd century BCE) may have considered the number of configurations of a tiling puzzle,[11] while combinatorial interests possibly were present in lost works by Apollonius.[12][13]

In the Middle Ages, combinatorics continued to be studied, largely outside of the European civilization. The Indian mathematician Mahāvīra (c. 850) provided formulae for the number of permutations and combinations,[14][15] and these formulas may have been familiar to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century CE.[16]  The philosopher and astronomer Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (c. 1140) established the symmetry of binomial coefficients, while a closed formula was obtained later by the talmudist and mathematician Levi ben Gerson (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.[17]
The arithmetical triangle—a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients—was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as Pascal's triangle. Later, in Medieval England, campanology provided examples of what is now known as Hamiltonian cycles in certain Cayley graphs on permutations.[18][19]

During the Renaissance, together with the rest of mathematics and the sciences, combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth. Works of Pascal, Newton, Jacob Bernoulli and Euler became foundational in the emerging field. In modern times, the works of J.J. Sylvester (late 19th century) and Percy MacMahon (early 20th century) helped lay the foundation for enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Graph theory also enjoyed an increase of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the four color problem.

In the second half of the 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject.[20] In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from functional analysis to number theory, etc.  These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.

Enumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.  Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. Fibonacci numbers is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.  The twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.

Analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory.  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics, which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae.

Partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions, and is closely related to q-series, special functions and orthogonal polynomials.  Originally a part of number theory and analysis, it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.  It incorporates the bijective approach and various tools in analysis and analytic number theory and has connections with statistical mechanics. Partitions can be graphically visualized with Young diagrams or Ferrers diagrams. They occur in a number of branches of mathematics and physics, including the study of symmetric polynomials and of the symmetric group and in group representation theory in general.

Graphs are fundamental objects  in combinatorics.  Considerations of graph theory range from enumeration (e.g., the number of graphs on n vertices with k edges) to existing structures (e.g., Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic representations (e.g., given a graph G and two numbers x and y, does the Tutte polynomial TG(x,y) have a combinatorial interpretation?).  Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, they are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.[21]  While combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two disciplines are generally used to seek solutions to different types of problems.

Design theory is a study of combinatorial designs, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties. Block designs are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in Kirkman's schoolgirl problem proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a Steiner system, which play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.

Combinatorial design theory can be applied to the area of design of experiments.  Some of the basic theory of combinatorial designs originated in the statistician Ronald Fisher's work on the design of biological experiments. Modern applications are also found in a wide gamut of areas including finite geometry, tournament scheduling, lotteries, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, algorithm design and analysis, networking, group testing and cryptography.[22]

Finite geometry is the study of geometric systems having only a finite number of points. Structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries (Euclidean plane, real projective space, etc.) but defined combinatorially are the main items studied. This area provides a rich source of examples for design theory. It should not be confused with discrete geometry (combinatorial geometry).

Order theory is the study of partially ordered sets, both finite and infinite. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as ""this is less than that"" or ""this precedes that"". Various examples of partial orders appear in algebra, geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory.  Notable classes and examples of partial orders include lattices and Boolean algebras.

Matroid theory abstracts part of geometry. It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a vector space that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a linear dependence relation.  Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory.  Matroid theory was introduced by Hassler Whitney and studied as a part of order theory.  It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.

Extremal combinatorics studies how large or how small a collection of finite objects (numbers, graphs, vectors, sets, etc.) can be, if it has to satisfy certain restrictions. Much of extremal combinatorics concerns classes of set systems; this is called extremal set theory. For instance, in an n-element set, what is the largest number of k-element subsets that can pairwise intersect one another?  What is the largest number of subsets of which none contains any other?  The latter question is answered by Sperner's theorem, which gave rise to much of extremal set theory.

The types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties.  For example, the largest triangle-free graph on 2n vertices is a complete bipartite graph Kn,n. Often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer f(n) exactly and one can only give an asymptotic estimate.

Ramsey theory is another part of extremal combinatorics.  It states that any sufficiently large configuration will contain some sort of order. It is an advanced generalization of the pigeonhole principle.

In probabilistic combinatorics, the questions are of the following type: what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find) by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as the probabilistic method) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the mixing time.[clarification needed]

Often associated with Paul Erdős, who did the pioneering work on the subject, probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics. The area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics.

Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that employs methods of abstract algebra, notably group theory and representation theory, in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in algebra. Algebraic combinatorics has come to be seen more expansively as an area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant. Thus the combinatorial topics may be enumerative in nature or involve matroids, polytopes, partially ordered sets, or finite geometries. On the algebraic side, besides group and representation theory, lattice theory and commutative algebra are common.

Combinatorics on words deals with formal languages.  It  arose independently within several branches of mathematics, including number theory, group theory and probability. It has applications to enumerative combinatorics, fractal analysis, theoretical computer science, automata theory, and linguistics. While many applications are new, the classical Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy of classes of formal grammars is perhaps the best-known result in the field.

Geometric combinatorics is related to convex and discrete geometry. It asks, for example, how many faces of each dimension a convex polytope can have.  Metric properties of polytopes play an important role as well, e.g. the Cauchy theorem on the rigidity of convex polytopes.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as permutohedra, associahedra and Birkhoff polytopes. Combinatorial geometry is a historical name for discrete geometry.

It includes a number of subareas such as polyhedral combinatorics (the study of faces of convex polyhedra), convex geometry (the study of convex sets, in particular combinatorics of their intersections), and discrete geometry, which in turn has many applications to computational geometry. The study of regular polytopes, Archimedean solids, and kissing numbers is also a part of geometric combinatorics. Special polytopes are also considered, such as the permutohedron, associahedron and Birkhoff polytope.

Combinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in topology are used to study graph coloring, fair division, partitions, partially ordered sets, decision trees, necklace problems and discrete Morse theory.  It should not be confused with combinatorial topology which is an older name for algebraic topology.

Arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory, and harmonic analysis. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additive number theory (sometimes also called additive combinatorics) refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.  One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the ergodic theory of dynamical systems.

Infinitary combinatorics, or combinatorial set theory, is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets.  It is a part of set theory, an area of mathematical logic, but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics. Some of the things studied include continuous graphs and trees, extensions of Ramsey's theorem, and Martin's axiom. Recent developments concern combinatorics of the continuum[23] and combinatorics on successors of singular cardinals.[24]

Gian-Carlo Rota used the name continuous combinatorics[25] to describe geometric probability, since there are many analogies between counting and measure.

Combinatorial optimization is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to operations research, algorithm theory and computational complexity theory.

Coding theory started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of error-correcting codes. The main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission. It is now a large field of study, part of information theory.

Discrete geometry (also called combinatorial geometry) also began as a part of combinatorics, with early results on convex polytopes and kissing numbers.  With the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to computational geometry, these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study.  There remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics, which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry.

Combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems is another emerging field.  Here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects.  See for example
graph dynamical system.

There are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics, particularly statistical physics. Examples include an exact solution of the Ising model, and a connection between the Potts model on one hand, and the chromatic and Tutte polynomials on the other hand.

>>Mathematician: Hi there! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?
>>Statistician: Hello! I'm good too. Ready to dive into today's agenda.
>>Computer Scientist: Hey folks! I'm great, thanks. I think we should focus on finalizing our project timeline. 
 >>Mathematician: I've been diving into some new combinatorial problems related to graph theory. Specifically, I'm exploring Hamiltonian cycles and their implications for network optimization.

>>Statistician: Looking at it statistically, I've been working on probabilistic methods to evaluate the efficiency of Hamiltonian cycles in network optimization. What if we try using Markov chains to model the transitions between different configurations? This could provide us with valuable insights into their robustness and scalability!

>>Computer Scientist: So, I've been optimizing algorithms for network analysis using Hamiltonian cycles. The idea is to leverage these cycles to improve data routing efficiency and minimize latency.

>>Historian of Mathematics: That's fascinating! You know, the historical context of combinatorial mathematics reveals some interesting insights. For instance, the study of Hamiltonian cycles can be traced back to medieval campanology in England, where permutations were used to create ringing patterns for church bells. It shows how long-standing and practical these combinatorial problems have been.

>>Mathematician: Moreover, the combinatorial properties of Hamiltonian cycles can be quite intriguing. Exploring their extremal characteristics in larger graphs could reveal new insights into network optimization and scalability.

>>Statistician: That's an interesting angle! How do you think Markov chains would compare to other probabilistic methods?

>>Computer Scientist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—I just had a thought. Could we use machine learning techniques alongside Bayesian methods? It might enhance our predictive models significantly.

>>Statistician: That's an excellent point! Integrating machine learning could indeed refine our approach and provide deeper insights. 
 >>Computer Scientist: So, let's break this down... In algorithmic terms, combinatorics can really enhance our approach to solving real-world problems. For instance, optimizing network routing using Hamiltonian cycles is incredible! How can we further leverage these techniques in practical applications?
>>Mathematician: That's a great point. The use of Hamiltonian cycles in network routing is indeed fascinating! We could also look into other combinatorial optimization techniques to boost efficiency and reduce latency.
>>Statistician: Absolutely. When considering Hamiltonian cycles for network routing, probabilistic methods like Markov chains can help us evaluate their efficiency and robustness under different conditions. This way, we can predict the likelihood of certain paths being optimal.

Medieval campanology provided early examples of Hamiltonian cycles in permutations, which are now crucial for network routing optimization. It's amazing how historical insights can inform modern applications.
>>Mathematician: Speaking of modern applications, what if we apply these combinatorial techniques to machine learning models? By leveraging graph theory and spectral analysis, we could potentially improve the efficiency and accuracy of these models.
>>Computer Scientist: Exactly! If we integrate combinatorial optimization with machine learning models, it could significantly enhance their performance. Let's explore how graph theory might help us understand connectivity and robustness better.
>>Statistician: From a statistical perspective, Bayesian methods could refine our machine learning models even further. For example, by incorporating prior knowledge and updating it with new data continuously through Bayesian inference, we'd achieve more accurate predictions and enhance robustness under varying conditions.
>>Historian of Mathematics: Fascinating! The development of graph theory in the 19th century laid foundational principles that are now crucial for modern machine learning models. It's remarkable how these historical advancements continue to shape our current technologies.

>>Statistician: If we analyze the enumeration methods used by ancient civilizations, they were early forms of probabilistic thinking. How can we leverage these insights to enhance our current statistical models? 
 >>Mathematician: Let's look at this from a combinatorial perspective. Combining combinatorics with algebra, topology, and geometry opens up fascinating possibilities! For instance, using group theory in algebraic combinatorics helps solve enumeration problems, while geometric combinatorics explores the properties of polytopes.
>>Computer Scientist: That's interesting! From a practical standpoint, combining combinatorics with coding theory is particularly useful. We use these designs to create efficient error-correcting codes crucial for reliable data transmission. How can we optimize these designs?
>>Historian of Mathematics: Historically speaking, combinatorial designs have roots in ancient civilizations like Mahāvīra's work on permutations as early as the 6th century CE. Can we interpret these historical techniques in modern coding theory?

 >>Computer Scientist: You know, speaking of practical implementations, I remember working on a project where we used machine learning algorithms to optimize network routing. It was incredible how efficient the solution turned out to be! We managed to reduce latency significantly by leveraging neural networks and heuristic methods.

>>Statistician: That's fascinating! I once tackled a problem involving the optimization of resource allocation in a large-scale manufacturing process. By applying probabilistic methods and Markov chains, we managed to predict and mitigate bottlenecks effectively. The complexity was daunting, but the results were quite promising!

>>Mathematician: Yeah, I can relate. I worked on optimizing traffic flow in urban areas using graph theory and network flows. We managed to significantly reduce congestion during peak hours. The complexity was immense, but seeing the results was truly rewarding!

>>Historian of Mathematics: It's interesting you mention that. From a historical perspective, combinatorial problems have evolved over centuries. For instance, Indian mathematicians like Mahāvīra in the 9th century laid foundational principles with their work on permutations and combinations that we still apply today.

>>Computer Scientist: Right! And speaking of practical implementations again, another project involved optimizing data storage using clustering algorithms. It was amazing how efficient it turned out! We reduced retrieval times significantly by leveraging unsupervised learning techniques.

>>Statistician: From a statistical perspective, um...I recall working on optimizing resource distribution in healthcare systems using Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulations. We predicted patient flow and allocated resources more efficiently despite the complexity being immense.

>>Mathematician: That's really impressive! How did you handle the unpredictability in patient flow?

>>Statistician: Well, we used historical data to model different scenarios and ran simulations to forecast outcomes under various conditions. It helped us prepare for unexpected surges.

>>Historian of Mathematics: It's truly fascinating how these techniques have evolved over time. Mahāvīra's work on permutations laid foundational principles that are still relevant today. How do you think these historical techniques can be interpreted in modern applications?

>>Computer Scientist: I agree with exploring network flows, Mathematician. Do you have any specific examples where graph theory has been successfully applied?
>>Statistician: Considering the probabilistic implications is crucial. Using Markov chains to model the efficiency of these algorithms in real-world applications could provide valuable insights.
>>Historian of Mathematics: If we consider the historical context of combinatorial techniques, it's fascinating to see how ancient methods have evolved and continue to influence modern strategies.
>>Mathematician: What if we look at the combinatorial properties of error-correcting codes? Enhancing data transmission reliability through these techniques could be very beneficial.
>>Computer Scientist: Absolutely! Optimizing these combinatorial techniques for modern applications is key. Approaching it practically and integrating them into current designs makes sense. 
 >>Historian of Mathematics: Reflecting on our discussions, it's clear that historical combinatorial techniques have given us some great ideas for modern applications. Let's make sure we use these practically in our projects moving forward.
>>Mathematician: Um, let's summarize what we've talked about today. We've explored Hamiltonian cycles for network optimization and probabilistic methods like Markov chains. Let's focus on integrating these techniques into our machine learning models.
>>Computer Scientist: Right, we've covered a lot today. Building on that, we can leverage historical insights from medieval campanology to enhance our algorithms further.
>>Statistician: Absolutely! From a statistical perspective, we should also consider how these combinatorial techniques can improve our data analysis processes.
>>Historian of Mathematics: Good point! Considering the historical context we've discussed, it will be fascinating to see how these ancient principles can improve modern algorithms.
>>Mathematician: Exactly! This integration will be crucial for refining our algorithms and achieving better results. It's exciting to think about the potential improvements.
>>Computer Scientist: Yeah, so when do you all want to meet next? Maybe in two weeks?
>>Statistician: Two weeks sounds good to me. We can use that time to start implementing some of these ideas and come back with initial findings.
>>Historian of Mathematics: Agreed. Let's set a tentative date then and keep each other updated on progress through emails or calls if needed."
