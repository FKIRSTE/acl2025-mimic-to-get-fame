Nuclear Fusion,"

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei (for example, nuclei of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium), combine to form one or more atomic nuclei and neutrons. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This difference in mass arises as a result of the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the fusion reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active or main-sequence stars and other high-magnitude stars, where large amounts of energy are released.

A nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large binding energy per nucleon. Fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an exothermic process), while the fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite is true for the reverse process, called nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion uses lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, which are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium, thorium and plutonium, are more fissionable. The extreme astrophysical event of a supernova can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.

American chemist William Draper Harkins was the first to propose the concept of nuclear fusion in 1915.[2] Then in 1921, Arthur Eddington suggested hydrogen–helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy.[3] Quantum tunneling was discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1927,[4][5] and shortly afterwards Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans used the measured masses of light elements to demonstrate that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei.[6] Building on the early experiments in artificial nuclear transmutation by Patrick Blackett, laboratory fusion of hydrogen isotopes was accomplished by Mark Oliphant in 1932.[7] In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars was worked out by Hans Bethe. 

Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project. The first artificial thermonuclear fusion reaction occurred during the 1951 Greenhouse Item test of the first boosted fission weapon, which uses a small amount of deuterium–tritium gas to enhance the fission yield. The first thermonuclear weapon detonation, where the vast majority of the yield comes from fusion, was the 1952 Ivy Mike test of a liquid deuterium-fusing device.

While fusion bomb detonations were loosely considered for energy production, the possibility of controlled and sustained reactions remained the scientific focus for peaceful fusion power. Research into developing controlled fusion inside fusion reactors has been ongoing since the 1930s, with Los Alamos National Laboratory's Scylla I device producing the first laboratory thermonuclear fusion in 1958, but the technology is still in its developmental phase.[8]

The US National Ignition Facility, which uses laser-driven inertial confinement fusion, was designed with a goal of achieving a fusion energy gain factor (Q) of larger than one; the first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009 and ignition experiments began in early 2011.[9][10]  On 13 December 2022, the United States Department of Energy announced that on 5 December 2022, they had successfully accomplished break-even fusion, ""delivering 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output.""[11]

Prior to this breakthrough, controlled fusion reactions had been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.[12] The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs). Workable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see ITER). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2025. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025, but is not expected to begin full deuterium–tritium fusion until 2035.[13]

Private companies pursuing the commercialization of nuclear fusion received $2.6 billion in private funding in 2021 alone, going to many notable startups including but not limited to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy Inc., General Fusion, TAE Technologies Inc. and Zap Energy Inc.[14]

One of the most recent breakthroughs to date in maintaining a sustained fusion reaction occurred in France's WEST fusion reactor. It maintained a 90 million degree plasma for a record time of six minutes. This is a tokamak style reactor which is the same style as the upcoming ITER reactor.[15]

The release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the nuclear force, a manifestation of the strong interaction, which holds protons and neutrons tightly together in the atomic nucleus; and the Coulomb force, which causes positively charged protons in the nucleus to repel each other.[17] Lighter nuclei (nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor to allow the nuclear force to overcome the Coulomb force. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. For larger nuclei, however, no energy is released, because the nuclear force is short-range and cannot act across larger nuclei.

Fusion powers stars and produces virtually all elements in a process called nucleosynthesis. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 616 million metric tons of helium each second. The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.645% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an alpha particle or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.[18]

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, hydrogen. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be brought close enough such that the attractive nuclear force is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The strong force grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially ""fall"" into each other and the result is fusion; this is an exothermic process.[19]

Energy released in most nuclear reactions is much larger than in chemical reactions, because the binding energy that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds electrons to a nucleus. For example, the ionization energy gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is 13.6 eV—less than one-millionth of the 17.6 MeV released in the deuterium–tritium (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an energy density many times greater than nuclear fission; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though individual fission reactions are generally much more energetic than individual fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Via the mass–energy equivalence, fusion yields a 0.7% efficiency of reactant mass into energy. This can be only be exceeded by the extreme cases of the accretion process involving neutron stars or black holes, approaching 40% efficiency, and antimatter annihilation at 100% efficiency. (The complete conversion of one gram of matter would release 9×1013 joules of energy.)

An important fusion process is the stellar nucleosynthesis that powers stars, including the Sun. In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounts for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei. Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).

Around 1920, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper The Internal Constitution of the Stars.[20][21] At that time, the source of stellar energy was unknown; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation E = mc2. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy had not yet been discovered, nor even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity). Eddington's paper reasoned that:

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

The primary source of solar energy, and that of similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the proton–proton chain reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four protons into one alpha particle, with the release of two positrons and two neutrinos (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the CNO cycle and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs when a more massive star undergoes a violent supernova at the end of its life, a process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.

A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive electrostatic force between their positively charged protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can tunnel through coulomb forces.

When a nucleon such as a proton or neutron is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbors due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an inverse-square force, so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from all the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.

The net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements iron and nickel, and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the binding energy becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of binding energy per nucleon, are 62Ni, 58Fe, 56Fe, and 60Ni.[22] Even though the nickel isotope, 62Ni, is more stable, the iron isotope 56Fe is an order of magnitude more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create 62Ni through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the helium-4 nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of lithium, the next heavier element. This is because protons and neutrons are fermions, which according to the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a doubly magic nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states. Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the alpha particle.

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong attractive nuclear force can take over and overcome the repulsive electrostatic force. This can also be described as the nuclei overcoming the so-called Coulomb barrier. The kinetic energy to achieve this can be lower than the barrier itself because of quantum tunneling.

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A diproton is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using deuterium–tritium fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1 MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen is 13.6 eV. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable 5He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1 MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining 4He nucleus is 3.5 MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6 MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.

The reaction cross section (σ) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross-section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted ⟨σv⟩. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is ⟨σv⟩ times the product of the reactant number densities:

 increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of 10–100 keV. At these temperatures, well above typical ionization energies (13.6 eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a plasma state.

The significance of

 as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy confinement time is found by considering the Lawson criterion. This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.[23][24]

Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atomic nuclei combining or ""fusing"" using high temperatures to drive them close enough together for this to become possible. Such temperatures cause the matter to become a plasma and, if confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: uncontrolled, in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in thermonuclear weapons (""hydrogen bombs"") and in most stars; and controlled, where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy. After reaching sufficient temperature, given by the Lawson criterion, the energy of accidental collisions within the plasma is high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier and the particles may fuse together.

In a deuterium–tritium fusion reaction, for example, the energy necessary to overcome the Coulomb barrier is 0.1 MeV. Converting between energy and temperature shows that the 0.1 MeV barrier would be overcome at a temperature in excess of 1.2 billion kelvin.

There are two effects that are needed to lower the actual temperature. One is the fact that temperature is the average kinetic energy, implying that some nuclei at this temperature would actually have much higher energy than 0.1 MeV, while others would be much lower. It is the nuclei in the high-energy tail of the velocity distribution that account for most of the fusion reactions. The other effect is quantum tunnelling. The nuclei do not actually have to have enough energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier completely. If they have nearly enough energy, they can tunnel through the remaining barrier. For these reasons fuel at lower temperatures will still undergo fusion events, at a lower rate.

Thermonuclear fusion is one of the methods being researched in the attempts to produce fusion power. If thermonuclear fusion becomes favorable to use, it would significantly reduce the world's carbon footprint.

Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions.[25]

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes.[citation needed] The system can be arranged to accelerate ions into a static fuel-infused target, known as beam–target fusion, or by accelerating two streams of ions towards each other, beam–beam fusion.[citation needed] The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross-sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.[citation needed]

A number of attempts to recirculate the ions that ""miss"" collisions have been made over the years. One of the better-known attempts in the 1970s was Migma, which used a unique particle storage ring to capture ions into circular orbits and return them to the reaction area. Theoretical calculations made during funding reviews pointed out that the system would have significant difficulty scaling up to contain enough fusion fuel to be relevant as a power source. In the 1990s, a new arrangement using a field-reversed configuration (FRC) as the storage system was proposed by Norman Rostoker and continues to be studied by TAE Technologies as of 2021[update]. A closely related approach is to merge two FRC's rotating in opposite directions,[26] which is being actively studied by Helion Energy. Because these approaches all have ion energies well beyond the Coulomb barrier, they often suggest the use of alternative fuel cycles like p-11B that are too difficult to attempt using conventional approaches.[27]

Muon-catalyzed fusion is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by Steven Jones in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create muons, their short 2.2 μs half-life, and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new alpha particle and thus stop catalyzing fusion.[28]

Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

The key problem in achieving thermonuclear fusion is how to confine the hot plasma. Due to the high temperature, the plasma cannot be in direct contact with any solid material, so it has to be located in a vacuum. Also, high temperatures imply high pressures. The plasma tends to expand immediately and some force is necessary to act against it. This force can take one of three forms: gravitation in stars, magnetic forces in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, or inertial as the fusion reaction may occur before the plasma starts to expand, so the plasma's inertia is keeping the material together.

One force capable of confining the fuel well enough to satisfy the Lawson criterion is gravity. The mass needed, however, is so great that gravitational confinement is only found in stars—the least massive stars capable of sustained fusion are red dwarfs, while brown dwarfs are able to fuse deuterium and lithium if they are of sufficient mass. In stars heavy enough, after the supply of hydrogen is exhausted in their cores, their cores (or a shell around the core) start fusing helium to carbon. In the most massive stars (at least 8–11 solar masses), the process is continued until some of their energy is produced by fusing lighter elements to iron. As iron has one of the highest binding energies, reactions producing heavier elements are generally endothermic. Therefore, significant amounts of heavier elements are not formed during stable periods of massive star evolution, but are formed in supernova explosions. Some lighter stars also form these elements in the outer parts of the stars over long periods of time, by absorbing energy from fusion in the inside of the star, by absorbing neutrons that are emitted from the fusion process.

All of the elements heavier than iron have some potential energy to release, in theory. At the extremely heavy end of element production, these heavier elements can produce energy in the process of being split again back toward the size of iron, in the process of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission thus releases energy that has been stored, sometimes billions of years before, during stellar nucleosynthesis.

Electrically charged particles (such as fuel ions) will follow magnetic field lines (see Guiding centre). The fusion fuel can therefore be trapped using a strong magnetic field. A variety of magnetic configurations exist, including the toroidal geometries of tokamaks and stellarators and open-ended mirror confinement systems.

A third confinement principle is to apply a rapid pulse of energy to a large part of the surface of a pellet of fusion fuel, causing it to simultaneously ""implode"" and heat to very high pressure and temperature. If the fuel is dense enough and hot enough, the fusion reaction rate will be high enough to burn a significant fraction of the fuel before it has dissipated. To achieve these extreme conditions, the initially cold fuel must be explosively compressed. Inertial confinement is used in the hydrogen bomb, where the driver is x-rays created by a fission bomb. Inertial confinement is also attempted in ""controlled"" nuclear fusion, where the driver is a laser, ion, or electron beam, or a Z-pinch. Another method is to use conventional high explosive material to compress a fuel to fusion conditions.[37][38] The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centred and focused hemispherical implosions[39] to generate neutrons from D-D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved to be in a predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium-oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko compressor,[40] where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere.[41]

There are also electrostatic confinement fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low due to competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation.[42] Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device,[43] a Penning trap and the polywell.[44] The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.

The most well known Inertial electrostatic confinement approach is the fusor. Starting in 1999, a number of amateurs have been able to do amateur fusion using these homemade devices.[45][46][47][48] Other IEC devices include: the Polywell, MIX POPS[49] and Marble concepts.[50]

At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores, the rates of fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (T ≈ 15 MK) and density (160 g/cm3), the energy release rate is only 276 μW/cm3—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat.[51] Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature, and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−E/kT)), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher than in stellar interiors: T ≈ (0.1–1.0)×109 K.

In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and tritium breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as aneutronic.

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:[52][53]

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D–6Li reaction has no advantage compared to p+–115B because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through 21D–21D side reactions. There is also a p+–73Li reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when Ti > 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a p+–94Be reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but 94Be can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to ""breed"" tritium in ""dry"" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the Castle Bravo fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo ""Shrimp"" had understood the usefulness of 6Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that 7Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While 7Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.[54] The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the nuclear cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that ⟨σv⟩/T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to ⟨σv⟩/T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is ""ignited"" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of ⟨σv⟩/T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with 31T and 32He creates some 21D, which is then possible to use in the 21D–32He reaction if the energies are ""right"". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The 32He from reaction (8) can react with 63Li in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,[citation needed] but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a Maxwellian plasma is not appropriate.

Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of fusion power production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products Efus, the energy of the charged fusion products Ech, and the atomic number Z of the non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the 21D–21D reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the 31T and 32He products. 31T burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The 21D–32He reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum 21D–21D temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the 31T but not the 32He gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

For calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D–D step), we count the 21D–21D fusion energy per D–D reaction as Efus = (4.03 MeV + 17.6 MeV) × 50% + (3.27 MeV) × 50% = 12.5 MeV and the energy in charged particles as Ech = (4.03 MeV + 3.5 MeV) × 50% + (0.82 MeV) × 50% = 4.2 MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,[68] so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0 MeV (a specific energy of about 225 million MJ per kilogram of deuterium).

Another unique aspect of the 21D–21D reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions

The last column is the neutronicity of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (Efus − Ech)/Efus. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(Z + 1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of ⟨σv⟩/T2. On the other hand, because the 21D–21D reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a ""penalty"" of 2/(Z + 1) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however, discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a ""hot ion mode"", the ""penalty"" would not apply.) There is at the same time a ""bonus"" of a factor 2 for 21D–21D because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

The maximum value of ⟨σv⟩/T2 is taken from a previous table. The ""penalty/bonus"" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column ""inverse reactivity"" are found by dividing 1.24×10−24 by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the 21D–31T reaction under comparable conditions. The column ""Lawson criterion"" weights these results with Ech and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the 21D–31T reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled ""power density"" and weights the practical reactivity by Efus. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the 21D–31T reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with electrons that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk electrical charge and form a plasma. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit x-ray radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as Bremsstrahlung.

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be opaque to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be optically thin for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.

The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain for some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the fusion triple product. This will not change the optimum operating point for 21D–31T very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to 21D–31T is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For 21D–21D and 21D–32He, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For 32He–32He, p+–63Li and p+–115B the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma have been considered but rejected.[69][70] This limitation does not apply to non-neutral and anisotropic plasmas; however, these have their own challenges to contend with.

In a classical picture, nuclei can be understood as hard spheres that repel each other through the Coulomb force but fuse once the two spheres come close enough for contact. Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:

This would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a Boltzmann distribution with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is 




10

290




{\displaystyle 10^{-290}}

, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.

The probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the de Broglie wavelength as well as quantum tunneling through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the cross section, which describes the probability that particles will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction. An estimation of the fusion cross-sectional area is often broken into three pieces:

{\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{geometry}}}

 is the geometric cross section, T is the barrier transparency and R is the reaction characteristics of the reaction.

More detailed forms of the cross-section can be derived through nuclear physics-based models and R-matrix theory.

The Naval Research Lab's plasma physics formulary[71] gives the total cross section in barns as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:

Bosch-Hale[72] also reports a R-matrix calculated cross sections fitting observation data with Padé rational approximating coefficients. With energy in units of keV and cross sections in units of millibarn, the factor has the form:

In fusion systems that are in thermal equilibrium, the particles are in a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, meaning the particles have a range of energies centered around the plasma temperature. The sun, magnetically confined plasmas and inertial confinement fusion systems are well modeled to be in thermal equilibrium. In these cases, the value of interest is the fusion cross-section averaged across the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

Great to see you all here today. Let's start with a quick round of introductions before we dive into today's objectives.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Morning, everyone. I'm Jane Doe, focusing on energy policy and sustainability.

>>Astrophysicist: Hello everyone! I'm Dr. Johnson, an astrophysicist interested in harnessing star power on Earth.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Hi all, I'm Alex Brown, working on engineering challenges for fusion reactors.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Great intros! Now let's outline today's objectives—discuss recent advancements in nuclear fusion technology and their potential impacts across various fields. 
 >>Fusion Technology Engineer: Let's break it down. From an engineering standpoint, the recent breakthrough at the US National Ignition Facility is huge. Achieving break-even fusion with 3.15 MJ output means we've produced as much energy as we put into starting the reaction—a major milestone.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Absolutely! This breakthrough could significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help achieve sustainability goals, but we need to adapt our policy frameworks quickly to support commercialization.

>>Astrophysicist: And maintaining a 90 million degree plasma for six minutes in the WEST reactor is like harnessing a fragment of the Sun's core right here on Earth! It's fascinating and opens up new research possibilities.

>>Nuclear Physicist: These advancements are critical milestones in our quest for sustainable energy. But let's not forget ITER's role in pushing magnetic confinement fusion boundaries. With its construction phase nearing completion—

>>Astrophysicist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in—didn't they just announce another milestone last week? Something about achieving first plasma?

>>Nuclear Physicist: Yes! Exactly! ITER achieved first plasma recently which marks another significant step forward.

>>Energy Policy Expert: From a policy standpoint, these advancements are crucial. We need to think about how these breakthroughs will change our energy policies and what regulations we'll need to keep things safe and sustainable.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: And let's not forget ITER's role in pushing those boundaries further. It's amazing that we're getting closer to replicating stellar processes here on Earth with these advancements.

>>Astrophysicist: Imagine harnessing star power for sustainable energy! These developments aren't just about pushing boundaries; they represent a monumental leap in our ability to replicate stellar processes on Earth. 
 >>Nuclear Physicist: Yeah, Harkins proposed nuclear fusion way back in 1915, and Eddington suggested hydrogen-helium fusion as stars' energy source in 1921. Their work really set the stage for everything that followed.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Exactly! And then the Greenhouse Item test in '51 showed we could actually control these reactions. That was a real game-changer for fusion technology.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That's a great point about the Greenhouse Item test paving the way for future research. It also had huge implications for our energy policies, showing us that sustainable energy solutions were within reach.

>>Astrophysicist: Absolutely! And Bethe's work in the late 1930s really set the stage for understanding how we could harness that power here on Earth. His contributions to nuclear fusion in stars were monumental.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Without those foundational works by Harkins, Eddington, and Bethe, we wouldn't be discussing sustainable fusion energy today. Their research has shaped our current energy policies significantly.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: To put it simply, yeah, without the breakthrough from 1951 showing us that controlled thermonuclear reactions were possible, we wouldn't have ITER or the National Ignition Facility today.

>>Nuclear Physicist: In essence, all these historical milestones have been crucial. They laid down the groundwork for our understanding and advancements in both stellar and controlled nuclear fusion.

>>Astrophysicist: You know what? The Greenhouse Item test wasn't just a scientific breakthrough but also demonstrated how feasible controlled thermonuclear reactions are. This experiment paved the way for advancements like ITER and NIF. 
 >>Nuclear Physicist: One big challenge is getting positively charged nuclei close enough to fuse because they repel each other strongly. We need a lot of energy for this. Methods like magnetic confinement in tokamaks or inertial confinement using lasers are being explored to achieve the necessary conditions.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: It's like trying to keep jelly from wobbling on a plate when maintaining plasma stability in a tokamak. We need to address issues like plasma instabilities and material limitations.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That's an interesting point about plasma stability. How do you think new materials could help with this?

>>Astrophysicist: Imagine, in the vastness of space, stars naturally overcome the Coulomb barrier through immense gravitational forces and temperatures. If we could mimic those stellar conditions more closely, advanced magnetic confinement techniques or even new materials might help us achieve this.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Fundamentally, it's like trying to contain a sun within a magnetic bottle. Achieving stable fusion requires not only overcoming the Coulomb barrier but also keeping high-temperature plasmas stable. Advanced materials and innovative magnetic configurations could indeed help us mimic stellar conditions more closely.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Exactly! Plasma instabilities are a major hurdle. If we develop more advanced materials that can withstand extreme conditions, we'd be closer to solving this puzzle.

>>Energy Policy Expert: And from a policy standpoint, we must ensure our infrastructure can support these advancements sustainably. We also need to consider how these technological advancements will impact existing energy policies and regulations.

>>Astrophysicist: Harnessing star-like conditions here on Earth could be revolutionary. Advanced techniques or new materials might just be what we need! What if superconducting magnets were part of our solution? 
 >>Nuclear Physicist: The concept of superconducting magnets is indeed promising. However, we must also consider the challenges associated with maintaining plasma stability in such high-energy environments. Both magnetic confinement in tokamaks and inertial confinement using lasers have their unique advantages and limitations.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Let's break it down. From an engineering standpoint, magnetic confinement in tokamaks is like trying to hold jelly with rubber bands. The plasma's always wriggling and squirming, making stability a real challenge. Inertial confinement using lasers offers a more controlled environment but requires precise synchronization and immense energy input.

>>Energy Policy Expert: We must consider long-term sustainability here. While both methods show promise, their energy demands are substantial. Evaluating which approach can be scaled efficiently with minimal environmental impact is essential for sustainable development.

>>Astrophysicist: Indeed, and we should also explore how advancements in material science could mitigate some of these challenges, potentially making one method more viable than the other.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Fundamentally, achieving successful plasma confinement lies in balancing the magnetic fields and plasma pressure. Tokamaks offer a promising approach with their toroidal magnetic fields, but we should also consider alternative methods like stellarators which aim to provide more stable configurations.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Exactly! And speaking of materials handling extreme conditions—Nuclear Physicist, do you think current advancements in material science are sufficient?

>>Nuclear Physicist: We're making progress, but there's still a long way to go. Tokamaks need materials that can handle neutron bombardment and extreme heat without degrading.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That's a good point. We also need to think about the economic feasibility of developing these advanced materials on a large scale.

>>Astrophysicist: It's really tough to match the stability and efficiency that stars naturally have. On Earth, replicating this with magnetic fields or intense laser pulses presents significant challenges.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: To put it simply, implementing these methods is a balancing act. Magnetic confinement needs advanced materials for extreme conditions while inertial confinement requires precise synchronization and immense energy input. 
 >>Energy Policy Expert: We need to ensure that private investments are not only incentivized but also directed towards sustainable practices. What specific policies could help us achieve this balance?

>>Nuclear Physicist: Well, one approach could be tax incentives for companies investing in sustainable fusion research. This would encourage innovation while ensuring environmental standards are met.

>>Astrophysicist: That's a good point. Instead of just focusing on the potential, we should look at practical steps. For instance, setting clear regulatory guidelines can help direct investments towards environmentally responsible projects.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Absolutely, and building on that, what about economic feasibility? How do we make sure these advanced materials and methods are cost-effective?

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: From an engineering perspective, funding is crucial for developing materials that can withstand extreme conditions. Without this support, achieving sustained plasma stability remains a challenge.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Exactly. It's about finding a balance between technical feasibility and economic viability. We need to make sure private investments advance fusion technology in a cost-effective way.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Right, so how do we ensure these investments are both incentivized and sustainable?

>>Astrophysicist: Policies could include grants or subsidies for research into sustainable practices. This would help channel private investments into areas that meet strict environmental standards.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: And don't forget public-private partnerships. They can leverage governmental oversight with private sector innovation to balance these interests effectively.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That's an excellent point! Public-private partnerships could indeed provide a balanced approach by leveraging both governmental oversight and private sector innovation.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Absolutely! These partnerships could help mitigate risks while ensuring compliance with environmental standards.

>>Astrophysicist: If governments collaborate with tech companies, it would streamline efforts towards our common goal of sustainable fusion energy. 
 >>Energy Policy Expert: We need to think about how to create an environment that encourages these collaborations. What specific incentives or regulatory changes do you think would be most effective in driving private investment towards sustainable fusion energy?

>>Nuclear Physicist: Well, we need to show that this technology works and is cost-effective. Achieving break-even or net-positive energy output is crucial. What new tech do you think will get investors excited?

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Let's break it down. From an engineering standpoint, the key advancements include high-efficiency superconducting magnets for better plasma confinement, advanced materials capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and radiation, and improved laser systems for inertial confinement fusion. These innovations can significantly reduce operational costs and enhance reactor performance.

>>Astrophysicist: I agree with what you said about high-efficiency magnets, but we also need to consider how we can harness the natural optimization processes of stars to improve our reactor designs. Stars have evolved over billions of years to achieve efficient fusion. How can we use advanced magnetic confinement techniques similar to those found in stellarators to enhance plasma stability?

>>Energy Policy Expert: Right, but how can we ensure these technological advancements are not only feasible but also sustainable long-term? What policies or incentives could support the development and deployment of these advanced materials and systems?

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: To put it simply, we need practical implementation. Ensuring that these advanced materials and systems are developed and tested rigorously in real-world conditions is key. For example, ITER's recent success with their superconducting magnets shows promise. What testing protocols or pilot projects would be most effective in demonstrating their viability?

>>Nuclear Physicist: You know, from my experience, regulatory support is crucial for these technologies. We should look at successful case studies like Helion Energy's progress in the private sector. They’ve been able to attract significant investment by showing clear milestones.

>>Astrophysicist: That's an interesting point about Helion Energy; they’ve made strides using innovative approaches like field-reversed configuration for plasma containment. How do you think we can apply such practical examples more broadly across the industry?

>>Energy Policy Expert: Hmm... How can we ensure these advancements are sustainable long-term? What policies or incentives could support this development?

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Exactly! We need rigorous testing in real-world conditions. Which testing protocols or pilot projects do you think would best demonstrate their viability? 
 >>Energy Policy Expert: We need to make sure our pilot projects fit with our sustainability goals. How are we planning to handle any regulatory issues?

>>Nuclear Physicist: Good point. We should start by collaborating with regulatory bodies early on and use new materials and techniques to make this work better.

>>Astrophysicist: And let's not forget the long-term implications of these technologies. If we can harness the processes that power stars, we need to ensure they align with both our technological goals and sustainability objectives.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Exactly. Rigorous real-world testing is crucial. For instance, we could test new materials in smaller reactors first before scaling up.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Absolutely! And what about economic viability? How can we ensure that's considered at every step?

>>Nuclear Physicist: We need a holistic approach—addressing both technical feasibility and broader sustainability concerns simultaneously. Maybe we can look into cost-benefit analyses for each phase of the project.

>>Astrophysicist: Right, if we're truly replicating stellar processes, balancing immediate technological needs with long-term environmental impacts is key. What strategies can we employ to maintain this balance?

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Incremental improvements based on test results might be a good strategy rather than aiming for perfection right away. This way, we can adapt as needed without losing sight of our goals.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That makes sense. Let's also consider how we'll navigate potential regulatory hurdles as we move forward.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Agreed, it's vital that our approach remains comprehensive—addressing both technical feasibility and broader sustainability concerns simultaneously.

>>Astrophysicist: Yeah, imagine if every step forward in technology also brought us closer to sustainable practices. That's where true innovation lies—in harmonizing progress with responsibility. 
 >>Energy Policy Expert: Well, we've had a really productive discussion today. Thanks, everyone, for your valuable contributions. Let's outline our action items: first, we'll draft a policy framework to support fusion technology development; second, we'll identify key stakeholders for collaboration; and finally, we'll schedule a follow-up meeting in two weeks to review progress.

>>Nuclear Physicist: Um, I agree. It's crucial we get the policy framework right from the start. I'll take the lead on drafting it and ensure it aligns with our sustainability goals and regulatory requirements.

>>Energy Policy Expert: That sounds great! Do you need any specific data from us?

>>Nuclear Physicist: Yes, actually some recent reports would be helpful.

>>Astrophysicist: You know, I'm really excited about this next phase. I'll work on identifying potential stakeholders who can help us balance technological advancements with environmental impacts.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Uh, sounds good. I'll focus on setting up the smaller reactors for real-world testing and making sure we have a solid plan for incremental improvements based on those results.

>>Energy Policy Expert: Great! So just to recap—I'll handle the policy framework draft; you'll identify stakeholders; and you'll set up the testing phase. We'll reconvene in two weeks to check our progress. Anything else before we wrap up?

>>Nuclear Physicist: No, that covers everything from my end.

>>Astrophysicist: Same here. Looking forward to seeing how things develop.

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Yeah, let's get started then!

>>Energy Policy Expert: Perfect! Thanks again, everyone. See you all in two weeks!

>>Astrophysicist: Have a great week ahead!

>>Fusion Technology Engineer: Looking forward to seeing everyone's progress!"
