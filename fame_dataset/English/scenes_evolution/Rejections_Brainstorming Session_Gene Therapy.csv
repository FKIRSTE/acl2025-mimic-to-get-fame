The summary indicates that the scene should include brief greetings, acknowledgment of shared expertise, and setting expectations for open dialogue and creative thinking. However, the transcript jumps directly into detailed discussions about gene therapy, ethical implications, clinical trials, and technical challenges without any opening greetings or setting the tone for a collaborative brainstorming session. While the content is rich and relevant to gene therapy, it misses the core requirements of Scene 1 as described in the summary."
