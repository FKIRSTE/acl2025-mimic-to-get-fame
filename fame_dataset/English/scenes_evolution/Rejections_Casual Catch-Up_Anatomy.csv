However, there is significant repetition in the dialogue, particularly from the Medical Historian and Anatomist, which detracts from the natural flow and engagement of the conversation. While the core requirement of sharing personal thoughts and experiences is met, the excessive repetition makes the scene feel less coherent and engaging. To improve, participants should avoid repeating the same points multiple times and instead introduce new anecdotes or insights to keep the discussion dynamic."
