Additionally, next steps for continued collaboration or follow-up meetings should be outlined. The transcript does cover several essential elements such as integrating sustainability measures into space policy, technical feasibility of innovations, environmental protection standards, commercial viability, and international collaboration. However, the dialogue is highly repetitive with multiple instances of similar statements from the Aerospace Engineer and Space Policy Analyst. While these points are important, they overshadow other perspectives and make the conversation less engaging. The scene lacks a clear summarization of key ideas and prioritization of concepts based on group consensus. There is also no mention of outlining next steps for continued collaboration or follow-up meetings. To improve this scene, participants should focus on summarizing diverse viewpoints succinctly, prioritize actionable concepts collectively, and clearly outline future steps to ensure a coherent closing discussion."
