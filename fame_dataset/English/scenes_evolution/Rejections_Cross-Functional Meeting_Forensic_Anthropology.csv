Have you considered how these methods might also reveal subtle skeletal abnormalities that traditional methods could miss?","The scene transcript does cover the essential elements from the summary, such as the collaboration between forensic anthropologists and pathologists, the importance in mass fatality incidents, challenges due to decomposition or destruction, and applications in conflict zones. However, there is excessive repetition of certain points, particularly from the forensic anthropologist and legal expert. This makes the dialogue feel unnatural and redundant. While some repetition can emphasize key points, this level detracts from the overall coherence and engagement of the scene. To improve, participants should focus on diversifying their contributions and ensuring a more dynamic interaction that still covers all core requirements."
