>>North-South Research Partnership Coordinator: Hi everyone! It's great to be here with such a diverse group. Let's make sure we're integrating perspectives from both the Global North and South in our objectives.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive greetings.
   **Reasoning:** Each participant begins with a similar greeting, which feels redundant and unnatural in a typical meeting setting. In real meetings, participants usually greet each other once at the beginning and then move on to the agenda.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Consolidate the greetings into one initial statement by the Policy Maker and have other participants directly address their points.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The language used by each participant is very formal and structured, which can feel unrealistic for a casual or semi-formal meeting environment. Real conversations often include more relaxed and varied expressions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language to make the dialogue feel natural. For example, instead of ""As we begin, let's ensure our objectives are clear,"" use ""Let's make sure we're all on the same page about our goals.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between participants.
   **Reasoning:** Each participant's statement is isolated without any acknowledgment or response to previous comments, which is uncommon in real meetings where people build on each other's points.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include some interactions or responses that show participants are listening to each other and engaging in a dialogue.

4. **Issue Description:** Redundant focus on objectives.
   **Reasoning:** Every speaker reiterates the need to outline objectives, which becomes repetitive and unnecessary after the first few mentions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** After the initial mention of objectives by the Policy Maker, subsequent speakers should focus on specific aspects or suggestions related to those objectives rather than repeating the need for them.

5. **Issue Description:** Uniform structure of statements.
   **Reasoning:** Each participant follows a similar structure in their statements (greeting + objective mention), making it feel formulaic rather than dynamic.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Vary the structure of statements to reflect different speaking styles and priorities. For instance, one speaker might start with an anecdote or question instead of a greeting.

   **Suggested Improvement:** Remove or revise this comment to add value to the discussion. For example: ""It's clear that our interdisciplinary approach is crucial for tackling these complex issues effectively.""

5. **Issue Description:** Lack of natural pauses or fillers in speech.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic conversations often include natural pauses, fillers (like 'um' or 'you know'), and less structured sentences.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Add some natural speech elements to make the dialogue flow more realistically. For example:
   - Human Security Expert: ""Um, think about it—when communities feel secure...""",">>Development Studies Professor: You know, the interdisciplinary nature of development studies is crucial.

>>Development Studies Professor: Indeed! The interdisciplinary nature of development studies equips graduates with a unique skill set that's highly valued across various sectors. To elaborate—

>>Policy Maker: Sorry to interrupt, Professor. Could you clarify what you mean by ""interdisciplinary nature""? Are we talking about combining different academic fields or something else?

   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses very formal and structured language that feels more like written text than spoken conversation. Phrases like ""plethora of career paths,"" ""significant opportunities for impact and growth,"" and ""substantial resources and networks"" are overly polished for a typical meeting discussion.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Use more casual, conversational language to make the dialogue feel more natural. For example, instead of ""graduates in development studies have a plethora of career paths available to them,"" say ""graduates in development studies have many different career options.""

2. **Issue Description:** Repetitive emphasis on the benefits of interdisciplinary skills.
   - **Reasoning:** Both the Economic Development Consultant and Development Studies Professor emphasize the versatility and employability of graduates due to their interdisciplinary skills, which feels redundant.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Combine these points or have one speaker acknowledge the other's statement before adding new information. For example, the Professor could say, ""As mentioned earlier, our graduates' interdisciplinary skills make them highly versatile...""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between speakers.
   - **Reasoning:** Each speaker delivers their point without much engagement with others' statements, making it feel like a series of monologues rather than a dynamic discussion.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Include more interactive elements such as questions, agreements, or follow-up comments to create a sense of dialogue. For instance, after the NGO Representative speaks, another participant could ask about specific projects they've worked on.

4. **Issue Description:** Unnatural interruption by Policy Maker.
   - **Reasoning:** The interruption by the Policy Maker is abrupt and lacks politeness typically seen in professional settings.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Make the interruption smoother by adding polite phrases. For example: ""Excuse me for interrupting, Professor, but could you clarify what you mean by 'interdisciplinary nature'?""

5. **Issue Description:** Excessive jargon without explanation.
   - **Reasoning:** Terms like ""human security"" and ""Global North and South"" are used without sufficient context or explanation for all participants to understand clearly.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Provide brief explanations or examples when using specialized terms to ensure clarity for all attendees. For instance: ""Human security refers to protecting individuals from threats such as violence or poverty...""

6. **Issue Description:** Lack of personal anecdotes or examples.
   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue is heavy on general statements but lacks personal stories or specific examples that would make it more engaging and relatable.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Incorporate personal experiences or specific case studies related to each speaker's point. For example: ""In my experience working with NGOs in rural areas...""

By addressing these issues, the meeting scene will become more realistic and engaging for readers familiar with English-speaking professional environments.",">>Economic Development Consultant: Um, according to the data, graduates in development studies have many different career options.
