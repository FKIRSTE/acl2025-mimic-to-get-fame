The summary indicates that the scene should include a brief welcome, an overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes, and a mention of the importance of creative thinking and collaboration. However, the transcript dives directly into detailed discussions about infectious diseases, early detection, containment strategies, and advanced surveillance systems without any opening greetings or setting the stage for a brainstorming session. The core requirements from the summary are missing, making it necessary to reshoot the scene with proper introductions and context setting."

The summary indicates that the scene should include summarizing key takeaways, outlining action items or follow-up tasks, and thanking participants for their contributions. However, the transcript is repetitive and lacks these elements. It repeatedly discusses securing funding and international cooperation without providing a clear recap of main points, specific action items, or any form of gratitude towards participants. To improve this scene, ensure that the dialogue includes a concise summary of key points discussed earlier in the conversation, clearly outlines next steps or tasks to be followed up on, and ends with a note of thanks to all participants for their input."
