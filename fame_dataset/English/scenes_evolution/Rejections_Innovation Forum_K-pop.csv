The summary indicates that the scene should include a brief welcome, setting the tone for the forum, an overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes, and encouragement for spontaneous contributions. However, the transcript jumps directly into a detailed discussion about K-pop without any greeting or setting of context. While the content is rich and relevant to K-pop, it lacks the necessary opening elements specified in the summary. The dialogue is repetitive and lacks structure, making it difficult to follow. To improve this scene, participants should start with a clear greeting, outline the objectives of their discussion on K-pop's evolution and impact, and encourage each other to share their insights spontaneously."

>>Music Industry Analyst: So, isn't it interesting how the major companies like SM, YG, JYP, and Hybe dominate the industry? They have such a tight grip on everything from production to marketing. But um, there's been a shift towards greater artist autonomy recently. Have you ever wondered if this could lead to more creative freedom for idols?
>>Entertainment Journalist: Listen, the dominance of these major companies like SM, YG, JYP, and Hybe is undeniable. But isn't it amazing how this shift towards greater artist autonomy could potentially shake things up? I mean, can you believe the kind of creative freedom idols might get? Wow!
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Indeed! From a cultural perspective, the dominance of these major companies has historically shaped the industry, but it's important to consider how greater artist autonomy might influence societal norms. What does this signify for the future of K-pop and its global impact?
>>Music Industry Analyst: Well, it's fascinating how the shift towards greater artist autonomy is not just a trend but backed by data. For instance, recent surveys show that idols with more creative control report higher satisfaction and engagement levels. So, could this lead to a new era where creativity thrives over commercialism?
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Fundamentally, the shift towards greater artist autonomy is a significant cultural evolution. Historically speaking, K-pop has been tightly controlled by major companies, which has shaped societal norms around idol behavior and creativity. How can we interpret this change in terms of its potential impact on both the domestic and international perception of K-pop?

To improve this scene, participants should start with a brief welcome, introduce themselves, provide an overview of what will be discussed during the forum, and encourage each other to contribute spontaneously throughout the conversation."
