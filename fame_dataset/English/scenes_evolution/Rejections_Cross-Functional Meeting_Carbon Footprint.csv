While there are repeated mentions of tailored strategies and actionable steps, the dialogue is highly repetitive and lacks a coherent structure. There is no clear summary of key points discussed, nor a concise outline of actionable next steps. Additionally, there is no brief off-topic moment sharing personal anecdotes or reflections to add depth to the conversation. The scene needs more variety in dialogue and a clearer focus on summarizing discussions and outlining next steps."
