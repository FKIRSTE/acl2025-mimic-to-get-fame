What are the long-term impacts on our ecosystems if we don't adopt sustainable practices urgently?
>>Cultural Anthropologist: From a cultural perspective, globalization has woven a complex tapestry of interconnected societies. While it fosters cross-cultural exchanges, it also magnifies social inequalities and environmental degradation. What does this mean for our efforts to create sustainable and equitable global practices?
>>Economist: From an economic standpoint, the bottom line is that globalization has led to significant economic growth but also widened social inequalities. How does this impact global trade and the distribution of wealth?

How can we leverage international trade policies to foster equitable growth and reduce these gaps?","The summary outlines three core elements: sociologist reflecting on social disparities, environmental scientist emphasizing ecological footprint concerns, and group brainstorming sustainable practices. The transcript includes discussions on social inequalities from multiple perspectives (sociologist, cultural anthropologist, economist), environmental degradation (environmental scientist), and mentions of sustainable practices. However, the dialogue is repetitive and lacks a coherent structure for brainstorming solutions. While the essential elements are present, the scene needs more focus on collaborative brainstorming to meet the summary's intent fully."
