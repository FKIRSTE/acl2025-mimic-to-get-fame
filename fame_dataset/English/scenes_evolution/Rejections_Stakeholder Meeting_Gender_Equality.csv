The summary specifies that the scene should include a brief welcome by the host, quick greetings among participants, and an overview of meeting objectives. However, the transcript dives directly into discussions about gender equality, referencing Rwanda and Sweden as examples without any opening or greeting. While the content of the discussion is relevant to gender equality, it does not fulfill the core requirements of setting the tone for the meeting with a proper introduction and greetings. To improve this scene, participants should start with a welcoming statement from the host, followed by brief introductions or greetings among themselves before transitioning into the main discussion topics."
