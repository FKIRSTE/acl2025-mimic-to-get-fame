Justice must prevail in ensuring equal protection under the law for all citizens.

The summary specifies that the scene should include a brief greeting among participants, a quick acknowledgment of familiarity, and an outline of meeting objectives. However, the transcript dives directly into discussions about civil rights without any opening greetings or setting the tone for the meeting. While the content of the discussion is rich and relevant to civil rights, it fails to meet the core requirements of Scene 1 as outlined in the summary."
