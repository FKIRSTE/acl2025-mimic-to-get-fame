The core requirement of gathering feedback from stakeholders and allowing spontaneous discussion is not met. Instead, the dialogue is highly repetitive, with participants reiterating the same points multiple times without any natural evolution of topics or meaningful engagement. While the essential elements such as technical feasibility, robustness of algorithms, ethical considerations, and societal impact are mentioned, they are repeated verbatim without any new insights or depth being added to the conversation. This makes the dialogue incoherent and poorly structured. To improve this scene, participants should engage in a more dynamic discussion where they build on each other's points, introduce new ideas or concerns, and provide diverse perspectives that evolve naturally."
