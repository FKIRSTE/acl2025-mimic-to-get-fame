The summary indicates that the scene should include a brief greeting among participants, a quick check-in on how everyone is doing, and a brief overview of meeting objectives. However, the transcript dives directly into technical discussions about CRISPR-Cas9 and its implications at various levels (molecular, biochemical, genetic, computational) without any greetings or setting the tone for collaboration. While the content of the discussion is rich and relevant to molecular biology, it completely misses the core requirements of opening and greetings as outlined in the summary."

However, the dialogue is highly repetitive, with participants repeating the same points multiple times without adding new information or depth to the conversation. This makes the scene feel unnatural and poorly structured. To improve, participants should focus on building upon each other's ideas rather than reiterating them verbatim. Additionally, more spontaneous contributions and interactions would make the conversation more engaging and realistic."
