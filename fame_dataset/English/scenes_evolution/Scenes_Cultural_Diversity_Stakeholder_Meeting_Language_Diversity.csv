>>Sociolinguist: Definitely! And those traditions could offer valuable insights for modern pedagogical approaches.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive emphasis on embedding grammatical structures within narratives.
   **Reasoning:** The Linguist repeatedly mentions embedding grammatical structures within narratives, which feels redundant and overly formal for a typical meeting conversation. This repetition can make the dialogue seem unnatural.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Reduce the repetition by summarizing the point once and then moving on to other aspects of the discussion. For example: ""Integrating traditional storytelling methods into modern educational practices can leverage cognitive processes involved in narrative comprehension, enhancing engagement and aligning with natural language acquisition.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language used by multiple participants.
   **Reasoning:** Phrases like ""leveraging cognitive processes"" and ""embedding grammatical structures"" are quite formal and may not reflect the casual tone often found in meetings.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language to make the dialogue feel more natural. For example: ""Using stories to teach grammar can help students understand better because it feels more natural.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction or follow-up questions.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic meetings often involve participants asking questions or seeking clarification from each other, which is missing here.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include some interactive elements such as questions or requests for examples. For instance: ""Can you give an example of how we might use storytelling to teach grammar?""

4. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic enthusiasm without practical suggestions.
   **Reasoning:** While enthusiasm is good, realistic meetings often balance excitement with practical suggestions or concerns about implementation.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Add some practical considerations or challenges that might arise when implementing these strategies. For example: ""It's a great idea, but how do we ensure that all teachers are equipped to use storytelling effectively?""

5. **Issue Description:** Anthropologist's comment about cultural norms shaping behavior seems disconnected from previous points.
   **Reasoning:** The comment about cultural norms shaping behavior doesn't directly tie into the ongoing discussion about storytelling methods in education, making it feel out of place.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Connect this point more clearly to the topic at hand. For example: ""These stories embody cultural norms that shape behavior and attitudes towards learning, which can be integrated into our teaching methods.""

6. **Issue Description:** Sociolinguist's comment lacks depth compared to others' contributions.
   **Reasoning:** The Sociolinguist's comments are brief and don't add much depth compared to others' detailed explanations, making their contributions seem less substantial.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Expand on their points with more detail or examples. For instance: ""When kids hear stories from their elders, they learn not just the language but also social cues and values, which could be incorporated into classroom activities.""",">>Language Educator: Good morning, everyone!

>>Sociolinguist: Definitely! And those traditions could offer valuable insights for modern pedagogical approaches. Can you give an example of how we might use storytelling to teach grammar?

>>Language Educator: Sure thing! For instance, we could use folktales that incorporate various grammatical structures naturally within the narrative. But it's a great idea; how do we ensure that all teachers are equipped to use storytelling effectively?"
"
>>Linguist: Indeed! Our recent linguistic research has shown that storytelling can significantly enhance grammatical comprehension. By embedding complex syntactic structures within narratives, students can intuitively grasp grammar rules. What if we also consider incorporating multimodal elements like visual aids to support these stories?
>>Anthropologist: You see, from an anthropological perspective, storytelling isn't just about grammar. It's deeply rooted in cultural practices and traditions. For instance, in many indigenous cultures, stories are used to pass down knowledge and values. What if we incorporated these cultural narratives into our language education to make learning more meaningful?
>>Sociolinguist: Interestingly, social dynamics play a crucial role in how language is used and evolves within communities. For example, the way people interact in different social settings can influence their choice of words and expressions. What if we explored how incorporating storytelling from various social contexts could enhance students' understanding of language use?
>>Language Educator: Let's consider how we can make storytelling even more effective in language acquisition. Think about incorporating interactive elements like role-playing or group discussions based on the stories. This could help students engage more deeply and apply what they've learned in a practical context.
>>Linguist: To put it in perspective, our recent linguistic research indicates that incorporating multimodal elements like visual aids alongside storytelling can further enhance grammatical comprehension. This approach leverages the brain's ability to process information through multiple channels, making learning more intuitive and engaging.
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! And you know, incorporating cultural narratives can really enrich the learning experience. For example, in some African cultures, storytelling is used to teach moral lessons and community values. What if we included these stories to not only teach language but also foster a deeper understanding of different cultures?
>>Sociolinguist: You see, social dynamics are fascinating when it comes to language use. For instance, the way people adapt their speech in different social settings can reveal a lot about their relationships and societal norms. What if we included stories that highlight these variations to help students understand the practical applications of language?

This approach leverages the brain's ability to process information through multiple channels, making learning more intuitive and engaging.

>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! And you know, incorporating cultural narratives can really enrich the learning experience. For example—

>>Sociolinguist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—could you clarify what you mean by ""cultural narratives""? Are we talking about traditional folklore or contemporary stories as well?

>>Anthropologist: Great question! I was referring to both traditional folklore and contemporary stories that reflect cultural values and practices. For instance, um, in some African cultures, storytelling is used to teach moral lessons and community values.

>>Sociolinguist: Fascinating! You know, the way social dynamics influence language use is truly remarkable. In multilingual communities, code-switching often reflects social hierarchies and relationships. What if we included stories that showcase these interactions to help students grasp the practical implications of language in different social contexts?

>>Language Educator: Well, think about how we can make storytelling even more effective in language acquisition. What if we incorporated interactive elements like role-playing or group discussions based on the stories? This could help students engage more deeply and apply what they've learned in a practical context.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetition of the Linguist's point about multimodal elements.
   **Reasoning:** The Linguist repeats the same idea about incorporating multimodal elements like visual aids twice, which feels redundant and unnatural in a typical meeting setting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Remove the second instance of the Linguist's point to avoid repetition and maintain a natural flow of conversation.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language used by all participants.
   **Reasoning:** While professional meetings often involve formal language, the dialogue here is excessively formal and lacks the casual interjections or colloquial expressions that typically occur in real-life discussions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce more casual phrases or interjections to make the conversation feel more authentic. For example, ""I think"" instead of ""What if we,"" or adding phrases like ""you know"" or ""I guess.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of natural interruptions and overlaps.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic conversations often include interruptions, overlaps, and back-and-forth exchanges that are missing here. The dialogue flows too smoothly without any natural conversational dynamics.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Add some interruptions or overlapping dialogue to mimic real-life interactions better. For example, have one participant start speaking before another finishes their sentence.

4. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic politeness when interrupting.
   **Reasoning:** The Sociolinguist's interruption is overly polite and structured (""Sorry to jump in here—could you clarify what you mean by 'cultural narratives'?""). In real meetings, interruptions are usually less formal.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Make the interruption more casual and spontaneous. For example: ""Wait, can you explain what you mean by 'cultural narratives'? Are we talking folklore or modern stories?""

5. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of filler words like ""um.""
   **Reasoning:** While filler words are common in speech, their overuse can make dialogue feel forced rather than naturally occurring hesitation.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Reduce the number of filler words to strike a balance between natural pauses and clear communication.

6. **Issue Description:** Repetition of Language Educator's suggestion about interactive elements.
   **Reasoning:** The Language Educator repeats their suggestion about role-playing and group discussions almost verbatim towards the end of the scene, which feels redundant.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Combine both instances into one comprehensive statement earlier in the conversation to avoid repetition.

7. **Issue Description:** Lack of personal anecdotes or examples from participants' experiences.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic meetings often include personal anecdotes or specific examples that participants draw from their own experiences to support their points.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include brief personal anecdotes or specific examples related to storytelling in language education from each participant’s experience.

By addressing these issues, the meeting scene will become more realistic and engaging for readers familiar with English-speaking environments.",">>Linguist: Our recent research shows that storytelling can really boost grammatical comprehension. By embedding complex syntactic structures within narratives, students can intuitively grasp grammar rules. I think we should also consider using visual aids to support these stories.

>>Anthropologist: You know, from an anthropological perspective, storytelling isn't just about grammar. It's deeply rooted in cultural practices and traditions.

>>Language Educator: Let's think about how we can make storytelling even more effective in language acquisition. Maybe we could incorporate interactive elements like role-playing or group discussions based on the stories. This could help students engage more deeply and apply what they've learned practically.

>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! And you know, incorporating cultural narratives can really enrich the learning experience. For example—

>>Sociolinguist (interrupting): Wait, can you explain what you mean by ""cultural narratives""? Are we talking folklore or modern stories?

>>Anthropologist: Great question! I was referring to both traditional folklore and contemporary stories that reflect cultural values and practices. For instance, in some African cultures, storytelling is used to teach moral lessons and community values.

>>Sociolinguist: Fascinating! You know, the way social dynamics influence language use is truly remarkable. In multilingual communities, code-switching often reflects social hierarchies and relationships. What if we included stories that showcase these interactions to help students grasp the practical implications of language in different social contexts?

>>Language Educator: Actually, I've seen this work well with my students when we've done role-playing exercises based on stories from different cultures. They really get into it and start using new vocabulary naturally."
"
>>Sociolinguist: You see, it's fascinating how role-playing can mirror real-life social interactions. But what if we also considered incorporating more contemporary narratives? How do you think that might impact student engagement?
>>Linguist: To put it in perspective, incorporating contemporary narratives could indeed enhance student engagement by making the material more relatable. However, we must also consider the linguistic complexity and cultural relevance of these narratives to ensure they effectively contribute to language acquisition.
>>Anthropologist: Interestingly, incorporating contemporary narratives can indeed enhance engagement. But what if we also consider the cultural context of these stories? How do they reflect the values and norms of the students' communities?
>>Language Educator: Let's consider the practical application of these narratives. How can we ensure that teachers are equipped to integrate contemporary stories effectively into their lessons? I mean, it's not just about choosing the right stories but also about how they're presented.
>>Linguist: Indeed! From a linguistic standpoint, it's crucial to ensure that the narratives we incorporate are not only engaging but also linguistically rich. This means selecting stories that offer varied syntactic structures and vocabulary to challenge students and promote deeper language acquisition.
>>Anthropologist: You see, the cultural context of these contemporary narratives is crucial.

>>Sociolinguist: Right! And considering peer interactions during group activities could really boost engagement with these contemporary narratives.
>>Language Educator: Let's focus on equipping teachers with effective methods for integrating these stories into their lessons.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive content and ideas.
   - **Reasoning:** Multiple participants repeat the same points about contemporary narratives enhancing engagement, cultural relevance, linguistic richness, and teacher training without adding new insights or advancing the discussion.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Consolidate similar points to avoid redundancy. Each participant should build on previous comments or introduce new perspectives to keep the conversation dynamic.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses formal language that feels unnatural for a typical meeting setting where conversational tone is more common.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Use more casual and varied expressions to reflect natural speech patterns. For example, instead of ""incorporating contemporary narratives could indeed enhance student engagement,"" use ""I think using modern stories could really get students interested.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction and acknowledgment between participants.
   - **Reasoning:** Participants do not acknowledge each other's contributions or engage in back-and-forth dialogue, which is typical in real meetings.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Include phrases that show active listening and interaction, such as ""That's a great point,"" ""I agree with what you said,"" or ""Building on your idea...""

4. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of filler words like ""um"" and repetitive sentence structures.
   - **Reasoning:** While filler words are natural in speech, their excessive use here makes the dialogue feel forced rather than spontaneous.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Reduce the number of filler words and vary sentence structures to create a more fluid conversation.

5. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic repetition of complex terms without variation.
   - **Reasoning:** Terms like ""linguistically rich"" and ""cultural relevance"" are repeated verbatim by different speakers, which feels unnatural as people typically paraphrase or use synonyms in real conversations.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Encourage variety in expression by using synonyms or rephrasing ideas differently.

6. **Issue Description:** Lack of specific examples or practical suggestions.
   - **Reasoning:** The discussion remains abstract without concrete examples or actionable steps, which is uncommon in productive meetings focused on problem-solving.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce specific examples of contemporary narratives that could be used or practical methods for teacher training to make the conversation more grounded.

>>Sociolinguist: Exactly! But let's also think about power dynamics within these communities. If certain voices are consistently marginalized, how do we ensure equitable representation in our feedback process?","1. **Issue Description:** Repetition of ideas.
   **Reasoning:** The Anthropologist repeats the idea of incorporating local traditions and contemporary issues into narratives multiple times, which feels redundant and unnatural in a typical meeting setting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Consolidate the Anthropologist's points to avoid repetition. For example: ""Including community-specific festivals or historical events can make the stories more relatable and engaging for stakeholders. Additionally, reflecting current social challenges faced by the community could bridge gaps between stakeholder expectations and educational goals.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses very formal language that may not be typical in a casual or semi-formal meeting setting. Phrases like ""nuanced approach"" and ""critically evaluate the linguistic complexity"" feel overly academic.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language to enhance realism. For example: ""We need to find a balanced way to include their feedback without losing sight of our goals."" instead of ""integrating stakeholder feedback requires a nuanced approach.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of natural conversational flow.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks interruptions, affirmations, or casual interjections that are common in real meetings (e.g., ""That's a good point,"" ""I agree,"" etc.).
   **Suggested Improvement:** Add some natural conversational elements such as affirmations or brief interjections to create a more realistic flow. For example: 
   - Linguist: ""Um, integrating stakeholder feedback requires a nuanced approach.""
   - Language Educator: ""That's true.""
   
4. **Issue Description:** Excessive agreement without debate.
   **Reasoning:** Everyone agrees with each other without any differing opinions or debates, which is uncommon in real meetings where diverse perspectives often lead to discussions or disagreements.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce some differing viewpoints or questions that challenge ideas presented by others. For example:
   - Sociolinguist: ""Hmm... addressing disagreements is crucial.""
   - Language Educator: ""But how do we handle situations where stakeholders have conflicting interests?""

5. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic use of technical jargon.
   **Reasoning:** While technical terms are expected in professional settings, the consistent use of jargon without simpler explanations can feel forced and less authentic.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Balance technical jargon with simpler explanations for clarity and realism. For example:
   - Linguist: ""Incorporating idiomatic expressions from various dialects can enhance inclusivity while maintaining educational rigor.""
     Revised: ""Using phrases from different dialects can make our content more inclusive and still challenging enough for educational purposes.""

6. **Issue Description:** Lack of personal engagement or anecdotes.
    **Reasoning:** Real meetings often include personal anecdotes or references to past experiences that relate to the topic at hand, adding authenticity to the conversation.
    **Suggested Improvement:** Include brief personal anecdotes or references to previous projects for added realism. For example:
    - Anthropologist: “In one of my previous projects, including local traditions really helped engage the community.”",">>Language Educator: Fantastic!

This finding underscores the importance of preserving such languages as they offer invaluable insights into human cognition and linguistic diversity.
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! The whistled language practice is a perfect example of how cultural context shapes communication. It's not just about the sounds, but the entire cultural framework that supports this unique form of interaction.
>>Sociolinguist: Interestingly, in one community I studied, the use of language varies not just by social status but also by age. Older members often use more traditional dialects, while younger people incorporate modern slang and borrowings from other languages. It's fascinating how these variations can highlight generational differences and influence social cohesion!

>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! The whistled language practice is a perfect example of how cultural context shapes communication. It's not just about the sounds, but the entire cultural framework that supports this unique form of interaction.",">>Linguist: You know, one of my most memorable discoveries was identifying a unique syntactic structure in an endangered language. This structure allows for recursive embedding of clauses, which provides fascinating insights into the cognitive capabilities of its speakers and challenges our understanding of linguistic universals.
>>Anthropologist: Um, you know, one of the most fascinating cultural practices I've encountered is the use of whistled language in certain communities. In these places, people can communicate complex messages over long distances using whistles! It's amazing how culture shapes language use.
>>Sociolinguist: I mean, one of the most engaging stories I've come across involves a community where language variation is deeply tied to social dynamics. In this village, people use different dialects depending on their social status and roles within the community. It's fascinating how language can reflect and reinforce social hierarchies!
>>Language Educator: Let's consider a moment from my classroom. I had a student who struggled with reading comprehension, but when we started using stories from his own culture, he became more engaged and his understanding improved dramatically. Incorporating culturally relevant materials can make a huge difference in language acquisition.
>>Linguist: To put it in perspective—
>>Anthropologist [interrupting]: Sorry to jump in here—could you clarify what you mean by ""recursive embedding""? I'm not sure everyone is familiar with that term.
>>Linguist: Of course! Recursive embedding refers to the ability to nest clauses within other clauses indefinitely. For example, ""The cat that chased the mouse that stole the cheese ran away."" This kind of structure shows complex cognitive processing and is quite rare among languages.
>>Anthropologist: Ah, got it! Thanks for explaining.
>>Linguist: No problem! So as I was saying, this discovery not only highlights the cognitive complexity of its speakers but also challenges our preconceived notions about linguistic universals. This finding underscores the importance of preserving such languages as they offer invaluable insights into human cognition and linguistic diversity.
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! The whistled language practice is a perfect example of how cultural context shapes communication. It's not just about the sounds but the entire cultural framework that supports this unique form of interaction.","1. **Issue Description:** Overly formal and repetitive language.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue contains several instances of overly formal language and repetition, which can make the conversation feel unnatural. For example, phrases like ""provides fascinating insights into the cognitive capabilities of its speakers"" and ""challenges our understanding of linguistic universals"" are quite formal for a casual meeting discussion. Additionally, each speaker starts with a similar structure (""one of my most memorable discoveries,"" ""one of the most fascinating cultural practices,"" etc.), which feels repetitive.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language and vary the sentence structures to make the dialogue feel more natural. For instance:
   - Linguist: ""I once discovered a unique syntactic structure in an endangered language that allows clauses to be nested within each other. It's really interesting because it shows how complex their cognitive processes are.""
   - Anthropologist: ""I've seen some amazing cultural practices, like communities using whistled languages to communicate over long distances. It's incredible how culture influences language.""

2. **Issue Description:** Lack of natural interruptions or back-and-forth interaction.
   **Reasoning:** In real meetings, participants often interrupt each other or engage in more dynamic exchanges rather than waiting for one person to finish completely before responding. The current dialogue lacks this natural flow.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce more interruptions and interactive elements to mimic real-life conversations better:
   - Linguist: ""To put it in perspective—""
   - Anthropologist [interrupting]: ""Sorry to jump in here—could you clarify what you mean by 'recursive embedding'? I'm not sure everyone is familiar with that term.""
   - Linguist: ""Sure! It means nesting clauses within other clauses indefinitely, like 'The cat that chased the mouse that stole the cheese ran away.' This shows complex cognitive processing.""

3. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic politeness and lack of disagreement.
   **Reasoning:** Real meetings often include disagreements or differing opinions, which add authenticity to the conversation. The current scene is overly polite and agreeable without any contrasting viewpoints.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce some mild disagreements or different perspectives:
   - Sociolinguist: ""I find it fascinating how dialects reflect social hierarchies.""
   - Language Educator: ""That's true, but I've also seen cases where dialects bring communities together rather than divide them.""

4. **Issue Description:** Excessive explanation without prompting.
   **Reasoning:** The linguist's detailed explanation about recursive embedding seems too lengthy for a casual interruption request from the anthropologist.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Provide a shorter explanation initially and allow for follow-up questions if needed:
   - Linguist: ""Recursive embedding means nesting clauses within other clauses indefinitely.""
   - Anthropologist: ""Can you give an example?""",">>Linguist: I once discovered a unique syntactic structure in an endangered language that allows clauses to be nested within each other. It's really interesting because it shows how complex their cognitive processes are.

>>Language Educator: Fantastic! We've covered a lot today. To put it simply, we need to ensure our educational goals align with stakeholder feedback. Let's set up teacher training workshops to integrate these narratives effectively.
>>Linguist: Indeed! To summarize, we've agreed on the importance of integrating cultural narratives and interactive methods into our language education strategy. From a linguistic standpoint, it's crucial to ensure these stories are linguistically challenging yet accessible. Our next steps should include organizing teacher training workshops to equip educators with the necessary tools and techniques. Let's also set a date for our follow-up meeting to review progress and address any emerging challenges.",">>Language Educator: Um, fantastic! We've covered a lot today.

Our next steps should include organizing teacher training workshops to equip educators with the necessary tools and techniques. Let's also set a date for our follow-up meeting to review progress and address any emerging challenges.

>>Anthropologist: Right! You know, it's essential that we consider the cultural context when developing these educational materials. Like I mentioned earlier about whistled languages, incorporating unique cultural practices can really enhance student engagement. How about we aim for next month for our follow-up?

>>Sociolinguist: Sounds good! And let's make sure everyone has a chance to share their thoughts in the next meeting too. We should also think about how social dynamics play into this—like dialects reflecting social hierarchies—and how that impacts learning environments. Um, does everyone agree on setting the follow-up for next month?

>>Language Educator: Absolutely! Next month works for me. We'll need to prepare some preliminary materials before then so we can hit the ground running.

>>Linguist: Agreed! I'll start drafting some guidelines based on today's discussion and circulate them ahead of time.

>>Anthropologist: Perfect! I'll gather more examples of cultural practices influencing language use that we can incorporate into our materials.

>>Sociolinguist: Great! I'll look into how different communities adapt their dialects in educational settings and share my findings.","1. **Issue Description:** Overly formal and repetitive summaries.
   **Reasoning:** The Linguist's summary is very detailed and repeats points already made by the Language Educator, which feels redundant in a typical meeting setting where participants usually aim for brevity and avoid repeating information.
   **Suggested Improvement:** The Linguist could acknowledge the Language Educator's points briefly and add any new insights or actions without reiterating everything.

2. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of ""um"" and filler words.
   **Reasoning:** While some use of filler words like ""um"" can make dialogue feel natural, their frequent occurrence here makes the conversation seem less professional than expected in a meeting context.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Reduce the number of filler words to maintain a balance between natural speech and professionalism.

3. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic level of agreement without any discussion or differing opinions.
   **Reasoning:** In real meetings, especially those involving multiple experts, there are often differing viewpoints or at least some discussion before reaching consensus. The scene lacks this dynamic entirely.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce brief moments of discussion or differing opinions to reflect realistic interactions among professionals.

4. **Issue Description:** Lack of specific action items or deadlines beyond general agreements.
   **Reasoning:** Meetings typically involve setting specific tasks with clear deadlines rather than just agreeing on broad actions like ""organizing workshops.""
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include more concrete action items with assigned responsibilities and deadlines to enhance realism.

5. **Issue Description:** Unnatural transitions between speakers.
   **Reasoning:** The transitions between speakers are very smooth and lack the natural interruptions or overlaps that occur in real conversations, making it feel staged.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Add minor interruptions or overlapping dialogue to mimic natural conversational flow.

6. **Issue Description:** Repetitive mention of follow-up meeting date without final confirmation.
   **Reasoning:** Multiple mentions about setting the follow-up meeting for next month without a final confirmation feels repetitive and unnecessary in a typical meeting context where such decisions are usually confirmed once clearly.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Confirm the follow-up meeting date once after initial suggestions instead of repeatedly mentioning it.

7. **Issue Description:** Lack of informal language or casual remarks that typically occur in meetings among colleagues.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic meetings often include casual remarks or informal language that help build rapport among participants; this scene is overly formal throughout.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Incorporate occasional informal comments or light-hearted remarks to make the interaction feel more authentic.",">>Language Educator: Fantastic!
