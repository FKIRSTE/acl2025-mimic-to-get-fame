The summary indicates that participants should greet each other, set the stage for the meeting, and briefly mention ocean acidification as the main topic. However, the transcript jumps directly into detailed discussions about ocean acidification without any greetings or setting the stage for the meeting. While the content on ocean acidification is relevant and informative, it lacks the introductory elements specified in the summary. To improve this scene, participants should start with quick hellos and acknowledgments, provide an overview of meeting objectives, and then transition into discussing ocean acidification."
