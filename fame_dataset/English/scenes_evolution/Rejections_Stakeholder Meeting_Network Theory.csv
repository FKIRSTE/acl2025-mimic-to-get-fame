>>Mathematician: Consider this: in scale-free networks, the immunization strategy that targets high-degree nodes is theoretically optimal because these nodes act as super-spreaders. However, identifying these nodes can be challenging without complete network data. To put it simply, we need efficient algorithms to approximate the most influential nodes based on partial information.
