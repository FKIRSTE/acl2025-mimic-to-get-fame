The summary specifies that Scene 1 should include a brief welcome, setting the tone for the forum, an overview of meeting objectives, and encouragement for spontaneous contributions. However, the transcript jumps directly into detailed discussions about the Great Depression from various perspectives without any greeting or overview of meeting objectives. While the content is rich and informative, it lacks the essential elements required to set up the scene properly. To improve this scene, participants should start with a brief greeting among themselves, provide an overview of what they aim to discuss during the forum, and encourage each other to contribute spontaneously throughout their discussion."
