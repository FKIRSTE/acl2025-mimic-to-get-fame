   **Suggested Improvement:** Each participant should contribute unique insights or questions to advance the discussion. For example, one could focus on specific case studies, another on regulatory challenges, and another on public perception.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The language used by all participants is highly formal and lacks the conversational tone typical in real meetings. Phrases like ""profound moral questions"" and ""stringent ethical standards"" are more suited to written reports than spoken dialogue.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more natural language that reflects how professionals would speak in a meeting. For instance, ""This raises some serious ethical issues we need to think about,"" instead of ""Ethically speaking, the heritable nature of germline modifications indeed raises profound moral questions.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between participants.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue consists mostly of monologues with little direct interaction or acknowledgment of each other's points. Realistic meetings often involve back-and-forth exchanges where participants build on or challenge each other's ideas.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include more interactive elements such as agreeing, disagreeing, asking follow-up questions, or referencing previous points made by others.

4. **Issue Description:** Excessive focus on theoretical aspects without practical examples.
   **Reasoning:** The conversation remains abstract without concrete examples or references to specific studies, trials, or real-world applications that would typically be discussed in such a meeting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Incorporate references to actual clinical trials, specific genetic disorders being targeted, or recent advancements in gene therapy to ground the discussion in reality.

5. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic portrayal of expertise overlap.
   **Reasoning:** All participants seem to have an equally deep understanding of both genetic engineering techniques and bioethical considerations, which is unlikely given their distinct professional backgrounds (geneticist vs bioethicist vs virologist).
   **Suggested Improvement:** Ensure each participant speaks from their area of expertise while acknowledging gaps in their knowledge that others might fill. For example: ""As a geneticist, I can speak to the technical aspects but I'd love to hear more about the ethical perspective from our bioethicist.""

6. **Issue Description:** Lack of personal opinions or experiences.
   **Reasoning:** Participants do not share personal opinions or experiences which are common in real meetings where individuals express their viewpoints based on their professional background and experiences.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Encourage participants to share personal insights or anecdotes related to their work: ""In my experience working with somatic cell modifications...""
