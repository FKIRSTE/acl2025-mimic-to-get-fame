While the core topic of integrating art therapy into palliative care is discussed, the excessive repetition makes the conversation feel unnatural and poorly structured. The scene fails to adequately include spontaneous contributions or brief off-topic discussions to lighten the mood, which are essential elements according to the summary. To improve, participants should focus on sharing unique insights or experiences related to art therapy and palliative care, while also incorporating natural deviations that add depth and authenticity to their interaction."
