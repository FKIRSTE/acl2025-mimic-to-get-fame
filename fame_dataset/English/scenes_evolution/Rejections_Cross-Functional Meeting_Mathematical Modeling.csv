>>Applied Mathematician: Let's consider the following example: when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part into our model and acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost and increased uncertainty due to complexity would inhibit its usage. Therefore, approximations are often made to reduce the model to a sensible size.
>>Natural Scientist: From a scientific perspective, the trade-off between model complexity and computational feasibility is crucial. Indeed, while detailed models can provide more accurate predictions, they often become impractical due to high computational costs and increased uncertainty. Simplifying the model by making approximations allows us to maintain robustness and usability.
>>Data Scientist: Wow! That's a fascinating point about the trade-off between model complexity and computational feasibility. From a machine learning perspective, we often face similar challenges when building predictive models. You know, sometimes simplifying the model can actually improve its performance by reducing overfitting and making it more generalizable to new data.
