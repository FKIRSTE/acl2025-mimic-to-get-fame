However, the dialogue is highly repetitive, with each character repeating similar points multiple times without significant variation or progression in the conversation. This makes the scene feel unnatural and poorly structured. To improve, participants should focus on diversifying their contributions, building on each other's points, and ensuring a more dynamic and engaging discussion."
