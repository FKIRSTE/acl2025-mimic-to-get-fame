>>Global Health Advocate: From a global health perspective, it's imperative that we address the systemic barriers to equitable access to surgical care. Let's ensure our initiatives are supported by robust policy frameworks and adequate funding to truly make an impact!","The transcript repeatedly covers the core requirements from the summary, including a recap of aligned project objectives (advanced surgical techniques and multi-modal pain management), review of resolved issues (integration of tailored training modules and policy frameworks), and planning follow-up actions for enhanced collaboration. However, the dialogue is highly repetitive and lacks natural flow or depth. The scene could be improved by reducing redundancy, adding more varied interactions between participants, and ensuring each character contributes uniquely to the discussion."
