How do we integrate these insights into practical applications that enhance learning and memory across different life stages?","1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive statements by the Child Psychologist.
   **Reasoning:** The Child Psychologist's comments are almost identical in two instances, which feels unnatural and redundant in a real meeting setting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Combine the insights into one comprehensive statement to avoid repetition. For example: ""As we delve into developmental psychology, let's consider how this affects children at different stages of growth. These behavioral insights can really help us support kids in their unique journeys.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language used by multiple participants.
   **Reasoning:** While meetings can be formal, the language here is excessively structured and lacks conversational flow typical of human interactions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more natural phrasing and conversational tones. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to explore developmental psychology and see how it impacts human growth throughout life.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""Morning! I'm excited about today's discussion on developmental psychology. Understanding how people grow can really help us improve our teaching methods.""
   - Neuroscientist: ""Good morning! Let's dive into how the brain's mechanisms influence cognitive and behavioral changes over time.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction or acknowledgment between participants.
   **Reasoning:** Realistic meetings often include participants acknowledging each other's points or building upon them, which fosters a collaborative atmosphere.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include brief acknowledgments or follow-up questions to create a more interactive dialogue. For example:
   - Educational Psychologist: ""Morning! I agree with what you said about understanding growth—it’s crucial for tailoring our teaching methods.""
   - Social Worker: ""That's a great point about individual development. Could we also touch on family dynamics as they relate to this?""

4. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of titles before speaking (e.g., Developmental Psychologist).
   **Reasoning:** In real meetings, participants typically address each other by name rather than titles unless it's a very formal setting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use names instead of titles for a more natural conversation flow.

5. **Issue Description:** The Cognitive Scientist's statement feels disconnected from previous comments.
   **Reasoning:** The Cognitive Scientist's input does not build on or reference earlier points made by others, making it feel isolated within the conversation.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Integrate the comment with previous discussions for coherence. For example: ""Building on what was mentioned about brain development, from a cognitive standpoint, understanding mental processes involved in developmental psychology is essential...""

6. **Issue Description:** Social Worker’s question could be integrated better into the flow of conversation.
    **Reasoning**: The question interrupts the flow without much context or transition from previous statements.
    **Suggested Improvement**: Provide smoother transitions leading up to questions for clarity and continuity.",">>Dr. Smith (Developmental Psychologist): Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to explore developmental psychology and see how it impacts human growth throughout life.

   - Developmental Psychologist: ""These attachments also impact how individuals navigate relationships throughout their lives.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""In educational settings, secure attachments foster curiosity and participation.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses very formal language that feels stiff and unnatural for a typical meeting setting where professionals might speak more casually.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language to make the dialogue feel authentic. For example:
   - Neuroscientist: ""Actually, early attachments really shape brain development—especially areas related to emotions and social skills.""
   - Cognitive Scientist: ""Secure attachments help with problem-solving because they make kids feel safe; insecure ones can mess with these processes.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between speakers.
   **Reasoning:** The speakers do not seem to be responding directly to each other’s points or engaging in a back-and-forth discussion, which is common in real meetings.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Encourage more direct responses and interactions between speakers. For example:
   - Social Worker: ""I agree with what the Child Psychologist said about secure attachments fostering confidence. In my experience working with families...""
   
4. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of filler words like ""um"" and ""you know.""
   **Reasoning:** While some filler words are natural in speech, their excessive use here makes the dialogue feel forced rather than spontaneous.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Reduce the number of filler words to improve flow while maintaining some for authenticity. For example:
   - Educational Psychologist: ""From an educational standpoint, attachment styles can influence how children engage in learning environments.""

5. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic repetition of job titles before speaking.
   **Reasoning:** In real meetings, participants typically do not repeatedly state their job titles before making every point.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce each participant once at the beginning and then refer to them by name or pronoun thereafter.

6. **Issue Description:** Forced inclusion of multiple perspectives without natural transitions.
    **Reasoning**: The scene tries too hard to include various professional viewpoints without smooth transitions between topics, making it feel disjointed.
    **Suggested Improvement**: Create smoother transitions by having speakers naturally build on each other's points or ask questions that lead into different perspectives.

   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue repeatedly mentions Bronfenbrenner's theory without adding new insights or perspectives, which can feel redundant and overly formal for a typical meeting. In real meetings, participants often build on each other's points or introduce new ideas rather than reiterating the same concept multiple times.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Encourage participants to expand on the theory by discussing specific case studies, practical applications, or contrasting it with other theories to provide depth and variety in the conversation.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language and structure.
   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses very formal language and structured sentences that lack the casual tone often found in real meetings. Phrases like ""Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory offers a comprehensive framework"" are more suited to academic writing than spoken dialogue.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language and allow for informal exchanges between participants. For example, instead of saying ""offers a comprehensive framework,"" one might say ""I think this theory really helps us understand...""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between speakers.
   - **Reasoning:** Each speaker presents their point without engaging directly with others' comments, which is uncommon in realistic meetings where participants typically respond to each other's ideas, ask questions, or seek clarification.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Include interactions such as agreeing with previous points, asking follow-up questions, or challenging ideas to create a more dynamic and engaging conversation.

4. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic repetition of similar points by different roles (e.g., Child Psychologist and Developmental Psychologist both discussing exosystem impacts).
   - **Reasoning:** In real meetings, professionals from different fields usually bring unique perspectives based on their expertise rather than repeating similar observations made by others.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Assign distinct viewpoints or examples related to each professional's field to ensure diverse contributions that enrich the discussion.

5. **Issue Description:** Lack of specific examples or anecdotes.
   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks concrete examples or anecdotes that would make the theoretical concepts more relatable and grounded in reality. Real meetings often include specific cases or experiences shared by participants.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Integrate specific examples from practice or research findings that illustrate how these systems impact development in various contexts.

6. **Issue Description:** Unnatural enthusiasm expressed by Neuroscientist (""Fascinating!"").
   - **Reasoning:** While enthusiasm is common in discussions, the abrupt expression ""Fascinating!"" followed by repetitive information feels forced and less authentic compared to natural expressions of interest during conversations.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Allow for more natural expressions of interest through interactive engagement like asking questions about others' points or sharing related insights from recent studies.

7. **Issue Description**: Redundant statements about mesosystem interactions across socioeconomic backgrounds (Social Worker vs Educational Psychologist).
    - **Reasoning**: Both roles discuss similar impacts without adding new dimensions; this redundancy can make dialogues feel stagnant rather than progressive as expected in collaborative settings.
    -  Suggested Improvement: Encourage exploration into how these interactions manifest differently across cultures or regions instead of repeating socioeconomic factors alone.

The chronosystem highlights how life events and transitions impact growth over time. I've seen this firsthand with children adapting to new schools after moving to different countries.

>>Neuroscientist: From my perspective, the chronosystem's impact on cognitive development is particularly fascinating. Research shows that major life changes can significantly alter neural pathways. For example, kids who move frequently might develop stronger adaptability skills but also face challenges in forming stable relationships.

>>Developmental Psychologist: And let's not forget the macrosystem—cultural values and societal norms play a huge role too. In some cultures, communal living shapes children's social behaviors differently than in more individualistic societies.

>>Educational Psychologist: Right! The mesosystem includes interactions between different microsystems like home and school. If teachers and parents are on the same page, it can really boost a child's learning experience. How do you think these interactions vary across different socioeconomic backgrounds?

>>Social Worker: When families and schools collaborate effectively, it creates stability that nurtures children's growth regardless of their background. I've seen community programs make a huge difference in low-income areas by providing consistent support networks.

>>Cognitive Scientist: Exactly! The interplay between these systems is dynamic; mental processes are continuously shaped by environmental stimuli. For instance, kids facing frequent relocations might develop unique problem-solving abilities due to constant adaptation.

>>Developmental Psychologist: Speaking of external influences—the exosystem includes factors like parental work schedules that indirectly affect children’s development. If parents are often away due to demanding jobs, it can impact emotional security and academic performance differently across cultures.

>>Social Worker: Strengthening mesosystem interactions through community programs is crucial here too. When schools and families work together closely, it creates robust support networks that help children thrive despite diverse backgrounds.

>>Child Psychologist: From what I've observed in practice, the exosystem's influence can be profound indeed. A child whose parent works long hours might struggle with emotional security but could also develop independence early on.

>>Educational Psychologist: Bridging gaps within the mesosystem is essential—think of mentorship programs where teachers partner with parents to support students from various backgrounds more effectively.

>>Neuroscientist: That's true! Recent studies show that significant life transitions can lead to changes in neural pathways affecting adaptation over time—like how children adjust after moving homes or changing schools frequently."

>>Child Psychologist (responding): Great question! It's fascinating because as we observe behavioral changes through longitudinal studies, we often find corresponding shifts in neural connectivity that explain those behaviors.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetition of the importance of longitudinal studies.
   **Reasoning:** Multiple characters reiterate the value of longitudinal studies in very similar ways, which feels redundant and unnatural for a typical meeting where participants usually build on each other's points rather than repeating them.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Each character should contribute unique insights or perspectives related to their field without repeating the same basic idea. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Longitudinal studies are crucial for tracking growth patterns over time.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""They help us tailor educational strategies by capturing learning shifts.""
   - Child Psychologist: ""These studies reveal consistent behavioral patterns that inform interventions.""
   - Neuroscientist: ""We can observe neural pathway evolution and its impact on behavior.""
   - Cognitive Scientist: ""They offer insights into cognitive shifts during developmental transitions.""
   - Social Worker: ""They provide practical support for families by identifying behavioral trends.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses formal language that feels stiff and less conversational, which is not typical in a casual meeting setting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more natural, conversational language to make the dialogue feel authentic. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""I think tracking changes over time with longitudinal studies is really important.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""It's like watching a time-lapse video of how learning evolves—super useful for planning education strategies.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction and engagement between participants.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks natural back-and-forth interactions, questions, and responses that would typically occur in a meeting.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include more interactive elements such as questions, agreements, disagreements, or building on each other's points. For example:
   - Neuroscientist (interrupting): ""Sorry to jump in here—how do you think these behavioral changes correlate with neural developments?""
     Child Psychologist (responding): ""Great question! It's fascinating because as we observe behavioral changes through longitudinal studies, we often find corresponding shifts in neural connectivity that explain those behaviors.""

4. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic interruption and response sequence.
    **Reasoning:** The interruption by the Neuroscientist followed by an immediate detailed response from the Child Psychologist feels staged rather than spontaneous.
    **Suggested Improvement:** Make interruptions and responses more natural with pauses or acknowledgments before continuing. For example:
    - Neuroscientist (interrupting): ""Sorry to jump in here—how do you think these behavioral changes correlate with neural developments?""
      Child Psychologist (pausing briefly): ""That's an interesting point! Actually...""

5. **Issue Description:** Overuse of metaphors and analogies.
    **Reasoning:** The repeated use of metaphors like “time-lapse video” makes the conversation feel forced rather than fluid.
    **Suggested Improvement:** Limit metaphor usage to one or two instances where it adds clarity without overwhelming the discussion.

By addressing these issues, the dialogue will become more realistic and engaging for readers familiar with English-speaking meeting dynamics.",">>Developmental Psychologist: I think tracking changes over time with longitudinal studies is really important.

Let's consider this from another angle: how these stories might influence identity formation across different stages of life, particularly in adolescence where individuals are exploring their sense of self.",">>Child Psychologist: You know, integrating cultural stories into the curriculum can really enhance children's social development. I remember working with a group of kids who were exposed to diverse narratives, and it was fascinating to see their empathy and understanding grow.

>>Educational Psychologist: That's a great point! What if we integrate these stories into project-based learning? Students could create projects exploring different cultures, fostering both creativity and understanding.

>>Developmental Psychologist: Absolutely. Integrating cultural narratives offers profound insights into moral and social growth. Let's consider how these stories might influence identity formation, especially during adolescence when individuals are exploring their sense of self.

>>Neuroscientist: From a neurological perspective, um, integrating cultural narratives can influence neural pathways related to empathy and social cognition. Research shows exposure to diverse stories enhances brain plasticity, allowing for more adaptive responses in social interactions.

>>Social Worker: I've seen how integrating cultural narratives fosters belonging within communities. Families sharing heritage stories in workshops often find new ways to connect. It's amazing to see the bonds that form.

>>Cognitive Scientist: Well, you see, using cultural stories in curricula can enhance problem-solving skills by providing diverse perspectives. It encourages students to think critically about their own beliefs while empathizing with others.

>>Child Psychologist: You know, storytelling is such a powerful tool for children. I recall a session where kids shared heritage stories; it was incredible seeing their confidence blossom as they built empathy and understanding.

>>Developmental Psychologist: In developmental terms, cultural narratives shape identity formation by providing adolescents with frameworks to explore their sense of self. Exposure to varied stories significantly enhances their ability to navigate social roles and moral reasoning.

>>Educational Psychologist: Consider this—integrating cultural narratives into collaborative projects can be transformative. Students could work together on presentations or performances that deepen understanding and foster creativity.

>>Social Worker: Um, from my experience in community workshops, families sharing heritage stories often strengthen bonds and support each other better. It's wonderful seeing the sense of belonging develop through storytelling sessions.

>>Neuroscientist: Actually, it's fascinating how exposure to diverse narratives impacts brain plasticity related to empathy—allowing for more adaptive responses in social interactions over time.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetition of ideas and phrases.
   **Reasoning:** Several participants repeat similar points about the benefits of integrating cultural narratives, particularly regarding empathy, social cognition, identity formation, and community bonding. This redundancy can make the dialogue feel unnatural and overly scripted.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Consolidate similar points to avoid repetition. For example:
   - Child Psychologist: ""Integrating cultural stories into the curriculum can enhance children's social development by fostering empathy and understanding.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""That's a great point! Integrating these stories into project-based learning could foster creativity and understanding.""
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Absolutely. These narratives offer insights into moral growth and identity formation during adolescence.""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The language used by some participants is excessively formal for a typical meeting setting, making it sound less conversational and more like an academic presentation.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more natural, conversational language. For example:
   - Neuroscientist: ""From a neurological perspective, integrating cultural stories can really help with empathy and social skills. Research shows that exposure to diverse stories makes our brains more adaptable in social situations.""
   - Cognitive Scientist: ""Using cultural stories in lessons can improve problem-solving skills by giving students different perspectives to think about.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between participants.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks natural back-and-forth interactions or follow-up questions that are common in meetings where participants build on each other's ideas.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include more interactive elements such as questions or comments that show engagement with each other's points. For example:
   - Educational Psychologist: ""That's a great point! What if we integrate these stories into project-based learning? Students could create projects exploring different cultures.""
     - Child Psychologist: ""I love that idea! It would be amazing to see how their creativity flourishes through these projects.""

4. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic frequency of personal anecdotes.
   **Reasoning:** Multiple participants share personal anecdotes in quick succession, which feels forced rather than naturally occurring within the flow of conversation.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Limit the number of personal anecdotes or space them out more naturally within the discussion. For example:
   - Child Psychologist: ""I remember working with kids who were exposed to diverse narratives; their empathy grew significantly.""
     (Later in the conversation)
     - Social Worker: ""I've seen families bond over heritage stories in workshops; it's wonderful seeing those connections form.""

5. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of filler words (""um"").
   **Reasoning:** The use of filler words like ""um"" is inconsistent—some speakers use them while others do not, which can disrupt the flow and realism of the dialogue.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Ensure consistent use or removal of filler words to maintain a natural conversational tone.

By addressing these issues, the meeting scene will feel more realistic and engaging for readers familiar with English-speaking meeting dynamics.",">>Child Psychologist: Integrating cultural stories into the curriculum can really enhance children's social development by fostering empathy and understanding.

>>Educational Psychologist: I mean... exploring pilot programs sounds like a solid idea! It would let us see how project-based learning with cultural narratives fosters creativity while ensuring the content remains age-appropriate.","1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive emphasis on age-appropriateness and cognitive overload.
   - **Reasoning:** Each speaker reiterates the importance of tailoring narratives to developmental stages to avoid cognitive overload, which becomes redundant. In a typical meeting, once a point is made, subsequent speakers might acknowledge it but would likely focus on adding new insights or perspectives rather than repeating the same concern.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** After the first few mentions of age-appropriateness and cognitive overload, later speakers could build upon this by discussing specific strategies for implementation or sharing examples from their experiences.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language in casual dialogue.
   - **Reasoning:** Phrases like ""significantly boost social-emotional development"" and ""strengthening neural pathways related to emotional regulation"" are quite formal for a conversational setting. While professionals may use technical terms, they often balance them with more accessible language in meetings to ensure clarity and engagement.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Use simpler language or analogies that convey the same meaning without sounding overly academic. For example, ""help kids understand each other better"" instead of ""boost social-emotional development.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between participants.
   - **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks natural back-and-forth exchanges typical in meetings where participants respond directly to each other's points, ask questions, or express agreement/disagreement. This makes the conversation feel more like a series of monologues rather than an interactive discussion.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Include elements such as direct responses (""I agree with what you said about...""), questions (""Could you elaborate on how...""), or expressions of interest (""That's an interesting point!"") to create a more dynamic interaction.

4. **Issue Description:** Unnatural transition between topics.
   - **Reasoning:** The transition from discussing cultural narratives' impact on empathy and problem-solving skills to suggesting pilot programs feels abrupt without any bridging comments that naturally lead from one topic to another.
   - **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce transitional phrases that connect ideas smoothly, such as ""Building on our discussion about empathy..."" or ""Considering these benefits, exploring pilot programs could be our next step.""",">>Educational Psychologist: You know, integrating cultural narratives into educational projects can really boost creativity and problem-solving skills.

   **Reasoning:** Each speaker repeats the phrase ""implementing pilot programs,"" which feels redundant and unnatural in a typical meeting setting. In real conversations, participants usually build on each other's points without repeating the exact same phrase multiple times.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Vary the language used to discuss the implementation of pilot programs. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Um, I think we should finalize our decision to start these pilot initiatives...""
   - Child Psychologist: ""You know, launching these pilots will allow us to observe firsthand...""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""I mean, breaking this down, starting these programs seems like a practical step forward...""

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue uses very formal language that doesn't reflect natural conversational patterns in meetings. Phrases like ""ensure they're tailored appropriately"" and ""monitor their impact effectively"" are more suited for written reports than spoken dialogue.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more casual and conversational language. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""...and make sure they're suitable for different age groups.""
   - Social Worker: ""...and keep an eye on how well they're working.""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction or acknowledgment between speakers.
   **Reasoning:** In realistic meetings, participants often acknowledge each other's points or ask questions to clarify or expand on ideas. This dialogue lacks such interactions, making it feel less dynamic and collaborative.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include acknowledgments or questions to create a more interactive conversation. For example:
   - Child Psychologist: ""That's a great point about social skills, and I think we can also look at empathy development through these stories.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""I agree with both of you; let's break this down further...""

4. **Issue Description:** Excessive focus on assigning tasks without discussing specifics.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue repeatedly mentions assigning tasks but doesn't delve into specific actions or responsibilities, which can make it feel vague and repetitive.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Provide specific examples of tasks or responsibilities to add depth to the conversation. For example:
   - Social Worker: ""...we should assign team members to develop content for different age groups and cultural contexts.""

5. **Issue Description:** Lack of emotional engagement or personal opinions.
    **Reasoning:** The speakers do not express any personal opinions or emotions about the topic, which makes the conversation feel flat and impersonal.
    **Suggested Improvement:** Include expressions of enthusiasm or concern to add authenticity. For example:
    - Developmental Psychologist: ""I'm really excited about seeing how these narratives can help kids understand their world better.""",">>Developmental Psychologist: Um, I think we should finalize our decision to start these pilot initiatives.

Does that sound good?

>>All Participants: Yes/Absolutely/Sounds good!

>>Child Psychologist: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and contributions today. Let's reconvene next week to review our progress and address any challenges that come up.","1. **Issue Description:** Overly formal and repetitive assignment of tasks.
   **Reasoning:** The Child Psychologist's recap of the assigned tasks feels redundant and overly formal, as each participant has already clearly stated their responsibilities. In a typical meeting, such detailed repetition is unnecessary and can be streamlined for efficiency.
   **Suggested Improvement:** The Child Psychologist could simply confirm that everyone is clear on their roles without repeating each task verbatim. For example: ""Great! It sounds like everyone knows their responsibilities. Let's reconvene next week to review our progress.""

2. **Issue Description:** Lack of natural conversational flow.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue lacks interruptions, overlaps, or informal language that typically occur in real meetings. Realistic conversations often include interjections, casual remarks, or slight deviations from the main topic.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce some natural elements such as brief interjections or casual comments to make the conversation feel more authentic. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Absolutely, I agree. We need to outline who will be responsible for each aspect of the pilot initiatives.""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""Right, I'll focus on integrating practical steps... Oh, and we should set some milestones to track our progress.""
   
3. **Issue Description:** Uniform agreement responses.
   **Reasoning:** The unanimous and identical agreement responses (""Yes/Absolutely/Sounds good!"") are unrealistic as participants usually express agreement in varied ways or might have additional comments/questions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Vary the responses to reflect individual communication styles and add potential follow-up questions or comments. For example:
   - Developmental Psychologist: ""Sounds good!""
   - Educational Psychologist: ""Absolutely! Should we set up a shared document for tracking?""
   - Neuroscientist: ""Yes, I'm looking forward to seeing how this develops.""

4. **Issue Description:** Lack of personal engagement or acknowledgment.
   **Reasoning:** Participants do not acknowledge each other's contributions personally which can make the conversation feel robotic and impersonal.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include acknowledgments or expressions of appreciation for specific contributions to foster a more engaging atmosphere. For example:
   - Social Worker: ""You know, it's important that we consider family dynamics as well...""
   - Child Psychologist: ""That's a great point [Social Worker], thank you for bringing that up.""

5. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of titles instead of names.
   **Reasoning:** Using professional titles repeatedly instead of names can feel stiff and unnatural in a collaborative setting where participants are likely familiar with one another.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use names instead of titles after initial introductions to create a more relaxed and collegial tone.
