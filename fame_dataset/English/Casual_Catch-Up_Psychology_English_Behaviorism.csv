Behaviorism,"

Behaviorism is a systematic approach to understand the behavior of humans and other animals.[1][2] It assumes that behavior is either a reflex elicited by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli. Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of heredity in determining behavior, deriving from Skinner's two levels of selection: phylogeny and ontogeny.[3] they focus primarily on environmental events. The cognitive revolution of the late 20th century largely replaced behaviorism as an explanatory theory with cognitive psychology, which unlike behaviorism views internal mental states as explanations for observable behavior.

Behaviorism emerged in the early 1900s as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. It was derived from earlier research in the late nineteenth century, such as when Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect, a procedure that involved the use of consequences to strengthen or weaken behavior.

With a 1924 publication, John B. Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until 1945 that B. F. Skinner proposed that covert behavior—including cognition and emotions—are subject to the same controlling variables as observable behavior,[4] which became the basis for his philosophy called radical behaviorism.[5][6] While Watson and Ivan Pavlov investigated how (conditioned) neutral stimuli elicit reflexes in respondent conditioning, Skinner assessed the reinforcement histories of the discriminative (antecedent) stimuli that emits behavior; the process became known as operant conditioning.

The application of radical behaviorism—known as applied behavior analysis—is used in a variety of contexts, including, for example, applied animal behavior and organizational behavior management to treatment of mental disorders, such as autism and substance abuse.[7][8] In addition, while behaviorism and cognitive schools of psychological thought do not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in the cognitive-behavioral therapies, which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple phobias, PTSD, and mood disorders.

The titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:

Two subtypes of theoretical behaviorism are:

B. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the experimental analysis of behavior. This viewpoint differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways, but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors also subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism, it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions, such as American pragmatism.[15]

Although John B. Watson mainly emphasized his position of methodological behaviorism throughout his career, Watson and Rosalie Rayner conducted the infamous Little Albert experiment (1920), a study in which Ivan Pavlov's theory to respondent conditioning was first applied to eliciting a fearful reflex of crying in a human infant, and this became the launching point for understanding covert behavior (or private events) in radical behaviorism;[16] however, Skinner felt that aversive stimuli should only be experimented on with animals and spoke out against Watson for testing something so controversial on a human.[citation needed]

In 1959, Skinner observed the emotions of two pigeons by noting that they appeared angry because their feathers ruffled. The pigeons were placed together in an operant chamber, where they were aggressive as a consequence of previous reinforcement in the environment. Through stimulus control and subsequent discrimination training, whenever Skinner turned off the green light, the pigeons came to notice that the food reinforcer is discontinued following each peck and responded without aggression. Skinner concluded that humans also learn aggression and possess such emotions (as well as other private events) no differently than do nonhuman animals.[citation needed]

As experimental behavioural psychology is related to behavioral neuroscience, we can date the first researches in the area were done in the beginning of 19th century.[17] Later, this essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books The Behavior of Organisms and Schedules of Reinforcement.[18][19] Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and S–R theory.

Skinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on trial-and-error learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus-response ""association"" or ""connection"" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the ""free operant"", so-called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers, a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work Are Theories of Learning Necessary? in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior.[20][21]

As Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book Verbal Behavior[22] and other language-related publications;[23] Verbal Behavior laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by Noam Chomsky.[24][25]

Skinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas,[26] and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed.[27][28][29][30][31][32] Innateness theory, which has been heavily critiqued,[33][34] is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning.[35][36][37] According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not language acquisition so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book Contingencies of Reinforcement,[23] Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such ""instructional control"" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of relational frame theory.[38][39][40][41]

B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior (1957) does not quite emphasize on language development, but to understand human behavior. Additionally, his work serves in understanding social interactions in the child's early developmental stages focusing on the topic of caregiver-infant interaction.[42] Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior terminology and theories is commonly used to understand the relationship between language development but was primarily designed to describe behaviors of interest and explain the cause of those behaviors.[42] Noam Chomsky, an American linguistic professor, has criticized and questioned Skinner's theories about the possible suggestion of parental tutoring in language development. However, there is a lack of supporting evidence where Skinner makes the statement.[42] Understanding language is a complex topic but can be understood through the use of two theories: innateness and acquisition. Both theories offer a different perspective whether language is inherently ""acquired"" or ""learned"".[43]

Operant conditioning was developed by B.F. Skinner in 1938 and is form of learning in which the frequency of a behavior is controlled by consequences to change behavior.[44][18][45][46] In other words, behavior is controlled by historical consequential contingencies, particularly reinforcement—a stimulus that increases the probability of performing behaviors, and punishment—a stimulus that decreases such probability.[44] The core tools of consequences are either positive (presenting stimuli following a response), or negative (withdrawn stimuli following a response).[47]

The following descriptions explains the concepts of four common types of consequences in operant conditioning:[48]

A classical experiment in operant conditioning, for example, is the Skinner Box, ""puzzle box"" or operant conditioning chamber to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats, cats and other species. From this experiment, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently with food. Skinner also found that he could shape (create new behavior) the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.

Skinner's model was based on the premise that reinforcement is used for the desired actions or responses while punishment was used to stop the responses of the undesired actions that are not. This theory proved that humans or animals will repeat any action that leads to a positive outcome, and avoid any action that leads to a negative outcome. The experiment with the pigeons showed that a positive outcome leads to learned behavior since the pigeon learned to peck the disc in return for the reward of food.

These historical consequential contingencies subsequently lead to (antecedent) stimulus control, but in contrast to respondent conditioning where antecedent stimuli elicit reflexive behavior, operant behavior is only emitted and therefore does not force its occurrence. It includes the following controlling stimuli:[48]

Although operant conditioning plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, respondent conditioning (also called Pavlovian or classical conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that needs not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure. In the beginning, the dog was provided meat (unconditioned stimulus, UCS, naturally elicit a response that is not controlled) to eat, resulting in increased salivation (unconditioned response, UCR, which means that a response is naturally caused by UCS). Afterward, a bell ring was presented together with food to the dog. Although bell ring was a neutral stimulus (NS, meaning that the stimulus did not have any effect), dog would start to salivate when only hearing a bell ring after a number of pairings. Eventually, the neutral stimulus (bell ring) became conditioned. Therefore, salivation was elicited as a conditioned response (the response same as the unconditioned response), pairing up with meat—the conditioned stimulus)[51]  Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed.[52] The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.

Watson's ""Behaviourist Manifesto"" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the ""science of behaviour""; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states); the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.[53]

Behaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with philosophy of mind.[54][55][56] The basic premise of behaviorism is that the study of behavior should be a natural science, such as chemistry or physics.[57][58]  Initially behaviorism rejected any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior, but B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism reintroduced reference to inner states and also advocated for the study of thoughts and feelings as behaviors subject to the same mechanisms as external behavior.[57][58]  Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to Edmund Fantino and colleagues: ""Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach.""[59]

Behaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a logical behaviorist position[10] (e.g., the beetle in a box argument). In logical positivism (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap[10] and Carl Hempel),[10]  the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W. V. O. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism,[10] influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Quine's work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book The Concept of Mind.[10]  Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented ""category mistakes"", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist,[60] though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.[61]

This is Dennett's main point in ""Skinner Skinned"". Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away... If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now have a better understanding of what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like Weizenbaum's ELIZA program, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.)
Skinner's view of behavior is most often characterized as a ""molecular"" view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article ""Selection by Consequences"".[65] Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: biology (the natural selection or phylogeny of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, culture (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from melioration theory, negative power function discounting or additive versions of negative power function discounting.[66] According to Moore,[67] the perseverance in a molecular examination of behavior may be sign of a desire for an in-depth understanding, maybe to identify any underlying mechanism or components that contribute to comples actions. This strategy might involve elements, procedure, or variables that contribute to behaviorism.

Molar behaviorists, such as Howard Rachlin, Richard Herrnstein, and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as ""associative strength"", are better replaced by molar variables such as rate of reinforcement.[68] Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe ""loving someone"" as a pattern of loving behavior over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as ""love"".

Skinner's radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner's dismissal of theory limited its development. Theoretical behaviorism[12] recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses.  Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called ""latent"" responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons.[69]  Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select.  Theoretical behaviorism links between the brain and the behavior that provides a real understanding of the behavior, rather than a mental presumption of how brain-behavior relates.[70]  The theoretical concept of behaviorism are blended with knowledge of mental structure such as memory and expectancies associated with inflexable behaviorist stances that have traditionally forbidden the examination of the mental state.[71] Because of its flexibility, theoretical behaviorism permits the cognitive process to have an impact on behavior.

From its inception, behavior analysis has centered its examination on cultural occurrences (Skinner, 1953,[72] 1961,[73] 1971,[74] 1974[75]). Nevertheless, the methods used to tackle these occurrences have evolved. Initially, culture was perceived as a factor influencing behavior, later becoming a subject of study in itself.[76] This shift prompted research into group practices and the potential for significant behavioral transformations on a larger scale. Following Glenn's (1986) influential work, ""Metacontingencies in Walden Two"",[77]  numerous research endeavors exploring behavior analysis in cultural contexts have centered around the concept of the metacontingency. Glenn (2003) posited that understanding the origins and development of cultures necessitates delving beyond evolutionary and behavioral principles governing species characteristics and individual learned behaviors requires analysis at a major level.[78]

With the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. Behavior informatics and behavior computing deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.

Pavel et al. (2015) found that in the realm of healthcare and health psychology, substantial evidence supports the notion that personalized health interventions yield greater effectiveness compared to standardized approaches. Additionally, researchers found that recent progress in sensor and communication technology, coupled with data analysis and computational modeling, holds significant potential in revolutionizing interventions aimed at changing health behavior. Simultaneous advancements in sensor and communication technology, alongside the field of data science, have now made it possible to comprehensively measure behaviors occurring in real-life settings. These two elements, when combined with advancements in computational modeling, have laid the groundwork for the emerging discipline known as behavioral informatics. Behavioral informatics represents a scientific and engineering domain encompassing behavior tracking, evaluation, computational modeling, deduction, and intervention.[79]

In the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution.[80][81] This shift was due to radical behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the cognitive therapy movement.
In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:

In more recent years, several scholars have expressed reservations about the pragmatic tendencies of behaviorism.

In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. Cognitive neuroscience, however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.

Staddon (1993) found that Skinner's theory presents two significant deficiencies: Firstly, he downplayed the significance of processes responsible for generating novel behaviors, which it is term as ""behavioral variation."" Skinner primarily emphasized reinforcement as the sole determinant for selecting responses, overlooking these critical processes involved in creating new behaviors. Secondly, both Skinner and many other behaviorists of that era endorsed contiguity as a sufficient process for response selection. However, Rescorla and Wagner (1972) later demonstrated, particularly in classical conditioning, that competition is an essential complement to contiguity. They showed that in operant conditioning, both contiguity and competition are imperative for discerning cause-and-effect relationships.[88]

The influential Rescorla-Wagner model  highlights the significance of competition for limited ""associative value,"" essential for assessing predictability. A similar formal argument was presented by Ying Zhang and John Staddon (1991, in press) concerning operant conditioning: the combination of contiguity and competition among action tendencies suffices as an assignment-of-credit mechanism capable of detecting genuine instrumental contingency between a response and its reinforcer.[89] This mechanism delineates the limitations of Skinner's idea of adventitious reinforcement, revealing its efficacy only under stringent conditions – when the reinforcement's strengthening effect is nearly constant across instances and with very short intervals between reinforcers. However, these conditions rarely hold in reality: behavior following reinforcement tends to exhibit high variability, and superstitious behavior diminishes with extremely brief intervals between reinforcements.[88]

Behavior therapy is a term referring to different types of therapies that treat mental health disorders. It identifies and helps change people's unhealthy behaviors or destructive behaviors through learning theory and conditioning. Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning, as well as counterconditioning are the basis for much of clinical behavior therapy, but also includes other techniques, including operant conditioning—or contingency management, and modeling (sometimes called observational learning). A frequently noted behavior therapy is systematic desensitization (graduated exposure therapy), which was first demonstrated by Joseph Wolpe and Arnold Lazarus.[90]

Applied behavior analysis (ABA)—also called behavioral engineering—is a scientific discipline that applies the principles of behavior analysis to change behavior. ABA derived from much earlier research in the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, which was founded by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues at Harvard University. Nearly a decade after the study ""The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer"" (1959) was published in that journal, which demonstrated how effective the token economy was in reinforcing more adaptive behavior for hospitalized patients with schizophrenia and intellectual disability, it led to researchers at the University of Kansas to start the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis in 1968.

Although ABA and behavior modification are similar behavior-change technologies in that the learning environment is modified through respondent and operant conditioning, behavior modification did not initially address the causes of the behavior (particularly, the environmental stimuli that occurred in the past), or investigate solutions that would otherwise prevent the behavior from reoccurring. As the evolution of ABA began to unfold in the mid-1980s, functional behavior assessments (FBAs) were developed to clarify the function of that behavior, so that it is accurately determined which differential reinforcement contingencies will be most effective and less likely for aversive punishments to be administered.[16][91][92] In addition, methodological behaviorism was the theory underpinning behavior modification since private events were not conceptualized during the 1970s and early 1980s, which contrasted from the radical behaviorism of behavior analysis. ABA—the term that replaced behavior modification—has emerged into a thriving field.[16][93]

The independent development of behaviour analysis outside the United States also continues to develop.[94][95][96][97][98][99] In the US, the American Psychological Association (APA) features a subdivision for Behavior Analysis, titled APA Division 25: Behavior Analysis, which has been in existence since 1964, and the interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as indicated in a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI). Such interests include everything from animal behavior and environmental conservation to classroom instruction (such as direct instruction and precision teaching), verbal behavior, developmental disabilities and autism, clinical psychology (i.e., forensic behavior analysis), behavioral medicine (i.e., behavioral gerontology, AIDS prevention, and fitness training), and consumer behavior analysis.

The field of applied animal behavior—a sub-discipline of ABA that involves training animals—is regulated by the Animal Behavior Society, and those who practice this technique are called applied animal behaviorists. Research on applied animal behavior has been frequently conducted in the Applied Animal Behaviour Science journal since its founding in 1974.

ABA has also been particularly well-established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s, but it was not until the late 1980s that individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders were beginning to grow so rapidly and groundbreaking research was being published that parent advocacy groups started demanding for services throughout the 1990s, which encouraged the formation of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, a credentialing program that certifies professionally trained behavior analysts on the national level to deliver such services. Nevertheless, the certification is applicable to all human services related to the rather broad field of behavior analysis (other than the treatment for autism), and the ABAI currently has 14 accredited MA and Ph.D. programs for comprehensive study in that field.

Early behavioral interventions (EBIs) based on ABA are empirically validated for teaching children with autism and have been proven as such for over the past five decades. Since the late 1990s and throughout the twenty-first century, early ABA interventions have also been identified as the treatment of choice by the US Surgeon General, American Academy of Pediatrics, and US National Research Council.

Discrete trial training—also called early intensive behavioral intervention—is the traditional EBI technique implemented for thirty to forty hours per week that instructs a child to sit in a chair, imitate fine and gross motor behaviors, as well as learn eye contact and speech, which are taught through shaping, modeling, and prompting, with such prompting being phased out as the child begins mastering each skill. When the child becomes more verbal from discrete trials, the table-based instructions are later discontinued, and another EBI procedure known as incidental teaching is introduced in the natural environment by having the child ask for desired items kept out of their direct access, as well as allowing the child to choose the play activities that will motivate them to engage with their facilitators before teaching the child how to interact with other children their own age.

A related term for incidental teaching, called pivotal response treatment (PRT), refers to EBI procedures that exclusively entail twenty-five hours per week of naturalistic teaching (without initially using discrete trials). Current research is showing that there is a wide array of learning styles and that is the children with receptive language delays who initially require discrete trials to acquire speech.

Organizational behavior management, which applies contingency management procedures to model and reinforce appropriate work behavior for employees in organizations, has developed a particularly strong following within ABA, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and Journal of Organizational Behavior Management, which was rated the third-highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating.

Modern-day clinical behavior analysis has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research, with the development of relational frame theory (RFT), which is described as an extension of verbal behavior and a ""post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition.""[100][38][39][40] RFT also forms the empirical basis for acceptance and commitment therapy, a therapeutic approach to counseling often used to manage such conditions as anxiety and obesity that consists of acceptance and commitment, value-based living, cognitive defusion, counterconditioning (mindfulness), and contingency management (positive reinforcement).[101][102][103][104][105][106] Another evidence-based counseling technique derived from RFT is the functional analytic psychotherapy known as behavioral activation that relies on the ACL model—awareness, courage, and love—to reinforce more positive moods for those struggling with depression.

Incentive-based contingency management (CM) is the standard of care for adults with substance-use disorders; it has also been shown to be highly effective for other addictions (i.e., obesity and gambling). Although it does not directly address the underlying causes of behavior, incentive-based CM is highly behavior analytic as it targets the function of the client's motivational behavior by relying on a preference assessment, which is an assessment procedure that allows the individual to select the preferred reinforcer (in this case, the monetary value of the voucher, or the use of other incentives, such as prizes). Another evidence-based CM intervention for substance abuse is community reinforcement approach and family training that uses FBAs and counterconditioning techniques—such as behavioral skills training and relapse prevention—to model and reinforce healthier lifestyle choices which promote self-management of abstinence from drugs, alcohol, or cigarette smoking during high-risk exposure when engaging with family members, friends, and co-workers.

While schoolwide positive behavior support consists of conducting assessments and a task analysis plan to differentially reinforce curricular supports that replace students' disruptive behavior in the classroom, pediatric feeding therapy incorporates a liquid chaser and chin feeder to shape proper eating behavior for children with feeding disorders. Habit reversal training, an approach firmly grounded in counterconditioning which uses contingency management procedures to reinforce alternative behavior, is currently the only empirically validated approach for managing tic disorders.

Some studies on exposure (desensitization) therapies—which refer to an array of interventions based on the respondent conditioning procedure known as habituation and typically infuses counterconditioning procedures, such as meditation and breathing exercises—have recently been published in behavior analytic journals since the 1990s, as most other research is conducted from a cognitive-behavior therapy framework. When based on a behavior analytic research standpoint, FBAs are implemented to precisely outline how to employ the flooding form of desensitization (also called direct exposure therapy) for those who are unsuccessful in overcoming their specific phobia through systematic desensitization (also known as graduated exposure therapy). These studies also reveal that systematic desensitization is more effective for children if used in conjunction with shaping, which is further termed contact desensitization, but this comparison has yet to be substantiated with adults.

Other widely published behavior analytic journals include Behavior Modification, The Behavior Analyst, Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science, The Analysis of Verbal Behavior, Behavior and Philosophy, Behavior and Social Issues, and The Psychological Record.

Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a behavior therapy discipline that often overlaps considerably with the clinical behavior analysis subfield of ABA, but differs in that it initially incorporates cognitive restructuring and emotional regulation to alter a person's cognition and emotions. Various forms of CBT have been used to treat physically experienced symptoms that disrupt individuals' livelihood, which often stem from complex mental health disorders. Complications of many trauma-induced disorders result in lack of sleep and nightmares, with cognitive behavior therapy functioning as an intervention found to reduce the average number of PTSD patients suffering from related sleep disturbance.[107]

A popularly noted counseling intervention known as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) includes the use of a chain analysis, as well as cognitive restructuring, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, counterconditioning (mindfulness), and contingency management (positive reinforcement). DBT is quite similar to acceptance and commitment therapy, but contrasts in that it derives from a CBT framework. Although DBT is most widely researched for and empirically validated to reduce the risk of suicide in psychiatric patients with borderline personality disorder, it can often be applied effectively to other mental health conditions, such as substance abuse, as well as mood and eating disorders. A study on BPD was conducted, confirming DBT as a constructive therapeutic option for emotionally unregulated patients. Before DBT, participants with borderline personality disorder were shown images of highly emotional people and neuron activity in the amygdala was recorded via fMRI; after 1 year of consistent dialectical behavior therapy, participants were re-tested, with fMRI capturing a decrease in amygdala hyperactivity (emotional activation) in response to the applied stimulus, exhibiting increases in emotional regulation capabilities.[108]

Most research on exposure therapies (also called desensitization)—ranging from eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy to exposure and response prevention—are conducted through a CBT framework in non-behavior analytic journals, and these enhanced exposure therapies are well-established in the research literature for treating phobic, post-traumatic stress, and other anxiety disorders (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD).

Cognitive-based behavioral activation (BA)—the psychotherapeutic approach used for depression—is shown to be highly effective and is widely used in clinical practice. Some large randomized control trials have indicated that cognitive-based BA is as beneficial as antidepressant medications but more efficacious than traditional cognitive therapy. Other commonly used clinical treatments derived from behavioral learning principles that are often implemented through a CBT model include community reinforcement approach and family training, and habit reversal training for substance abuse and tics, respectively.

Key points included the historical development of behaviorism, starting with Edward Thorndike's law of effect and John B. Watson's methodological behaviorism, which emphasized observable behaviors over introspection. B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism expanded this by including covert behaviors like emotions and cognition under the same controlling variables as observable behaviors, leading to operant conditioning principles. The application of radical behaviorism in various fields such as applied animal behavior, organizational behavior management, and treatment for mental disorders was discussed. The cognitive revolution replaced behaviorism with cognitive psychology, which considers internal mental states as explanations for observable behaviors. Despite theoretical disagreements, cognitive-behavioral therapies have proven effective in treating certain pathologies like PTSD and mood disorders. Skinner's work on verbal behavior and its criticism by Noam Chomsky were noted, highlighting ongoing debates between innateness theory and behavioral accounts of language acquisition. Recent advancements in behavioral informatics were acknowledged for their potential in healthcare interventions through personalized approaches.","[""Scene 1: Warm Welcome\nTLDR: Brief greetings and setting a relaxed tone for the meeting.\n- Exchange casual hellos and smiles\n- Share a light-hearted anecdote or recent personal experience\n- Set expectations for an informal catch-up"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Behaviorism\nTLDR: Discuss the origins and evolution of behaviorism, focusing on key figures like Thorndike and Watson.\n- Psychologist shares insights on Thorndike's law of effect\n- Philosopher reflects on Watson's methodological behaviorism\n- Open floor for spontaneous thoughts or questions"", ""Scene 3: Radical Behaviorism and Operant Conditioning\nTLDR: Explore Skinner's contributions to behaviorism, including operant conditioning principles.\n- Behavior Analyst explains practical applications in therapy and education\n- Educator discusses how these concepts are taught in classrooms\n- Participants share personal experiences with operant conditioning"", ""Scene 4: Cognitive Revolution vs. Behaviorism\nTLDR: Examine the shift from behaviorism to cognitive psychology and its implications.\n- Philosopher outlines theoretical disagreements between the two schools of thought\n- Psychologist highlights effective cognitive-behavioral therapies for mental disorders\n- Encourage debate on innateness theory vs. behavioral accounts of language acquisition"", ""Scene 5: Applied Behavior Analysis in Real World Settings\nTLDR: Discuss real-world impacts of applied behavior analysis across various fields.\n- Behavior Analyst shares success stories from organizational behavior management\n- Educator talks about engaging students using ABA techniques\n- Open discussion on challenges faced in applying ABA"", ""Scene 6: Personal Insights and Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allow space for sharing personal insights or veering off-topic briefly.\n- Participants share non-work-related updates or hobbies they enjoy outside work\n- Encourage laughter and light-hearted exchanges to strengthen team rapport"", ""Scene 7: Future Directions in Behavioral Informatics\nTLDR: Acknowledge advancements in behavioral informatics and potential healthcare interventions.\n- Psychologist discusses personalized approaches in healthcare using informatics tools\n- Philosopher considers ethical implications of data-driven interventions \n - Wrap up with final thoughts or spontaneous ideas""]",">>Educator: Hey everyone! Hope you're all doing well. Yesterday, I had the funniest experience with my students. We were trying to make learning about fractions more engaging, and one of them suggested using pizza slices as examples. It turned into a whole debate about toppings!

>>Psychologist: Haha, that's great! Pizza always gets people talking. Actually, I've been experimenting with role-playing scenarios in therapy sessions lately. One client suggested it, and now it's become a regular part of our sessions.

>>Behavior Analyst: Oh, role-playing sounds fun! I had an amusing moment yesterday too. A client suggested using game mechanics like earning points for good habits. We ended up debating what kind of rewards would be most motivating.

>>Philosopher: That's interesting! Speaking of rewards, I once tried explaining operant conditioning through everyday scenarios to my students. They got so intrigued that they started applying it to their own habits—like rewarding themselves with chocolate for finishing homework.

>>Educator: Chocolate as a reward? That would definitely motivate me! It's amazing how these creative approaches can spark such lively debates.

>>Psychologist: Absolutely! Storytelling in therapy has helped my clients visualize their progress in profound ways. It's wonderful how engaging methods can make such a difference.

>>Behavior Analyst: You know what's funny? I had a client who wanted rewards based on their favorite TV shows—it led to a hilarious discussion about which show offered the best incentives!

>>Philosopher: Haha, TV show rewards sound like fun! It's fascinating how behaviorism weaves into our daily lives in unexpected ways.

>>Educator: So true! These anecdotes really set a relaxed tone for our catch-up today. Sharing experiences like this helps us connect personally before diving deeper into discussions. 
 >>Psychologist: Thorndike's law of effect was a game-changer in understanding behavior. It's fascinating how these ideas have evolved and are now shaping modern therapeutic practices. For instance, I've seen it work wonders in cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions.

>>Philosopher: That's interesting! Watson's focus on observable behaviors certainly shifted psychology towards objectivity. But I'm curious, how do you balance that with the need to consider internal mental states in your practice?

>>Behavior Analyst: Great point! In applied behavior analysis, we use reinforcement techniques to encourage positive behaviors. I recently worked with a child who overcame a fear of dogs using these methods—it's amazing to see such tangible changes.

>>Educator: Speaking of practical applications, I've implemented positive reinforcement strategies in my classroom by using praise and small rewards. Last semester, I noticed a significant boost in student participation during group activities.

>>Psychologist: Absolutely, Skinner's approach really opened doors for therapies that address both external actions and internal experiences. I had a client who struggled with anxiety; combining behavioral techniques with mindfulness made a huge difference.

>>Behavior Analyst: It's incredible how these principles translate into real-world improvements. Just last week, I helped design an intervention plan for a school that improved student engagement through structured playtime activities.

>>Philosopher: While Watson aimed at stripping psychology of subjective elements, it's crucial to acknowledge cognitive processes driving behavior too. How do you see this integration playing out in educational settings?

>>Educator: Well, integrating cognitive aspects has been key in developing critical thinking skills among students. For example, encouraging them to reflect on their learning process has led to deeper understanding and retention of material.

>>Psychologist: That's insightful! The evolution from Watson to Skinner shows how our understanding has broadened over time—embracing both observable behaviors and internal states can lead to more comprehensive approaches in therapy and education. 
 >>Behavior Analyst: You know, Skinner's principles have really transformed therapy techniques. For example, using reinforcement to shape behaviors in children with autism has shown remarkable success. I remember working with a child who struggled with social interactions, and through consistent positive reinforcement, we saw significant improvements. It's fascinating how these methods can be applied across different settings.

>>Educator: Absolutely! In the classroom, operant conditioning can work wonders. I had a student who was always late with homework. By rewarding him with extra recess time for timely submissions, his motivation and engagement skyrocketed. How do you see this playing out in your teaching methods?

>>Psychologist: Looking back at Skinner's work on behavior modification, it's clear that reinforcement is a powerful tool not just for shaping behavior but also for fostering positive change in individuals. I've seen it firsthand in therapy sessions where small rewards lead to big changes over time.

>>Philosopher: That's interesting from a philosophical perspective too. Skinner's ideas challenge us to rethink human agency and autonomy. While operant conditioning offers practical tools for shaping behavior, it raises questions about free will and how much our actions are influenced by external factors.

>>Psychologist: True, Skinner's radical behaviorism does make us reconsider the role of internal states in behavior modification. His work on reinforcement and punishment has practical applications beyond therapy into everyday life—like parenting or personal development.

>>Behavior Analyst: Actually, the practical applications are truly fascinating! In therapy, we often use techniques like token economies to reinforce positive behaviors—rewarding a child with tokens for completing tasks can significantly improve their behavior over time. Isn't it intriguing how these principles adapt across various settings?

>>Philosopher: Indeed! Philosophically speaking, while these techniques provide a framework for predicting and controlling behavior, they compel us to question whether such control diminishes free will's essence.

>>Educator: So true! Think about this—in classrooms using operant conditioning transforms student engagement entirely! Rewarding students with praise or small incentives creates a positive learning environment that enhances motivation and critical thinking skills.

>>Behavior Analyst: Well said! Operant conditioning isn't just about rewards and punishments; it's about understanding environmental contingencies shaping behavior over time. Tailoring interventions to fit individual needs means customizing approaches whether in therapy or education—fascinating how adaptable these principles are!

>>Psychologist: From my perspective—and historically speaking—Skinner's radical behaviorism pushed boundaries regarding internal states versus observable behaviors' relationship... It's fascinating considering his work on reinforcement/punishment applies beyond therapy into everyday situations like parenting/self-improvement... What potential do these principles hold influencing human motivation understanding? 
 >>Philosopher: You know, the cognitive revolution really changed how we think about human behavior. It brought up big questions about consciousness and free will. How do we balance these internal processes with the idea that our actions are just responses to stimuli?
>>Behavior Analyst: That's a great point. Even though behaviorism suggests our actions are influenced by external factors, it doesn't mean we're completely without choice. We can still change our environment and, in turn, our behaviors. It's interesting how this gives us some control over what we do.
>>Psychologist: Absolutely! The shift towards understanding mental states has been crucial, especially in treating disorders like PTSD with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). By combining behavioral techniques with cognitive restructuring, we've seen real progress.
>>Behavior Analyst: Yes, CBT is fascinating because it blends both worlds—behavioral and cognitive approaches—to tackle thought patterns driving behaviors. This combination seems to make treatments more effective.
>>Psychologist: Right! And looking at the history of these fields shows how far we've come—from focusing solely on observable actions to considering internal thoughts too. Balancing these approaches has really enhanced therapeutic practices.
>>Philosopher: It's intriguing from a philosophical standpoint as well. If changing thoughts can alter behaviors, we're acknowledging mental causation alongside external influences. This dual approach opens up new ways of thinking about human agency.
>>Educator: In teaching, we often use interactive methods to engage students with complex ideas. Applying CBT principles could help students not only learn facts but also develop critical thinking skills by questioning their own thought processes.
>>Psychologist: I've seen similar benefits outside therapy too—like in education settings where understanding both behavior and cognition can lead to better learning strategies for students.
>>Behavior Analyst: Exactly! Behavior analysis techniques are versatile enough for classrooms or therapy sessions. By focusing on observable behaviors and reinforcement histories, we can tailor interventions effectively across different environments.
>>Educator: Speaking from experience, using these methods in class helps students become more aware of their learning habits and encourages them to think critically about their own ideas and assumptions. 
 >>Behavior Analyst: Using reinforcement strategies can really boost productivity and morale in companies. It's amazing how a simple change in environment can lead to such positive outcomes.

>>Psychologist: Skinner's approach gives us a solid foundation for understanding behavior analysis today. Integrating cognitive elements has improved treatment outcomes. What challenges do you see in applying these techniques in different settings?

>>Philosopher: It's interesting to consider how these techniques might affect personal choice and motivation. If our behaviors are shaped by external factors, what does that mean for personal choice?

>>Educator: Imagine using ABA techniques to keep students engaged and motivated. How would you apply this in your classroom?

>>Psychologist: One challenge with ABA is ensuring interventions are tailored to individual needs while maintaining consistency. In educational environments, it's crucial to adapt reinforcement strategies to suit diverse learning styles and developmental stages. How do you balance individualized approaches with standardized methods?

>>Behavior Analyst: Adapting ABA techniques to different cultures is challenging but rewarding. For example, in some cultures, group rewards might be more effective than individual ones.

>>Philosopher: The implications of tailoring reinforcement strategies to cultural contexts challenge our understanding of universal human agency. If choices are shaped by culturally specific motivators, does it not imply that autonomy is influenced by external factors? Perhaps we should explore whether these adaptations truly enhance or constrain personal freedom.

>>Educator: So when we apply ABA techniques in educational settings, it's like crafting a unique learning experience for each student. By understanding what motivates them, we can tailor interventions that boost engagement and foster critical thinking.

>>Psychologist: Integrating cognitive elements into ABA allows for a personalized approach across various fields. How do you think this could work in organizational settings?

>>Behavior Analyst: That's a great point! In organizations, we could tailor interventions based on individual motivations. 
 >>Educator: You know, speaking of hobbies, I've recently taken up gardening. It's amazing how therapeutic it can be to just dig in the dirt and watch things grow. Anyone else have a hobby that helps them unwind?

>>Psychologist: Absolutely! Gardening sounds wonderful. I find painting really relaxing. It lets me disconnect from daily stress and just focus on creating something beautiful. How do you feel when you're out there in the garden?

>>Behavior Analyst: Well, I've been experimenting with cooking lately. It's like a mini science experiment every time I try a new recipe. Plus, the reward of a delicious meal at the end is quite satisfying! Anyone else have a hobby that feels like an adventure?

>>Philosopher: Cooking does sound like an adventure! For me, reading is my escape. Diving into different worlds through books gives me a sense of freedom and choice—like I'm exploring new territories without leaving my home.

>>Psychologist: That's fascinating! Hobbies really do give our minds a break from the daily grind. Painting helps me tap into my creative side and forget about everything else for a while.

>>Behavior Analyst: From a behavioral standpoint, hobbies like cooking can be quite fascinating! They provide a sense of accomplishment and serve as practical applications of reinforcement principles. Isn't it intriguing how the anticipation of a tasty dish can motivate us to try new recipes?

>>Educator: Imagine this: you're in a classroom, and suddenly, a student starts talking about their favorite hobby—say, painting. How would you apply operant conditioning principles to encourage them? We can use positive reinforcement to boost creativity and engagement.

>>Philosopher: Philosophically speaking, when we immerse ourselves in hobbies, are we not engaging in existential exploration? These pursuits might indeed serve as mirrors reflecting our quest for meaning and autonomy but also challenge us to ponder fulfillment beyond mere leisure.

>>Psychologist: In my experience, hobbies can be powerful tools for mental health. They provide an outlet for stress and ways to express creativity—like giving our minds a break from the daily grind.

>>Behavior Analyst: Wow! Cooking really does feel like an adventure. Each recipe is a new challenge; anyone else have a hobby that feels like a journey?

>>Educator: You know, it's interesting how hobbies sometimes teach us more than we expect. When I'm gardening, I often find myself thinking about patience and care—it’s similar to teaching!

>>Philosopher: Indeed! When we delve into hobbies, are we not engaging in subtle dances between autonomy and structure? These pursuits might serve as canvases upon which we paint desires but also reflect deeper existential questions about freedom. 
 >>Psychologist: You know, the way we're using technology to personalize healthcare is really exciting. We can now tailor treatments based on individual needs, which could lead to better outcomes. Let's explore that a bit more.

>>Behavior Analyst: Absolutely! From my perspective, using real-time data in healthcare can change how we approach interventions. It's amazing how we can adjust strategies based on what people actually do and want. Technology is really helping us understand behavior better!

>>Philosopher: That's true! But it also makes me wonder about the ethical side of things—like privacy and autonomy. Are we turning people into just data points? And what does consent mean when algorithms are making decisions for us?

>>Educator: Imagine if we applied this in schools! We could customize learning experiences for each student, making education more engaging and effective. How would you see this working in your area?

>>(Phone rings loudly)

>>(Everyone pauses)

>>Psychologist (smiling): Well, that's a reminder of our tech-driven world! Anyway, historically speaking, we've built a strong foundation with behaviorism and cognitive approaches. Now with these tools, we can understand behaviors better and create personalized interventions while respecting people's choices.

>>Behavior Analyst (jumping in): Speaking of choices—how do you think these ethical concerns might affect public trust in these technologies?

>>Philosopher: Great question! Trust is key here. If algorithms start dictating health choices, it might feel like we're losing control over our own decisions. Consent becomes tricky then.

>>Behavior Analyst: Right! And it's fascinating how using data not only helps tailor interventions but also predicts health risks before they happen. This proactive approach could really change patient care!

>>Educator: Exactly—and in education too! Personalized learning paths that adapt to each student's pace could boost motivation because students feel their learning is truly tailored to them.

>>(Psychologist nods): By understanding past behaviors and the environment's impact on actions—we can use these tools for personalized care while ensuring patients have control over their treatment options."
