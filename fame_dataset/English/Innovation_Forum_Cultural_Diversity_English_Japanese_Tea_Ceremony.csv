Japanese Tea Ceremony,"The Japanese tea ceremony (known as sadō/chadō (茶道, 'The Way of Tea') or chanoyu (茶の湯) lit. 'Hot water for tea') is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha (抹茶), powdered green tea, the procedure of which is called temae (点前).[1]

The term ""Japanese tea ceremony"" does not exist in the Japanese language. In Japanese the term is Sadō or Chadō, which literally translated means ""tea way"" and places the emphasis on the Tao (道). The English term ""Teaism"" was coined by Okakura Kakuzō to describe the unique worldview associated with Japanese way of tea as opposed to focusing just on the presentation aspect, which came across to the first western observers as ceremonial in nature.[2]

In the 1500s, Sen no Rikyū revolutionized Japanese tea culture, essentially perfecting what is now known as the Japanese tea ceremony and elevating it to the status of an art form. He redefined the rules of the tea house, tea garden, utensils, and procedures of the tea ceremony with his own interpretation, introduced a much smaller chashitsu (tea house) and rustic, distorted ceramic tea bowls specifically for the tea ceremony, and perfected the tea ceremony based on the aesthetic sense of wabi.[3][4][5]

Sen no Rikyū's great-grandchildren founded the Omotesenke, Urasenke, and Mushakōjisenke schools of tea ceremony, and the tea ceremony spread not only to daimyo (feudal lords) and the samurai class but also to the general public, leading to the establishment of various tea ceremony schools that continue to this day.[6]

Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the culture of Japanese tea. Shinto has also greatly influenced the Japanese tea ceremony. For example, the practice of purifying one's hands and mouth before practicing the tea ceremony is influenced by the Shinto purification ritual of misogi. The architectural style of the chashitsu and the gate that serves as the boundary between the tea garden and the secular world have been influenced by Shinto shrine architecture and the torii (shrine gate).[7]

Much less commonly, Japanese tea practice uses leaf tea, primarily sencha, a practice known as senchadō (煎茶道, 'the way of sencha').

Tea gatherings are classified as either an informal tea gathering (chakai (茶会, 'tea gathering')) or a formal tea gathering (chaji (茶事, 'tea event')). A chakai is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes wagashi (confections), thin tea, and perhaps a light meal. A chaji is a much more formal gathering, usually including a full-course kaiseki meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea. A chaji may last up to four hours.

The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century. It is found in an entry in the Nihon Kōki having to do with the Buddhist monk Eichū (永忠), who had brought some tea back to Japan on his return from Tang China. The entry states that Eichū personally prepared and served sencha (tea beverage made by steeping tea leaves in hot water) to Emperor Saga, who was on an excursion in Karasaki (in present Shiga Prefecture) in 815. By imperial order in 816, tea plantations began to be cultivated in the Kinki region of Japan.[8] However, the interest in tea in Japan faded after this.[9]

In China, tea had already been known, according to legend, for more than three thousand years (though the earliest archaeological evidence of tea-drinking dates to the 2nd century BCE). The form of tea popular in China in Eichū's time was dancha (団茶, ""cake tea"" or ""brick tea"")[10] – tea compressed into a nugget in the same manner as the pu-er tea is today. This then would be ground in a mortar, and the resulting ground tea mixed together with various other herbs and flavourings.[11] The custom of drinking tea, first for medicinal, and then largely for pleasurable reasons, was already widespread throughout China. In the early 9th century, Chinese author Lu Yu wrote The Classic of Tea, a treatise on tea focusing on its cultivation and preparation. Lu Yu's life had been heavily influenced by Buddhism, particularly the Zen–Chán Buddhist school. His ideas would have a strong influence in the development of the Japanese tea.[12]

Around the end of the 12th century, the style of tea preparation called tencha (点茶), in which powdered matcha was placed into a bowl, hot water added, and the tea and hot water whipped together, was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monk Eisai on his return from China. He also took tea seeds back with him, which eventually produced tea that was considered to be the most superb quality in all of Japan.[13] This powdered green tea was first used in religious rituals in Buddhist monasteries. By the 13th century, when the Kamakura shogunate ruled the nation and tea and the luxuries associated with it became a kind of status symbol among the warrior class, there arose tōcha (闘茶, ""tea tasting"") parties wherein contestants could win extravagant prizes for guessing the best quality tea – that was grown in Kyoto, deriving from the seeds that Eisai brought from China.

The next major period in Japanese history was the Muromachi period, pointing to the rise of Kitayama Culture (ja:北山文化, Kitayama bunka), centered around the cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his villa in the northern hills of Kyoto (Kinkaku-ji), and later during this period, the rise of Higashiyama culture, centered around the elegant cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimasa and his retirement villa in the eastern hills of Kyoto (Ginkaku-ji). This period, approximately 1336 to 1573, saw the budding of what is generally regarded as Japanese traditional culture as it is known today.

The use of Japanese tea developed as a ""transformative practice"" and began to evolve its own aesthetic, in particular that of wabi-sabi principles. Wabi represents the inner, or spiritual, experiences of human lives. Its original meaning indicated quiet or sober refinement, or subdued taste ""characterized by humility, restraint, simplicity, naturalism, profundity, imperfection, and asymmetry"" and ""emphasizes simple, unadorned objects and architectural space, and celebrates the mellow beauty that time and care impart to materials.""[14]

Sabi, on the other hand, represents the outer, or material side of life. Originally, it meant ""worn"", ""weathered"", or ""decayed"". Particularly among the nobility, understanding emptiness was considered the most effective means to spiritual awakening, while embracing imperfection was honoured as a reminder to cherish one's unpolished and unfinished nature – considered to be the first step to satori, or enlightenment.[15] 
Central are the concepts of omotenashi, which revolves around hospitality.

Murata Jukō is known in chanoyu history as an early developer of tea as a spiritual practice. He studied Zen under the monk Ikkyū, who revitalized Zen in the 15th century, and this is considered to have influenced his concept of chanoyu.[16]
By the 16th century, tea drinking had spread to all levels of society in Japan. Sen no Rikyū and his work Southern Record, perhaps the best-known – and still revered – historical figure in tea, followed his master Takeno Jōō's concept of ichi-go ichi-e, a philosophy that each meeting should be treasured, for it can never be reproduced. His teachings perfected many newly developed forms in architecture and gardens, art, and the full development of the ""way of tea"". The principles he set forward – harmony (和, wa), respect (敬, kei), purity (清, sei), and tranquility (寂, jaku) – are still central to tea.[17]

Sen no Rikyū was the leading teamaster of the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who greatly supported him in codifying and spreading the way of tea, also as a means of solidifying his own political power. Hideyoshi's tastes were influenced by his teamaster, but nevertheless he also had his own ideas to cement his power such as constructing the Golden Tea Room and hosting the Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony in 1587. The symbiotic relationship between politics and tea was at its height. However, it was increasingly at odds with the rustic and simple aesthetics continuously advertised by his tea master, which the regent increasingly saw as a threat to cementing his own power and position, and their once close relationship began to suffer. 

In 1590, one of the leading disciples of Rikyu, Yamanoue Sōji, was brutally executed on orders of the regent. One year later the regent ordered his teamaster to commit ritual suicide. The way of tea was never so closely intertwined with politics before or after. After the death of Rikyū, essentially three schools descended from him to continue the tradition. The way of tea continued to spread throughout the country and later developed not only from the court and samurai class, but also towards the townspeople. Many schools of Japanese tea ceremony have evolved through the long history of chadō and are active today.

Japanese tea ceremonies are typically conducted in specially constructed spaces or rooms designed for the purpose of tea ceremony. While a purpose-built tatami-floored room is considered the ideal venue, any place where the necessary implements for the making and serving of the tea can be set out and where the host can make the tea in the presence of the seated guest(s) can be used as a venue for tea. For instance, a tea gathering can be held picnic-style in the outdoors, known as nodate (野点). For this occasion a red parasol called nodatekasa (野点傘) is used. 

A purpose-built room designed for the wabi style of tea is called a chashitsu, and is ideally 4.5-tatami in floor area. A purpose-built chashitsu typically has a low ceiling, a hearth built into the floor, an alcove for hanging scrolls and placing other decorative objects, and separate entrances for host and guests. It also has an attached preparation area known as a mizuya.

A 4.5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used. Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in wabi style tea rooms. Chashitsu can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea. Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea garden called a roji.

Seasonality and the changing of the seasons are considered important for enjoyment of tea and tea ceremony. Traditionally, tea practitioners divide the year into two main seasons: the sunken hearth (炉, ro) season, constituting the colder months (traditionally November to April), and the brazier (風炉, furo) season, constituting the warmer months (traditionally May to October).

For each season, there are variations in the temae performed and utensils and other equipment used. Ideally, the configuration of the tatami in a 4.5 mat room changes with the season as well.

During the sunken hearth season, the Chajin opens the sunken hearth in the middle of the tea room. Water is heated using the sunken hearth. The sunken hearth is the only form of heat in the room during the winter. During the brazier season, water is heated in a raised brazier.[18] The weather determines the exact time to use the sunken hearth or brazier. During the time of year when the brazier does not provide enough heat to the room for the guests to be warm, but the hearth was too warm, the Chajin could cover the hearth with the lid, and put the brazier on top of it.[19]

The location of the hearth or brazier is the biggest change between seasons, however, there are many other changes that are made, such as the incense, utensils, and clothing worn. During the winter, a type of incense known as Neriko, a type of incense that is formed into pellets, is used. Jin or Byakudan are used in the summer, and during the end of spring or the beginning of autumn, the Chajin puts out Kokukobei or Umegako.[20] Guests drink tea from a more cylindrical style of bowl in the winter to keep in heat, and use a flat bowl in the summer to release heat. Different designs are depicted on the tea bowl based on the season.[21] During the summer, participants wear a kimono  made up of one layer to ensure that it is not too hot. However, outside the summer, participants wear a double-layered kimono so they will be warmer.[22]

There are two main ways of preparing matcha for tea consumption: thick (濃茶, koicha) and thin (薄茶, usucha), with the best quality tea leaves used in preparing thick tea. Historically, the tea leaves used as packing material for the koicha leaves in the tea urn (茶壺, chatsubo) would be served as thin tea. Japanese historical documents about tea that differentiate between usucha and koicha first appear in the Tenmon era (1532–1555).[23] The first documented appearance of the term koicha is in 1575.[24]

As the terms imply, koicha is a thick blend of matcha and hot water that requires about three times as much tea to the equivalent amount of water than usucha. To prepare usucha, matcha and hot water are whipped using the tea whisk (茶筅, chasen), while koicha is kneaded with the whisk to smoothly blend the large amount of powdered tea with the water.

The host serves thin tea to each guest in an individual bowl, while one bowl of thick tea is shared among several guests. This style of sharing a bowl of koicha first appeared in historical documents in 1586, and is a method considered to have been invented by Sen no Rikyū.[24]

The most important part of a chaji is the preparation and drinking of koicha, which is followed by usucha. A chakai may involve only the preparation and serving of thin tea (and accompanying confections), representing the more relaxed, finishing portion of a chaji.

The equipment for tea ceremony is called chadōgu (茶道具). A wide range of chadōgu is available and different styles and motifs are used for different events and in different seasons. All the tools for tea are handled with exquisite care, being scrupulously cleaned before and after each use and before storing, with some handled only with gloved hands. Some items, such as the tea storage jar which has the name Chigusa, are so revered that, historically, they were given proper names like people, and were admired and documented by multiple diarists.[25] The honorary title Senke Jusshoku [ja] is given to the ten artisans that provide the utensils for the events held by the three primary iemoto Schools of Japanese tea known as the san-senke.[26]

Some of the more essential components of tea ceremony are:

Procedures vary from school to school, and with the time of year, time of day, venue, and other considerations. The noon tea gathering of one host and a maximum of five guests is considered the most formal chaji. The following is a general description of a noon chaji held in the cool weather season at a purpose-built tea house.

The guests arrive a little before the appointed time and enter an interior waiting room, where they store unneeded items such as coats, and put on fresh tabi socks. Ideally, the waiting room has a tatami floor and an alcove (tokonoma), in which is displayed a hanging scroll which may allude to the season, the theme of the chaji, or some other appropriate theme.

The guests are served a cup of the hot water, kombu tea, roasted barley tea, or sakurayu. When all the guests have arrived and finished their preparations, they proceed to the outdoor waiting bench in the roji, where they remain until summoned by the host.

Following a silent bow between host and guests, the guests proceed in order to a tsukubai (stone basin) where they ritually purify themselves by washing their hands and rinsing their mouths with water, and then continue along the roji to the tea house. They remove their footwear and enter the tea room through a small ""crawling-in"" door (nijiri-guchi), and proceed to view the items placed in the tokonoma and any tea equipment placed ready in the room, and are then seated seiza-style on the tatami in order of prestige.

When the last guest has taken their place, they close the door with an audible sound to alert the host, who enters the tea room and welcomes each guest, and then answers questions posed by the first guest about the scroll and other items.

The chaji begins in the cool months with the laying of the charcoal fire which is used to heat the water. Following this, guests are served a meal in several courses accompanied by sake and followed by a small sweet (wagashi) eaten from special paper called kaishi (懐紙), which each guest carries, often in a decorative wallet or tucked into the breast of the kimono.[27] After the meal, there is a break called a nakadachi (中立ち) during which the guests return to the waiting shelter until summoned again by the host, who uses the break to sweep the tea room, take down the scroll and replace it with a flower arrangement, open the tea room's shutters, and make preparations for serving the tea.

Having been summoned back to the tea room by the sound of a bell or gong rung in prescribed ways, the guests again purify themselves and examine the items placed in the tea room. The host then enters, ritually cleanses each utensil – including the tea bowl, whisk, and tea scoop – in the presence of the guests in a precise order and using prescribed motions, and places them in an exact arrangement according to the particular temae procedure being performed. When the preparation of the utensils is complete, the host prepares thick tea.

Bows are exchanged between the host and the guest receiving the tea. The guest then bows to the second guest, and raises the bowl in a gesture of respect to the host. The guest rotates the bowl to avoid drinking from its front, takes a sip, and compliments the host on the tea. After taking a few sips, the guest wipes clean the rim of the bowl and passes it to the second guest. The procedure is repeated until all guests have taken tea from the same bowl; each guest then has an opportunity to admire the bowl before it is returned to the host, who then cleanses the equipment and leaves the tea room.

The host then rekindles the fire and adds more charcoal. This signifies a change from the more formal portion of the gathering to the more casual portion, and the host will return to the tea room to bring in a smoking set (タバコ盆, tabako-bon) and more confections, usually higashi, to accompany the thin tea, and possibly cushions for the guests' comfort.

The host will then proceed with the preparation of an individual bowl of thin tea to be served to each guest. While in earlier portions of the gathering conversation is limited to a few formal comments exchanged between the first guest and the host, in the usucha portion, after a similar ritual exchange, the guests may engage in casual conversation.

After all the guests have taken tea, the host cleans the utensils in preparation for putting them away. The guest of honour will request that the host allow the guests to examine some of the utensils, and each guest in turn examines each item, including the tea caddy and the tea scoop. (This examination is done to show respect and admiration for the host.)[28] The items are treated with extreme care and reverence as they may be priceless, irreplaceable, handmade antiques, and guests often use a special brocaded cloth to handle them.

The host then collects the utensils, and the guests leave the tea house. The host bows from the door, and the gathering is over. A tea gathering can last up to four hours, depending on the type of occasion performed, the number of guests, and the types of meal and tea served.

Every action in chadō – how a kettle is used, how a teacup is examined, how tea is scooped into a cup – is performed in a very specific way, and may be thought of as a procedure or technique. The procedures performed in chadō are known collectively as temae. The act of performing these procedures during a chaji is called ""doing temae"".[29]

There are many styles of temae, depending upon the school, occasion, season, setting, equipment, and countless other possible factors. The following is a short, general list of common types of temae.[30]

Chabako temae (茶箱手前) is so called because the equipment is removed from and then replaced into a special box known as a chabako (茶箱, lit. 'tea box'). Chabako developed as a convenient way to prepare the necessary equipment for making tea outdoors. The basic equipment contained in the chabako are the tea bowl, tea whisk (kept in a special container), tea scoop and tea caddy, and linen wiping cloth in a special container, as well as a container for little candy-like sweets. Many of the items are smaller than usual, to fit in the box. This gathering takes approximately 35–40 minutes.[31]

Hakobi temae (運び手前) is so called because, except for the hot water kettle (and brazier if a sunken hearth is not being used), the essential items for the tea-making, including even the fresh water container, are carried into the tea room by the host as a part of the temae. In other temae, the water jar and perhaps other items, depending upon the style of temae, are placed in the tea room before the guests enter.[32]

Obon temae (お盆手前), bon temae (盆手前), or bonryaku temae (盆略手前) is a simple procedure for making usucha (thin tea). The tea bowl, tea whisk, tea scoop, chakin and tea caddy are placed on a tray, and the hot water is prepared in a kettle called a tetsubin, which is heated on a brazier. This is usually the first temae learned, and is the easiest to perform, requiring neither much specialized equipment nor a lot of time to complete. It may easily be done sitting at a table, or outdoors, using a thermos pot in place of the tetsubin and portable hearth.[32]

In the ryūrei (立礼) style, the tea is prepared with the host seated on a chair at a special table, and the guests also seated on chairs at tables. It is possible, therefore, for ryūrei-style temae to be conducted nearly anywhere, even outdoors. The name refers to the host's practice of performing the first and last bows while standing. In ryūrei there is usually an assistant who sits near the host and moves the host's seat out of the way as needed for standing or sitting. The assistant also serves the tea and sweets to the guests. This procedure originated in the Urasenke school, initially for serving non-Japanese guests who, it was thought, would be more comfortable sitting on chairs.[32]

The Japanese traditional floor mats, tatami, are used in various ways in tea offerings. Their placement, for example, determines how a person walks through the tea room chashitsu, and the different seating positions.

The use of tatami flooring has influenced the development of tea. For instance, when walking on tatami it is customary to shuffle, to avoid causing disturbance. Shuffling forces one to slow down, to maintain erect posture, and to walk quietly, and helps one to maintain balance as the combination of tabi and tatami makes for a slippery surface; it is also a function of wearing kimono, which restricts stride length. One must avoid walking on the joins between mats, one practical reason being that that would tend to damage the tatami. Therefore, tea students are taught to step over such joins when walking in the tea room.

The placement of tatami in tea rooms differs slightly from the normal placement in regular Japanese-style rooms, and may also vary by season (where it is possible to rearrange the mats). In a 4.5 mat room, the mats are placed in a circular pattern around a centre mat. Purpose-built tea rooms have a sunken hearth in the floor which is used in winter. A special tatami is used which has a cut-out section providing access to the hearth. In summer, the hearth is covered either with a small square of extra tatami, or, more commonly, the hearth tatami is replaced with a full mat, totally hiding the hearth.

It is customary to avoid stepping on this centre mat whenever possible, as well as to avoid placing the hands palm-down on it, as it functions as a kind of table: tea utensils are placed on it for viewing, and prepared bowls of tea are placed on it for serving to the guests. To avoid stepping on it people may walk around it on the other mats, or shuffle on the hands and knees.

Except when walking, when moving about on the tatami one places one's closed fists on the mats and uses them to pull oneself forward or push backwards while maintaining a seiza position.

There are dozens of real and imaginary lines that crisscross any tearoom. These are used to determine the exact placement of utensils and myriad other details; when performed by skilled practitioners, the placement of utensils will vary minutely from gathering to gathering. The lines in tatami mats (畳目, tatami-me) are used as one guide for placement, and the joins serve as a demarcation indicating where people should sit.

Tatami provide a more comfortable surface for sitting seiza-style. At certain times of year (primarily during the new year's festivities) the portions of the tatami where guests sit may be covered with a red felt cloth.

Calligraphy, mainly in the form of hanging scrolls, plays a central role in tea. Scrolls, often written by famous calligraphers or Buddhist monks, are hung in the tokonoma (scroll alcove) of the tea room. They are selected for their appropriateness for the occasion, including the season and the theme of the particular get-together. Calligraphic scrolls may feature well-known sayings, particularly those associated with Buddhism, poems, descriptions of famous places, or words or phrases associated with tea.[33]

Historian and author Haga Kōshirō points out that it is clear from the teachings of Sen no Rikyū recorded in the Nanpō roku that the suitability of any particular scroll for a tea gathering depends not only on the subject of the writing itself but also on the virtue of the writer. Haga points out that Rikyū preferred to hang bokuseki (""ink traces""), the calligraphy of Zen Buddhist priests, in the tea room.[34] A typical example of a hanging scroll in a tea room might have the kanji wa-kei-sei-jaku (和敬清寂, ""harmony"", ""respect"", ""purity"" and ""tranquility""), expressing the four key principles of the Way of Tea. Some contain only a single character; in summer, kaze (風, ""wind"") would be appropriate. Hanging scrolls that feature a painting instead of calligraphy, or a combination of both, are also used. Scrolls are sometimes placed in the waiting room as well.

Chabana (literally ""tea flower"") is the simple style of flower arrangement used in tea rooms. Chabana has its roots in ikebana, an older style of Japanese flower arranging, which itself has roots in Shinto and Buddhism.

It evolved from the ""free-form"" style of ikebana called nageirebana (投げ入れ, ""throw-in flowers""), which was used by early tea masters. Chabana is said, depending upon the source, to have been either developed or championed by Sen no Rikyū. He is said to have taught that chabana should give the viewer the same impression that those flowers naturally would give if they were still growing outdoors, in nature.

Unnatural or out-of-season materials are never used, as well as props and other devices. The containers in which chabana are arranged are referred to generically as hanaire (花入れ). Chabana arrangements typically comprise few items, and little or no filler material. In the summer, when many flowering grasses are in season in Japan, however, it is seasonally appropriate to arrange a number of such flowering grasses in an airy basket-type container. Unlike ikebana (which often uses shallow, wide dishes), tall, narrow hanaire are frequently used in chabana. The containers for the flowers used in tea rooms are typically made from natural materials such as bamboo, as well as metal or ceramic, but rarely glass as ikebana (another flower arrangement) uses short, glass vases.

Chabana arrangements are so simple that frequently no more than a single blossom is used; this blossom will invariably lean towards or face the guests.[35]

Kaiseki (懐石) or cha-kaiseki (茶懐石) is a meal served in the context of a formal tea function. In cha-kaiseki, only fresh seasonal ingredients are used, prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavour. Great care is taken in selecting ingredients and types of food, and the finished dishes are carefully presented on serving ware that is chosen to enhance the appearance and seasonal theme of the meal. Dishes are intricately arranged and garnished, often with real edible leaves and flowers that are to help enhance the flavour of the food. Serving ware and garnishes are as much a part of the kaiseki experience as the food; some might argue that the aesthetic experience of seeing the food is even more important than the physical experience of eating it.

Courses are served in small servings in individual dishes. Each diner has a small lacquered tray to themselves; very important people may be provided their own low, lacquered table or several small tables.

Because cha-kaiseki generally follows traditional eating habits in Japan, meat dishes are rare.

Many of the movements and components of tea ceremonies evolved from the wearing of kimono. For example, certain movements are designed to keep dangling sleeves out of the way or prevent them from becoming dirty. Other motions allow for the straightening of the kimono and the hakama.[36]

Some aspects of tea ceremony – such as the use of silk fukusa cloths – cannot be performed without wearing a kimono and obi, or a belt substitute, as the cloth is folded and tucked into the obi within the ceremony. Other items, such as kaishi, smaller cloths known as kobukusa (小袱紗), and fans, require kimono collars, sleeves and the obi worn with them in order to be used throughout the ceremony; otherwise, a substitute for storing these items on the person must be found.[37]

For this reason, most tea ceremonies are conducted in kimono, and though students may practice wearing Western clothes, students of tea ceremony will need to wear kimono at some point. On formal occasions, the host of the tea ceremony will always wear kimono, and for guests, formal kimono or Western formal wear must be worn. No matter the style of clothing, the attire worn at a tea gathering is usually subdued and conservative, so as not to be distracting.

For women, the type of kimono worn is usually an iromuji – a solid-colour, unpatterned kimono, worn with a nagoya obi in an appropriate tanmono fabric; slub-weave silks, shibori patterns and generally bright-coloured obi are not worn. Edo komon kimono may also be worn, as their patterns are small enough as to be unobtrusive.[38]

Men may wear kimono only, or (for more formal occasions) a combination of kimono and hakama (a long, divided or undivided skirt worn over the kimono). Those who have earned the right may wear a kimono with a jittoku (十徳) or juttoku jacket instead of hakama.

Women wear various styles of kimono depending on the season and the event; women generally do not wear hakama for tea occasions, and do not gain the right to wear a jittoku.

Lined kimono are worn by both men and women in the winter months, and unlined kimono are worn in the summer. For formal occasions, montsuki kimono (紋付着物) (kimono with three to five family crests on the sleeves and back) are worn. Both men and women wear white tabi (divided-toe socks).

In Japan, those who wish to study tea ceremony typically join a ""circle"", a generic term for a group that meets regularly to participate in a given activity. There are also tea clubs at many junior and high schools, colleges and universities.

Classes may be held at community centres, dedicated tea schools, or at private homes. Tea schools often teach a wide variety of pupils who may study at different times; for example, the school may have a group for women, a group for older students, and a group for younger students. Students normally pay a monthly fee which covers tuition and the use of the school's (or teacher's) bowls and other equipment, the tea itself, and the sweets that students serve and eat at every class. Students must be equipped with their own fukusa, fan, kaishi paper, and kobukusa, as well as their own wallet in which to place these items. 

Though some groups and practitioners of tea ceremony may wear Western clothing, for most occasions of tea ceremony – particularly if the teacher is highly ranked within the tradition – wearing kimono is mostly considered essential, in particular for women. In some cases, advanced students may be given permission to wear the school's mark in place of the usual family crests on formal kimono. This permission usually accompanies the granting of a chamei, or ""tea name"", to the student.

New students typically begin by observing more advanced students as they practice. New students may be taught mostly by more advanced students; the most advanced students are taught exclusively by the teacher. The first things new students learn are how to correctly open and close sliding doors, how to walk on tatami, how to enter and exit the tea room, how to bow and to whom and when to do so, how to wash, store and care for the various equipment, how to fold the fukusa, how to ritually clean tea equipment, and how to wash and fold chakin. As they master these essential steps, students are also taught how to behave as a guest at tea ceremonies: the correct words to say, how to handle bowls, how to drink tea and eat sweets, how to use paper and sweet-picks, and myriad other details.

As they master the basics, students will be instructed on how to prepare the powdered tea for use, how to fill the tea caddy, and finally, how to measure the tea and water and whisk it to the proper consistency. Once these basic steps have been mastered, students begin to practice the simplest temae, typically beginning with O-bon temae. Only when the first offering has been mastered will students move on. Study is through observation and hands on practice; students do not often take notes, and many teachers discourage the practice of note-taking.

As they master each offering, some schools and teachers present students with certificates at a formal ceremony. According to the school, this certificate may warrant that the student has mastered a given temae, or may give the student permission to begin studying a given temae. Acquiring such certificates is often very costly; the student typically must not only pay for the preparation of the certificate itself and for participating in the gathering during which it is bestowed, but is also expected to thank the teacher by presenting him or her with a gift of money. The cost of acquiring certificates increases as the student's level increases.

Typically, each class ends with the whole group being given brief instruction by the main teacher, usually concerning the contents of the tokonoma (the scroll alcove, which typically features a hanging scroll (usually with calligraphy), a flower arrangement, and occasionally other objects as well) and the sweets that have been served that day. Related topics include incense and kimono, or comments on seasonal variations in equipment or offerings.

Like the formal traditions of matcha, there are formal traditions of sencha, distinguished as senchadō, typically involving the high-grade gyokuro class of sencha. This offering, more Chinese in style, was introduced to Japan in the 17th century by Ingen, the founder of the Ōbaku school of Zen Buddhism, also more Chinese in style than earlier schools. In the 18th century, it was popularized by the Ōbaku monk Baisao, who sold tea in Kyoto, and later came to be regarded as the first sencha master.[39][40] It remains associated with the Ōbaku school, and the head temple of Manpuku-ji hosts regular sencha tea conventions.

As we embark on this journey together, let's consider the historical context and cultural significance of the Japanese tea ceremony. Our goal is to explore its evolution and how these timeless rituals can bring harmony and tranquility into our daily lives.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: I'm glad we're all here today. Reflecting on Zen principles, we can discuss how they have influenced the Japanese tea ceremony and how these teachings can bring mindfulness into our lives.

>>Tea Master: Hello everyone! As we delve into the intricacies of the Japanese tea ceremony, let's appreciate its practical applications in our daily routines. Notice how each step—from preparing matcha to arranging utensils—embodies mindfulness and respect.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: The Japanese tea ceremony isn't just about drinking tea; it's also about social dynamics and cultural significance embedded in each step. From my research, these rituals foster community and respect among participants. How do you think we can apply these principles in our own social interactions?

>>Cultural Historian: That's a great point about fostering community through rituals. Historically, these ceremonies were also a way for different social classes to interact respectfully.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Indeed, it's fascinating how such practices promote equality and mindfulness regardless of one's status.

>>Tea Master: Absolutely! And personally, I've found that incorporating some elements of these ceremonies into my daily routine has helped me stay grounded and focused. 
 >>Cultural Historian: Yes, the historical evolution of the Japanese tea ceremony is truly fascinating. Sen no Rikyū's influence in the 16th century was pivotal. He really shaped what we now recognize as chanoyu by emphasizing wabi-sabi principles—embracing simplicity and imperfection.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Absolutely, and Zen Buddhism's influence is deeply woven into the tea ceremony. In each moment of stillness, we can see a reflection of our inner state. Every deliberate movement and mindful gesture invites us to embrace simplicity and imperfection, guiding us towards a deeper understanding of ourselves.

>>Tea Master: Right, and you can see these principles in action when we prepare matcha. We use rustic, handmade bowls that celebrate imperfection and simplicity. This practice reminds us to find beauty in the imperfect and transient nature of life.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's so true! From my research, it's clear that the social dynamics within the tea ceremony are profound. The roles of host and guest create a unique interplay of respect and humility. For example—

>>Zen Buddhist Monk (politely): If I may add something here... How do these gestures specifically reinforce social hierarchies?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Sure! Each gesture is designed to show respect and humility. When bowing or serving tea, there's an implicit acknowledgment of one's role within this microcosm. It reinforces social structures by emphasizing mutual respect and community values.

>>Cultural Historian: Exactly! And Sen no Rikyū's introduction of rustic chashitsu and imperfect ceramic bowls was revolutionary at the time. It wasn't just about aesthetics; it had a deep spiritual significance too.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Yes, it also reminds us about mindfulness while brewing tea... Each step—from whisking matcha to savoring its taste—is an invitation to be fully present.

>>Tea Master: Notice how this emphasis on simplicity aligns with mindfulness principles too. Every step invites full presence.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Speaking from my own experience attending several ceremonies, it's fascinating how these events serve as a microcosm for Japanese society itself. 
 >>Zen Buddhist Monk: In the stillness of the tea ceremony, we find a reflection of our inner state. How can this practice help us cultivate mindfulness in other areas of our lives?

>>Tea Master: Absolutely. Each movement in preparing tea is deliberate and mindful. This practice helps us stay present and focused, which can be really beneficial in managing daily stress.

>>Cultural Historian: It's interesting how these rituals have evolved from Shinto traditions to include Zen practices. It really shows how cultural influences shape our understanding of mindfulness.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: I agree with what was said about societal values reflected in the tea ceremony. In my research, I've seen similar practices in other cultures too—how do you think these compare?

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: The tea ceremony isn't just about making tea; it's a way to practice mindfulness. How do you think we can apply this level of focus to our everyday tasks?

>>Tea Master: Well, as we prepare the tea, appreciating the simplicity and elegance of each movement can remind us to slow down and be present even when we're doing mundane tasks like washing dishes or walking.

>>Cultural Historian: Indeed, the historical evolution of the tea ceremony is a testament to its profound cultural significance. From its roots in Shinto purification rituals to Zen Buddhist influence emphasizing mindfulness, each aspect invites us to reflect on our own practices.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Imagine if we could bring that same level of attention and presence into everything we do—whether it's working, eating, or spending time with loved ones.

>>Tea Master: Yes, exactly! And notice how gently whisking matcha creates a frothy surface that invites immersion in this moment. It's all about being fully engaged with what you're doing right now.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: From my research, I've found that many cultures have their own ways of fostering mindfulness through daily rituals. For example, some Native American tribes use storytelling as a way to stay connected and present. How do you see these different practices influencing one another? 
 >>Tea Master: So, let's talk about how different types of tea gatherings offer unique experiences. A chakai is simpler with light refreshments, while a chaji is more formal with a full-course meal followed by thick tea.

>>Cultural Historian: Right! Chakai is definitely more casual—great for newcomers. But chaji really dives deep into harmony, respect...all those core principles.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Absolutely. Both types help us connect with ourselves but in different ways. It's all about being present in each moment.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: And socially? Chakai lets people relax more easily; it's less rigid than chaji's hierarchical structure.

>>Cultural Historian: Oh yeah! And don't forget how seasonal changes affect everything—from procedures to utensils. Like using Neriko incense in winter versus Jin in summer—it's all about syncing with nature's cycles.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: As we brew tea, we're reminded that every moment is fleeting—a lesson in embracing change peacefully.

>>Tea Master: Exactly! Preparing tea can be like meditation—each gesture brings mindfulness into our daily lives.

>>Cultural Historian: Speaking of history—ever wonder why chaji includes a full-course meal? It goes back to samurai traditions as a sign of hospitality!

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: In stillness during these gatherings, we see reflections of our inner seasons—adapting externally helps us harmonize internally too. 
 >>Tea Master: As the Tea Master here, I'd like to start by showing you how the chadōgu, or tea utensils, enhance our experience. Each piece, from the chawan to the chasen, is chosen with care to reflect the season and occasion. Notice how these elements create a harmonious atmosphere that fosters creativity and mindfulness.

>>Cultural Historian: That's interesting! Can you tell us more about how these utensils are selected?

>>Tea Master: Certainly. For example, in spring, we might choose a lighter-colored chawan to reflect the freshness of the season. Each choice is deliberate and adds to the overall experience.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: I remember during one tea ceremony last spring; we used cherry blossoms which beautifully captured the essence of wabi-sabi by highlighting their fleeting beauty. It was a powerful reminder of our own journey towards mindfulness and inner peace.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: While I agree with the importance of aesthetics in reinforcing cultural values, I also think there's an evolving aspect as modern influences blend with traditional practices. Have you noticed any changes in recent years?

>>Tea Master: Absolutely. We've seen some contemporary designs being incorporated into traditional settings, which can be quite refreshing while still respecting tradition.

>>Cultural Historian: The historical context of chadōgu is fascinating too. Each utensil has evolved over centuries to embody principles like wabi-sabi—embracing simplicity and imperfection. These elements are meticulously chosen because they reflect a deeper cultural philosophy that values harmony and mindfulness.

>>Tea Master: Now observe how the chabana, or tea flowers, are arranged to reflect the season and occasion. Each flower is chosen with care to enhance the aesthetic experience and create a sense of harmony within the tea room.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: From my research, these aesthetic elements in Japanese tea ceremonies serve not only to enhance sensory experiences but also reinforce social bonds and cultural values. They reflect a deep respect for nature and tradition.

>>Cultural Historian: The chabana is not merely a floral arrangement but a reflection of nature's transient beauty and our connection to it. Such simplicity can evoke profound emotions because it reminds us of life's impermanence.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: The chabana mirrors our own journey towards inner peace. Each flower reminds us to embrace the present moment and find harmony within ourselves.

>>Tea Master: Now let's look at how calligraphy in the tokonoma complements our tea ceremony. Each scroll reflects the season or theme of our gathering, enhancing the atmosphere and guiding our thoughts towards mindfulness and harmony.

>>Cultural Historian: The calligraphy in the tokonoma is not just an aesthetic addition but a profound reflection of Zen principles. Each character embodies centuries of cultural evolution, guiding our thoughts towards mindfulness. 
 >>Tea Master: Now, observe how the structured practice of temae can be a powerful tool for innovation training. Each deliberate movement fosters mindfulness and encourages disciplined problem-solving.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Indeed, this mirrors Zen principles where each action cultivates presence. It's about embodying mindfulness in every step.

>>Cultural Historian: Building on that, Sen no Rikyū's refinement of the tea ceremony shows how structure can enhance creativity—each element meticulously designed to encourage both mindfulness and innovation.

>>Tea Master: Notice how each step—from folding the fukusa to whisking matcha—requires precision...

>>Cultural Anthropologist (interrupting): If I may add, this meticulous attention also strengthens social bonds through shared experiences that foster mutual respect.

>>Tea Master: Absolutely! These shared experiences are crucial for an innovative environment. Structured methods in tea preparation can similarly foster creativity in training programs.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Yes, it's not just about making tea but being fully present in every action—a lesson in mindfulness applicable beyond tea ceremonies.

>>Cultural Historian: And historically speaking, Sen no Rikyū’s approach highlights how detailed practices can nurture innovative thinking—a principle we see reflected in modern innovation strategies today. 
 >>Zen Buddhist Monk: Think about how we can apply mindfulness from Zen practices to our work. It's not just for the tea room; it can guide us in our creative processes too.

>>Tea Master: Good point. And what if we designed our offices with intentional gaps and pauses, like the concept of 'ma' in Japanese culture? It could give us moments to reflect and spark creativity.

>>Cultural Historian: Yes, 'ma' is fascinating. Japanese gardens use empty spaces to create balance and tranquility. We could use that idea to make our workspaces more calming.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's interesting! And what if we applied 'omotenashi,' or Japanese hospitality, to customer service? Treating every interaction with care could build stronger connections and loyalty.

>>Tea Master: I like that idea. Also, incorporating elements from traditional Japanese architecture into modern office design—like natural materials and open spaces—could make a big difference in creating a calming environment.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Imagine having elements like flowing water or natural stones in our workspaces. It would bring a sense of calm and focus, much like a Zen garden does.

>>Cultural Historian: And these principles can also help us solve problems differently. Embracing 'wabi-sabi,' which values imperfection, might lead us to more innovative solutions.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! In my research, I've seen how shared experiences during tea ceremonies foster social bonds and respect. We could translate this into team-building activities for better collaboration.

>>Tea Master: Let's get practical here. How about we start by including short breaks for reflection in our meeting schedules? It might lead to more productive discussions.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Yes, mindfulness isn't just about stillness but being fully present in each task. This presence can turn even mundane activities into opportunities for insight and innovation.

>>Cultural Historian: Exactly! Many great innovations have come from periods of contemplation rather than constant activity. We should encourage quiet reflection in our daily routines.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: I agree, but I'm curious—do you think incorporating traditional architecture will fit with our modern office needs?

>>Tea Master: That's a good question. Maybe we can find a balance by integrating some elements without completely overhauling the design. For example, using natural materials where possible.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: And let's not forget other cultures too. For instance, Scandinavian design also emphasizes simplicity and functionality which could complement these ideas well.

>>Cultural Historian: Great point! So let's try scheduling short breaks during our next meeting and see if it improves productivity. We can also explore integrating some natural elements into our workspace gradually. 
 >>Zen Buddhist Monk: Ah, you see, I recall a time when I was guiding a tea ceremony for a group of young students. As the tea brewed, their initial restlessness gradually transformed into calm focus. It was a beautiful reminder of how tradition can foster mindfulness and presence.

>>Tea Master: That's wonderful! You know, I once taught a group of business professionals who were skeptical at first. But as we moved through each step with deliberate care, they began to appreciate the tranquility and focus it brought them. It's great to see how traditions can bring people together.

>>Cultural Historian: Interestingly, I once visited a remote village in Japan where the local community had preserved an ancient form of tea ceremony. The villagers had adapted traditional practices to their daily lives, integrating modern elements while maintaining the essence of wabi-sabi. They even used locally grown herbs instead of traditional tea leaves.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That sounds amazing! It reminds me of my fieldwork in rural Japan where I observed similar adaptations in other cultural practices. It's incredible how these traditions evolve yet retain their core values.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Yes, it's fascinating. Another time comes to mind when I led a tea ceremony for international students. Their curiosity turned into genuine appreciation as they experienced the ritual's depth and beauty firsthand.

>>Tea Master: How did they react after the ceremony? I've noticed that people often have profound reflections after participating in such rituals.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: They were quite moved. Some mentioned feeling more connected to themselves and others around them. It was heartening to see such reactions.

>>Cultural Historian: Indeed! One must consider the broader context of how these traditions have evolved over time. Like that village I mentioned earlier—it's fascinating to see such balance between innovation and tradition.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! And it's not just about preserving old ways but also about finding new relevance in them today. I've seen this dynamic play out across various cultures during my research trips.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: While tradition is important, we also need to consider how these practices can be made more accessible to different audiences without losing their essence.

>>Tea Master: Agreed. There's an inherent beauty in these rituals that transcends time and culture. When we slow down and engage fully with each step, we find ourselves more connected—to both the past and present moments. 
 >>Zen Buddhist Monk: Ah, you see, while the ritual is indeed significant, it is essential to remember that the essence of the tea ceremony lies in its ability to bring us into a state of mindfulness and presence. We must ensure this deeper purpose isn't overshadowed by the form.

>>Cultural Historian: That's true. Historically, Sen no Rikyū emphasized wabi-sabi to counteract an overemphasis on form. How do we ensure modern practices don't lose this focus?

>>Tea Master: We could educate participants on both the ritual and its philosophy to help them appreciate both aspects equally.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Um, that's an interesting point. But don't you think modern adaptations might actually help keep these traditions alive? Like making them more accessible?

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Ah well, there's truth in that too. Adaptation can be a bridge between tradition and contemporary life. But how do we balance adaptation with preserving core values?

>>Cultural Historian: You know, historically speaking, every cultural practice evolves over time. The key is ensuring that these changes don't dilute the original intent but rather enhance it.

>>Tea Master: I agree with preserving core values through adaptation.

>>Cultural Historian: But isn't there a risk that too much adaptation could dilute the original intent?

>>Tea Master: Let's see... Perhaps it's about educating participants on both aspects—the ritual and its underlying philosophy—so they appreciate both equally.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Right! And maybe incorporating stories or anecdotes from history could help people connect more deeply with these practices.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Ah yes, storytelling has always been a powerful tool for conveying deeper meanings. It allows individuals to experience the essence beyond just observing rituals.

>>Cultural Historian: Absolutely! And by sharing these stories within their historical context, we can provide a richer understanding of why certain practices evolved as they did.

>>Tea Master: Well then, perhaps we should also consider how different audiences might perceive these ceremonies differently based on their backgrounds and experiences.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Exactly! It's fascinating how cultural contexts shape our interpretations and experiences of such rituals.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: So true. Each person brings their own perspective to the ceremony, which adds layers of meaning and connection. 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, from my research, the social dynamics within the tea ceremony highlight how roles of host and guest foster mutual respect. This respect is crucial as we move forward in fostering a culture of innovation.

>>Cultural Historian: That's a great point about respect, Anthropologist! Reflecting on the historical context of the tea ceremony, it's essential to remember how these practices have evolved to foster mindfulness and community. We could start by incorporating small mindful practices into our team meetings.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: I agree with you both. How about starting each meeting with a brief moment of mindfulness? It could help set a respectful tone and improve focus.

>>Tea Master: That sounds like a good idea. Notice how deliberate actions in the tea ceremony can guide us. Maybe we can create rituals that encourage intentionality in our work processes.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Exactly! And you know, modern adaptations can help keep traditions alive while still respecting their origins. We should look at ways to incorporate storytelling into this process too.

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: In our discussions, we've seen how mindfulness and respect can boost innovation. Let's think about simple ways to bring these ideas into our daily work.

>>Tea Master: Yes, deliberate actions are key. For example, we could start by being more intentional during our project kick-offs or even in everyday tasks.

>>Cultural Historian: By integrating these historical practices into modern contexts, we not only preserve tradition but also enrich our present-day interactions with deeper meaning. What if we also included some elements of traditional storytelling to share experiences and lessons learned?

>>Zen Buddhist Monk: Well... How can we incorporate these values into our daily routines? It's about finding balance between tradition and modernity to truly foster a culture of innovation.

>>Tea Master: Let's see... As we prepare for our next steps, ensuring that these values are integrated into our work processes will be key. The deliberate actions in the tea ceremony offer a perfect model for mindful and respectful interactions within teams."
