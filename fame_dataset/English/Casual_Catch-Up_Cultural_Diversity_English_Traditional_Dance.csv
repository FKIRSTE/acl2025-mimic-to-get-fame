Traditional Dance,"A folk dance is a dance that reflects the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example, ritual dances or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called ""religious dances"" because of their purpose.

The terms ""ethnic"" and ""traditional"" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as polka, cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between ""folk"" and ""ballroom dance"", ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.[1]

Folk dances share some or all of the following attributes:

More controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term ""folk dance"" is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms ""ethnic dance"" or ""traditional dance"" are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass ceremonial dances.

There are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term ""folk dance"" is generally not applied to them, and the terms ""street dance"" or ""vernacular dance"" are used instead. The term ""folk dance"" is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of ""common folk"" and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.

Varieties of European folk dances include:

Sword dances include long sword dances and rapper dancing. Some choreographed dances such as contra dance, Scottish highland dance, Scottish country dance, and modern western square dance, are called folk dances, though this is not true in the strictest sense. Country dance overlaps with contemporary folk dance and ballroom dance. Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.

People familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before. Some countries' dances have features that are unique to that country, although neighboring countries sometimes have similar features.  For example, the German and Austrian schuhplattling dance consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries' dances have.

Folk dances sometimes evolved long before current political boundaries, so that certain dances are shared by several countries.  For example, some Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian dances share the same or similar dances, and sometimes even use the same name and music for those dances.

International folk dance groups exist in cities and college campuses in many countries, in which dancers learn folk dances from many cultures for recreation.

Balfolk events are social dance events with live music in Western and Central Europe, originating in the folk revival of the 1970s and becoming more popular since about 2000, where popular European partner dances from the end of the 19th century such as the schottische, polka, mazurka and waltz are danced, with additionally other European folk dances, mainly from France, but also from Sweden, Spain and other countries.

It was clarified that not all ethnic dances are considered folk dances, with ritual or religious dances being notable exceptions. The terms 'ethnic' and 'traditional' were discussed as emphasizing cultural roots, with nearly all folk dances falling under these categories. However, some dances like polka cross ethnic boundaries and blur lines between folk and ballroom dance. Folk dancing was defined as having no governing body or competitive institutions, often originating before the 20th century in European culture. Modern spontaneous dances like hip hop are categorized separately as street or vernacular dance. European varieties such as sword dances, contra dance, Scottish highland dance, and modern western square dance were mentioned, noting overlaps with country and ballroom dance. Unique features of certain countries' dances were highlighted, such as the German and Austrian schuhplattling. It was noted that some folk dances predate current political boundaries, leading to shared traditions among neighboring countries like Serbia, Bulgaria, and Croatia. International folk dance groups on college campuses promote recreational learning of diverse cultural dances. Balfolk events in Western and Central Europe were also discussed for their role in reviving 19th-century partner dances alongside other European folk traditions.","[""Scene 1: Warm Welcome\nTLDR: Brief greeting and setting the tone for a casual catch-up.\n- Quick hellos and light banter\n- Mention of the meeting objectives: building rapport, sharing updates, discussing non-work topics\n- Encouragement for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Sharing Personal Updates\nTLDR: Participants share recent personal experiences or news.\n- Cultural Historian shares a recent trip or discovery related to traditional dances\n- Dance Choreographer talks about a new project or choreography they are working on\n- Ethnomusicologist discusses a recent fieldwork experience or musical discovery\n- Traditional Dance Performer shares a memorable performance or teaching moment"", ""Scene 3: Discussion on Traditional Dance Characteristics\nTLDR: Exploring the distinctions between traditional, folk, and ethnic dances.\n- Cultural Historian explains historical context and cultural roots of traditional dances\n- Dance Choreographer highlights practical aspects and differences in dance forms\n- Ethnomusicologist discusses the cultural significance of these dances in various communities"", ""Scene 4: Cross-Cultural Influences in Dance\nTLDR: Examining how certain dances cross ethnic boundaries and influence each other.\n- Examples like polka blurring lines between folk and ballroom dance\n- Discussion on shared traditions among neighboring countries (e.g., Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia)\n- Personal anecdotes from participants about witnessing or participating in such cross-cultural exchanges"", ""Scene 5: Modern vs. Traditional Dances\nTLDR: Comparing modern spontaneous dances with traditional folk dances.\n- Differences between street/vernacular dance (e.g., hip hop) and traditional folk dance forms\n- Participants share their views on how modern influences are shaping traditional dance practices"", ""Scene 6: Unique Features of European Folk Dances\nTLDR: Highlighting specific European folk dance varieties and their unique characteristics.\n- Discussion on sword dances, contra dance, Scottish highland dance, etc.\n- Insights into German/Austrian schuhplattling from participants\u2019 experiences or knowledge"", ""Scene 7: Revival of Folk Dances through Balfolk Events\nTLDR: Discussing the role of Balfolk events in reviving partner dances from the 19th century.\n- Ethnomusicologist shares insights into Balfolk events in Western/Central Europe\n- Participants discuss their thoughts on the revival of these traditions and its impact on contemporary culture"", ""Scene 8: Open Floor for Spontaneous Topics & Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allowing space for any unplanned discussions or light-hearted conversations.\n- Encouraging participants to bring up any interesting topics not covered yet \n - Sharing funny stories or memorable moments related to dancing \n - Light-hearted banter to keep the atmosphere relaxed"", ""Scene 9: Wrapping Up & Final Thoughts\nTLDR: Concluding the meeting with final reflections and takeaways.\n - Each participant shares one key takeaway from the discussion \n - Expressing appreciation for each other\u2019s contributions \n - Setting a positive tone for future catch-ups""]",">>Cultural Historian: Hello everyone! Great to see you all again.
>>Dance Choreographer: Hi! I've been busy with a new choreography inspired by traditional folk dances. How about you?
>>Ethnomusicologist: Hey folks! I've been doing some fieldwork on the cultural significance of music. What’s new with you guys?
>>Traditional Dance Performer: Hi everyone! I’ve been teaching traditional dances to new students. What have you all been up to?

>>Cultural Historian: Interestingly, I’ve been looking into how traditional dances have evolved over time. Have any of you noticed changes in your work?
>>Dance Choreographer: Definitely! I see traditional elements blending with modern styles in my choreography.
>>Ethnomusicologist: Same here—music adapts while keeping its roots intact.
>>Traditional Dance Performer: Yes, students often add their own twist to traditional moves.

>>Cultural Historian: That's exactly what makes this field so intriguing—how traditions evolve yet stay true to their origins. By the way, have any of you come across a dance or musical piece recently that particularly stood out for its historical significance?
>>Dance Choreographer: Actually, yes! There’s this old folk dance from Eastern Europe that's still performed today almost unchanged. It was like stepping back in time!
>>Cultural Historian: That’s fascinating about the Eastern European dance, can you tell us more about it?
>>Dance Choreographer: Sure! It’s almost unchanged for centuries and has such a rich history behind it...

>>Ethnomusicologist: That sounds amazing! I recently recorded some ancient songs from a remote village—they've been passed down orally for generations and still hold such deep meaning for the community.
>>Traditional Dance Performer: Wow, that's incredible! There's something so powerful about those connections to history through art.

>>Ethnomusicologist: While I agree that traditions adapt, I sometimes find that certain aspects are lost over time which can be concerning.
>>Dance Choreographer: True, but isn't it also exciting how new interpretations can breathe fresh life into these traditions? 
 >>Cultural Historian: You know, I recently got back from the Balkans. I saw these traditional dances that have been around for centuries. The footwork and costumes were incredible—like stepping into a living museum. It's amazing how these dances preserve history and identity.

>>Ethnomusicologist: That sounds fantastic! I was in Peru not too long ago, recording traditional music in a remote village. The melodies and rhythms were so intertwined with their daily lives—it felt like capturing the heartbeat of their community.

>>Dance Choreographer: Oh, that's really cool. I've been working on blending traditional Indian folk dance with contemporary elements in my new choreography. It's fascinating to see how the old and new can come together to create something fresh yet rooted in tradition.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Definitely! I recently taught a group of young students a traditional dance from my hometown. Their enthusiasm was infectious! They picked up the steps so quickly and even added their own flair.

>>Cultural Historian: That's great to hear! When I was in the Balkans, I noticed each village had its own twist on the same dance—almost like dialects of a language. It’s such a vivid reminder of how culture evolves while keeping its core essence.

>>Dance Choreographer: Wow, that's fascinating. Traditional dances really do teach us about the past. Each step feels like a page from history.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: For sure! And when teaching kids, they often add their own twists, almost creating a new version of an old story.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Yeah, exactly! In Peru, the traditional music is more than just entertainment; it's part of their rituals and daily life. Each song carries stories and traditions from their ancestors. 
 >>Cultural Historian: You know, the distinction between traditional, folk, and ethnic dances often lies in their historical context and cultural roots. For instance, while folk dances like the polka have crossed ethnic boundaries and evolved into ballroom styles, traditional dances remain deeply tied to specific cultural rituals and identities. These dances are not just performances but living embodiments of a community's heritage.

>>Dance Choreographer: Yeah, exactly! When we talk about traditional dances, we're looking at movements that are deeply rooted in cultural rituals and identities. Unlike folk dances that might evolve into ballroom styles, traditional dances often maintain their original form and purpose. Like the intricate footwork in Kathak or the storytelling aspect of Hula – these elements are preserved because they carry significant cultural meanings.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Absolutely! Traditional dances are like musical scores that tell the story of a community's heritage. They often carry deep cultural significance, serving as a living archive of rituals and traditions. In many African cultures, dance is intertwined with music to celebrate harvests or rites of passage.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Right! When teaching these traditional dances, I often see students bringing their own flair to the movements. It's fascinating how they respect the cultural roots while adding a bit of themselves into it. Have you noticed similar trends in other dance forms?

>>Cultural Historian: Interestingly enough, this reminds me of how folk dances have evolved over time with personal touches from dancers. Historically speaking, these personal touches can be seen as a continuation of the dance's living tradition. It's fascinating to see this blend of preservation and innovation in action.

>>Dance Choreographer: Totally! When students add their own flair to traditional dances, it's like they're creating a dialogue between the past and present. These personal touches breathe new life into age-old traditions while still respecting their roots. Have you seen this kind of evolution in other cultural practices?

>>Ethnomusicologist: To put it musically, traditional dances are like the heartbeat of a community. They carry stories, emotions, and histories passed down through generations. Certain rhythms or movements can evoke such strong cultural memories.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Exactly! It's wonderful to see how traditional dances can evolve while still preserving their essence. When I teach these dances, I emphasize understanding the cultural context behind each movement.

>>Cultural Historian: The way certain gestures or steps in traditional dances are tied to specific rituals or stories is quite profound. Historically speaking, these movements serve as non-verbal communication conveying messages and emotions that words alone cannot capture.

>>Dance Choreographer: So true! The practical application of traditional dances shows how these movements are preserved but also adapted in contemporary settings. Incorporating traditional elements into modern choreography creates a beautiful fusion that respects roots while appealing to today's audience.

>>Ethnomusicologist: From a cultural perspective, it's incredible how certain rhythms or movements can evoke strong memories tied to traditions passed down through generations. 
 >>Cultural Historian: You know, the polka is a great example of how dances can start in one place and end up all over the world. It began as a folk dance in Central Europe but eventually made its way into ballrooms everywhere. It's amazing how these dances change over time but still keep their roots.

>>Dance Choreographer: Yeah, the polka's journey is amazing! It shows how adaptable traditional dances can be. You know—

>>Ethnomusicologist: Absolutely! It's like watching a melody evolve... Have you guys seen other dances that have made similar transitions?

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Oh yeah! I've seen this firsthand with some dances from my region.

>>Cultural Historian: Really? Which ones?

>>Traditional Dance Performer: The Serbian kolo and Bulgarian horo come to mind... They share similar steps but have unique twists reflecting their cultural nuances. It's wonderful to see them blend and influence each other while maintaining distinct identities.

>>Cultural Historian: Fascinating! The Serbian kolo and Bulgarian horo indeed show how neighboring cultures can share yet uniquely interpret similar dance forms. Historically speaking, these dances often evolved in parallel due to shared experiences and geographical proximity. Have you noticed any specific elements that distinctly differentiate them despite their similarities?

>>Dance Choreographer: For sure! The kolo often has more circular formations, creating a sense of unity, while the horo can be more linear with intricate footwork highlighting individual skill. These subtle differences really change the overall feel of each dance.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Exactly! It's like each dance tells its own story through these variations. From my fieldwork, I've noticed that certain rhythms or steps are adapted differently depending on the region's musical traditions too.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Right! And those differences impact not just the dancers but also how audiences engage with the performance. Like when I perform or teach these dances, I see how people respond differently based on those subtle changes.

>>Cultural Historian: Indeed, it's like observing different dialects within the same language—each variation adds richness to our understanding of cultural expression through dance. 
 >>Dance Choreographer: You know, when we think about modern dances like hip hop, it's amazing how they evolve spontaneously and reflect current culture. But traditional folk dances have this deep-rooted connection to their origins. How do you see these modern influences blending with traditional forms?

>>Ethnomusicologist: That's a great point! I think it's crucial to maintain the core rhythm and essence of these stories while introducing modern elements. Maybe we could look at specific examples where this has been done successfully?

>>Cultural Historian: Indeed, many traditional dances have historically incorporated elements from other cultures or periods. It's important that any new influences enhance rather than overshadow our cultural heritage. What are some practical ways we can ensure this happens?

>>Traditional Dance Performer: I love seeing students add their own flair to traditional dances; it really brings them alive! But we need guidelines to respect cultural significance while allowing for creativity. Any thoughts on how we can set those guidelines?

>>Dance Choreographer: So true! Blending modern elements with traditional dances is like creating a fusion dish—you want new flavors without overpowering the original taste. Maybe workshops could help dancers understand this balance better?

>>Ethnomusicologist: Workshops sound like a fantastic idea! We could also document successful fusions as case studies for others to learn from.

>>Cultural Historian: Absolutely, and perhaps involving community elders in these workshops could provide valuable insights into maintaining authenticity while innovating.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Yes, involving community elders would be great! Also, maybe having regular feedback sessions with both young dancers and tradition bearers could help keep everyone aligned.

>>Dance Choreographer: That sounds perfect! Regular feedback sessions would definitely help in keeping the balance between innovation and tradition. 
 >>Cultural Historian: You know, the schuhplattling dance from Germany and Austria is fascinating because it's both unique and shared across regions. Historically, men performed it to impress women with their strength and agility through rhythmic slapping.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Absolutely! It reminds me how music and dance are intertwined in cultural storytelling—like a dialogue between dancer and audience. Have you seen similar elements in other European folk dances?

>>Dance Choreographer: Oh yeah! Speaking of storytelling through dance, have you ever seen the Basque sword dance? It's like watching a narrative unfold with each precise step.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Yeah! Each move tells a story—it's almost like live-action theater.

>>Cultural Historian: Exactly! It has roots in ancient warrior traditions where each step symbolized aspects of battle.

>>Ethnomusicologist: And it's not just about movements but also how music enhances these narratives—like Scottish highland dancing with bagpipes setting scenes for tales of bravery.

>>Dance Choreographer: Right! And contra dancing from New England emphasizes community interaction—each pattern represents social bonds within the group.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: I love contra dancing! It's so engaging because everyone participates together—it really brings people closer.

>>Cultural Historian: Indeed, contra dancing was historically a way for communities to bond during gatherings.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Speaking of community dances, have any of you tried Irish céilí dancing? The energy is incredible!

>>Dance Choreographer: Yes, I have! It's such a blast. The fast-paced steps and lively music really get everyone moving.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: I've always wanted to try that. It looks like so much fun! 
 >>Ethnomusicologist: You know, Balfolk events have this incredible way of connecting people through dance. It's like each step and twirl is a thread weaving together the past and present. Have you noticed how these events create a sense of community?

>>Cultural Historian: Absolutely! But do you think everyone feels that connection?

>>Dance Choreographer: Yeah, it's like a dance time machine! They mix old partner dances with modern moves. Have you seen how they incorporate contemporary steps while keeping the traditional essence?

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Totally! These events are great for keeping traditional dances alive. It's amazing to see people of all ages come together and really get into the rhythm. Have you noticed how they often add their own flair while still respecting the original steps?

>>Cultural Historian: In essence, these events connect us to the 19th century. Each dance step has historical significance.

>>Dance Choreographer: What's really fascinating is how these events encourage improvisation. Dancers can add their own flair while still respecting traditional steps.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Speaking of adding flair—did anyone catch that impromptu performance at last week's event? It was incredible!

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Yes! That was amazing! The way they seamlessly blended different styles was so inspiring.

>>Cultural Historian: To put it in perspective, these Balfolk events breathe new life into historical partner dances. They preserve traditional steps but also allow for contemporary interpretations, creating a dynamic and evolving art form.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Interestingly, these Balfolk events remind me of how music and dance are intertwined in cultural storytelling. Each dance step is like a note in a melody that tells our ancestors' story. Have you ever felt that connection when watching or participating in these dances? 
 >>Traditional Dance Performer: Oh, you know, there's this one time I was performing at a Balfolk event, and someone started an impromptu dance-off. It was hilarious! Everyone just jumped in with their own moves.

>>Dance Choreographer (laughing): No way—that sounds amazing! Once we switched from folk to breakdancing mid-performance—the audience went wild!

>>Ethnomusicologist (smiling): Wow, that's awesome! At a festival in Peru they performed the Marinera with handkerchiefs—so captivating!

>>Cultural Historian (nodding): That reminds me of Eastern European handkerchief dances—simple props conveying so much emotion.

>>Dance Choreographer: We used umbrellas once—it added such a whimsical touch!

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Umbrellas? Cool! Ever seen trained birds flying around on stage?

>>Ethnomusicologist: Incredible! In Mongolia they use horsehair fiddles during dances—such unique sound!

>>Cultural Historian: Instruments as props are powerful—in African tribal dances masks symbolize deities.

>>Dance Choreographer: I choreographed an underwater piece once—it was surreal!

>>Traditional Dance Performer: Underwater dancing? That's next level!

>>Ethnomusicologist (laughing): Creativity brings out amazing performances.

>>Cultural Historian (nodding): Absolutely! Combining traditional folk with modern street dance creates delightful fusions. 
 >>Traditional Dance Performer: You know, what really stood out to me is the joy and energy that traditional dances bring to both performers and audiences. It's amazing how these dances can evolve while still keeping their core spirit alive.

>>Dance Choreographer: Absolutely! I love how adaptable traditional dances are. We can blend old and new elements to create something fresh while still honoring the roots. Everyone's shared such great points!

>>Cultural Historian: The historical context embedded in each traditional dance is like a tapestry woven with threads of our ancestors' lives. These dances are not just performances but living archives of our ancestors' stories and rituals. It's fascinating how they continue to evolve.

>>Ethnomusicologist: Yeah, definitely! What I find interesting is the cultural significance embedded in traditional music. Each melody and rhythm tells a story of its own, reflecting the community's history and values. Thanks for sharing your thoughts; it's been really enlightening.

>>Traditional Dance Performer: And you know, it's been great hearing everyone's thoughts today. The way we all connect through these traditions is really special.

>>Cultural Historian: Absolutely! I've learned so much from everyone's insights today; they've enriched my understanding immensely."
