Computational Biology,"Computational biology refers to the use of techniques in computer science, data analysis, mathematical modeling and computational simulations to understand biological systems and relationships.[1] An intersection of computer science, biology, and data science, the field also has foundations in applied mathematics, molecular biology, cell biology, chemistry, and genetics.[2]

Bioinformatics, the analysis of informatics processes in biological systems, began in the early 1970s. At this time, research in artificial intelligence was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new algorithms. This use of biological data pushed biological researchers to use computers to evaluate and compare large data sets in their own field.[3]

By 1982, researchers shared information via punch cards. The amount of data grew exponentially by the end of the 1980s, requiring new computational methods for quickly interpreting relevant information.[3]

Perhaps the best-known example of computational biology, the Human Genome Project, officially began in 1990.[4] By 2003, the project had mapped around 85% of the human genome, satisfying its initial goals.[5] Work continued, however, and by 2021 level "" a complete genome"" was reached with only 0.3% remaining bases covered by potential issues.[6][7] The missing Y chromosome was added in January 2022.

Since the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of biology, leading to numerous subfields.[8] Today, the International Society for Computational Biology recognizes 21 different 'Communities of Special Interest', each representing a slice of the larger field.[9] In addition to helping sequence the human genome, computational biology has helped create accurate models of the human brain, map the 3D structure of genomes, and model biological systems.[3]

In 2000, despite a lack of initial expertise in programming and data management, Colombia began applying computational biology from an industrial perspective, focusing on plant diseases. This research has contributed to understanding how to counteract diseases in crops like potatoes and studying the genetic diversity of coffee plants.[10] By 2007, concerns about alternative energy sources and global climate change prompted biologists to collaborate with systems and computer engineers. Together, they developed a robust computational network and database to address these challenges. In 2009, in partnership with the University of Los Angeles, Colombia also created a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to improve the integration of computational biology and bioinformatics.[10]

In Poland, computational biology is closely linked to mathematics and computational science, serving as a foundation for bioinformatics and biological physics. The field is divided into two main areas: one focusing on physics and simulation and the other on biological sequences.[11] The application of statistical models in Poland has advanced techniques for studying proteins and RNA, contributing to global scientific progress. Polish scientists have also been instrumental in evaluating protein prediction methods, significantly enhancing the field of computational biology. Over time, they have expanded their research to cover topics such as protein-coding analysis and hybrid structures, further solidifying Poland's influence on the development of bioinformatics worldwide.[11]

Computational anatomy is the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or gross anatomical

 scale of morphology. It involves the development of computational mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulating biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of medical imaging and bioengineering for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morpheme scale in 3D.

The original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.[12] The diffeomorphism group is used to study different coordinate systems via coordinate transformations as generated via the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow from one anatomical configuration in

 to another. It relates with shape statistics and morphometrics, with the distinction that diffeomorphisms are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.

Mathematical biology is the use of mathematical models of living organisms to examine the systems that govern structure, development, and behavior in biological systems. This entails a more theoretical approach to problems, rather than its more empirically-minded counterpart of experimental biology.[13] Mathematical biology draws on discrete mathematics, topology (also useful for computational modeling), Bayesian statistics, linear algebra and Boolean algebra.[14]

These mathematical approaches have enabled the creation of databases and other methods for storing, retrieving, and analyzing biological data, a field known as bioinformatics. Usually, this process involves genetics and analyzing genes.

Gathering and analyzing large datasets have made room for growing research fields such as data mining,[14] and computational biomodeling, which refers to building computer models and visual simulations of biological systems. This allows researchers to predict how such systems will react to different environments, which is useful for determining if a system can ""maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations"".[15] While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy.[15] A useful modeling approach is to use Petri nets via tools such as esyN.[16]

Along similar lines, until recent decades theoretical ecology has largely dealt with analytic models that were detached from the statistical models used by empirical ecologists. However, computational methods have aided in developing ecological theory via simulation of ecological systems, in addition to increasing application of methods from computational statistics in ecological analyses.

Systems biology consists of computing the interactions between various biological systems ranging from the cellular level to entire populations with the goal of discovering emergent properties. This process usually involves networking cell signaling and metabolic pathways. Systems biology often uses computational techniques from biological modeling and graph theory to study these complex interactions at cellular levels.[14]

Computational biology has assisted evolutionary biology by:

Computational genomics is the study of the genomes of cells and organisms. The Human Genome Project is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient.[18]  This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual's pre-existing genetic patterns. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.[19]

One of the main ways that genomes are compared is by sequence homology. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.[19]

Sequence alignment is another process for comparing and detecting similarities between biological sequences or genes. Sequence alignment is useful in a number of bioinformatics applications, such as computing the longest common subsequence of two genes or comparing variants of certain diseases.[citation needed]

An untouched project in computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions, which comprise roughly 97% of the human genome.[19] Researchers are working to understand the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as ENCODE and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.

Understanding how individual genes contribute to the biology of an organism at the molecular, cellular, and organism levels is known as gene ontology. The Gene Ontology Consortium's mission is to develop an up-to-date, comprehensive, computational model of biological systems, from the molecular level to larger pathways, cellular, and organism-level systems. The Gene Ontology resource provides a computational representation of current scientific knowledge about the functions of genes (or, more properly, the protein and non-coding RNA molecules produced by genes) from many different organisms, from humans to bacteria.[20]

3D genomics is a subsection in computational biology that focuses on the organization and interaction of genes within a eukaryotic cell. One method used to gather 3D genomic data is through Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM). GAM measures 3D distances of chromatin and DNA in the genome by combining cryosectioning, the process of cutting a strip from the nucleus to examine the DNA, with laser microdissection. A nuclear profile is simply this strip or slice that is taken from the nucleus. Each nuclear profile contains genomic windows, which are certain sequences of nucleotides - the base unit of DNA. GAM captures a genome network of complex, multi enhancer chromatin contacts throughout a cell.[21]

Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the nervous system. A subset of neuroscience, it looks to model the brain to examine specific aspects of the neurological system.[22] Models of the brain include:

It is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the algorithms and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.

Computational neuropsychiatry is an emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. Several initiatives have demonstrated that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.[24][25][26]

Computational pharmacology is ""the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then screening drug data"".[27] The pharmaceutical industry requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.[28]

Analysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.[28]

Computational biology plays a crucial role in discovering signs of new, previously unknown living creatures and in cancer research. This field involves large-scale measurements of cellular processes, including RNA, DNA, and proteins, which pose significant computational challenges. To overcome these, biologists rely on computational tools to accurately measure and analyze biological data.[29] In cancer research, computational biology aids in the complex analysis of tumor samples, helping researchers develop new ways to characterize tumors and understand various cellular properties. The use of high-throughput measurements, involving millions of data points from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures, helps in diagnosing cancer at early stages and in understanding the key factors that contribute to cancer development. Areas of focus include analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer and understanding how the human genome relates to tumor causation.[29][30]

Computational toxicology is a multidisciplinary area of study, which is employed in the early stages of drug discovery and development to predict the safety and potential toxicity of drug candidates.

Computational biologists use a wide range of software and algorithms to carry out their research.

Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that finds patterns in unlabeled data. One example is k-means clustering, which aims to partition n data points into k clusters, in which each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Another version is the k-medoids algorithm, which, when selecting a cluster center or cluster centroid, will pick one of its data points in the set, and not just an average of the cluster.

The algorithm follows these steps:

One example of this in biology is used in the 3D mapping of a genome. Information of a mouse's HIST1 region of chromosome 13 is gathered from Gene Expression Omnibus.[31] This information contains data on which nuclear profiles show up in certain genomic regions. With this information, the Jaccard distance can be used to find a normalized distance between all the loci.

Graph analytics, or network analysis, is the study of graphs that represent connections between different objects. Graphs can represent all kinds of networks in biology such as protein-protein interaction networks, regulatory networks, Metabolic and biochemical networks and much more. There are many ways to analyze these networks. One of which is looking at centrality in graphs. Finding centrality in graphs assigns nodes rankings to their popularity or centrality in the graph. This can be useful in finding which nodes are most important. For example, given data on the activity of genes over a time period, degree centrality can be used to see what genes are most active throughout the network, or what genes interact with others the most throughout the network. This contributes to the understanding of the roles certain genes play in the network.

There are many ways to calculate centrality in graphs all of which can give different kinds of information on centrality. Finding centralities in biology can be applied in many different circumstances, some of which are gene regulatory, protein interaction and metabolic networks.[32]

Supervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns from labeled data and learns how to assign labels to future data that is unlabeled. In biology supervised learning can be helpful when we have data that we know how to categorize and we would like to categorize more data into those categories.

A common supervised learning algorithm is the random forest, which uses numerous decision trees to train a model to classify a dataset. Forming the basis of the random forest, a decision tree is a structure which aims to classify, or label, some set of data using certain known features of that data. A practical biological example of this would be taking an individual's genetic data and predicting whether or not that individual is predisposed to develop a certain disease or cancer. At each internal node the algorithm checks the dataset for exactly one feature, a specific gene in the previous example, and then branches left or right based on the result. Then at each leaf node, the decision tree assigns a class label to the dataset. So in practice, the algorithm walks a specific root-to-leaf path based on the input dataset through the decision tree, which results in the classification of that dataset. Commonly, decision trees have target variables that take on discrete values, like yes/no, in which case it is referred to as a classification tree, but if the target variable is continuous then it is called a regression tree. To construct a decision tree, it must first be trained using a training set to identify which features are the best predictors of the target variable.

Open source software provides a platform for computational biology where everyone can access and benefit from software developed in research. PLOS cites[citation needed] four main reasons for the use of open source software:

There are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, European Conference on Computational Biology and Research in Computational Molecular Biology.

There are also numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include Journal of Computational Biology and PLOS Computational Biology, a peer-reviewed open access journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences.[citation needed] Other journals relevant to this field include Bioinformatics, Computers in Biology and Medicine, BMC Bioinformatics, Nature Methods, Nature Communications, Scientific Reports, PLOS One, etc.

Computational biology, bioinformatics and mathematical biology are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and information science. The NIH describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.[1]

Specifically, the NIH defines

Computational biology: The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.[1]
Bioinformatics: Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data.[1]
While each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface,[1] so much so that to many, bioinformatics and computational biology are terms that are used interchangeably.

The terms computational biology and evolutionary computation have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as genetic algorithms, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.[34]

It's great to see such a diverse group here today. Let's dive into how we can use computational biology to advance personalized medicine. By leveraging computational techniques, we aim to create a robust framework for understanding complex biological systems.

>>Bioinformatician: Hey folks! I completely agree with the objectives laid out by [Computational Biologist]. Additionally, I think we should also consider how we can integrate these computational techniques with existing clinical workflows to ensure practical applicability.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Good morning, everyone! It's indeed a pleasure to be here. Today, our goal is to delve into the theoretical frameworks that can enhance our understanding of complex biological systems. By leveraging mathematical models, we aim to predict and simulate biological behaviors with greater accuracy.

>>Computational Biologist: Absolutely! And as we discuss these innovative approaches, let's keep in mind how they can directly impact patient care and treatment outcomes.

>>Bioinformatician: That's a great point, [Computational Biologist]. Speaking of patient care, I've been looking at some data-driven insights that could really streamline our processes and make them more efficient.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Exactly. Integrating real-world data will be crucial for validating our predictions and simulations. Maybe we can discuss specific datasets we've worked with?

>>Computational Biologist: Um, yes, that's a great point. We need both theoretical and practical perspectives working together seamlessly.

>>Bioinformatician: [Mathematical Biologist], I'd love to hear your thoughts on integrating computational techniques with mathematical models.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Let's see how we can combine our expertise effectively then. I'm particularly interested in how computational techniques can refine our mathematical models further. 
 >>Computational Biologist: You know, it's fascinating to see how the early use of network models in AI during the 1970s laid the groundwork for our current advancements. The Human Genome Project, which started in 1990 and gave us a near-complete genome by 2003, really changed everything. It opened up so many new avenues for research.

>>Bioinformatician: Absolutely! The Human Genome Project was a huge turning point. I mean, it wasn't just about mapping genes; it helped us understand how they interact and influence diseases. And those early AI models? They've evolved into the sophisticated algorithms we use today to analyze complex biological data.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Yeah, and speaking of those algorithms, have you seen the recent work on predicting protein structures? It's incredible how accurate these models have become. The theoretical frameworks from back then are still driving innovation today.

>>Computational Biologist: Definitely! And with personalized medicine, we're now able to tailor treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup. For instance, using genomic data to predict drug responses has been a game-changer in oncology.

>>Bioinformatician: That's true. Just last month, we used some of that genomic data to identify potential biomarkers for early cancer detection. It's amazing how far we've come since the days of just mapping out genes.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Can you explain a bit more about that biomarker discovery? How did you leverage the AI algorithms?

>>Bioinformatician: Sure! We used machine learning models trained on large datasets from various studies. These models can now predict with high accuracy which genetic variations are likely linked to specific types of cancer. It's like finding needles in a haystack but way faster and more precise.

>>Computational Biologist: That sounds impressive! And it's not just cancer—these advancements are helping with rare diseases too. We've identified several genetic mutations responsible for conditions that were previously misunderstood or misdiagnosed.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Exactly! And let's not forget about CRISPR technology—it’s another breakthrough that's benefited from all this genomic data. We're now editing genes with unprecedented precision thanks to these combined efforts.

>>Bioinformatician: Right, CRISPR is revolutionizing gene therapy and even agriculture. Remember when we discussed using it to create disease-resistant crops? That project is making great strides as well.

>>Computational Biologist: It's exciting times indeed! But there's still so much more to explore and understand. Every new discovery opens up ten more questions! 
 >>Bioinformatician: Have you seen the latest advancements in sequencing genomes? It's incredible how fast we can now sequence an entire genome. Can you believe it?

>>Mathematical Biologist: Yeah, it's remarkable. But the real challenge is using these sequences to model complex biological systems. For instance, in brain function modeling, understanding the genetic underpinnings allows us to create more accurate and predictive models of neural networks.

>>Computational Biologist: Exactly. When we talk about sequencing genomes and modeling brain functions, it's like having a detailed map of a city and then using that map to predict traffic patterns. The advancements in genome sequencing provide us with the 'map'—the genetic blueprint—while integrating this data into computational models allows us to simulate and understand complex neural networks.

>>Bioinformatician: Right! Integrating genomic data into brain function models helps us predict and understand complex behaviors more accurately.

>>Computational Biologist: Indeed, these advancements allow us to simulate neural network behaviors and understand the impact of genetic variations on brain function.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Imagine if we delve deeper into theoretical frameworks underpinning these models—we could start predicting not just neural network behaviors but also how specific genetic variations might influence cognitive functions and even mental health disorders.

>>Bioinformatician: Uh-huh! Integrating genomic data into brain function models is crucial for understanding neural pathways.

>>Computational Biologist: I agree, but we also need to consider how we validate these models with experimental data.

>>Mathematical Biologist: For instance, recent studies have shown how certain genetic mutations are linked to Alzheimer's disease, which we can now model more accurately thanks to these sequencing advancements.

>>Bioinformatician: And this means we can start predicting cognitive functions—

>>Computational Biologist (interrupting): Exactly! This integration is crucial for developing predictive models that help us understand brain behaviors more accurately. It’s like having a dynamic blueprint that evolves as we gather more data.

>>Mathematical Biologist: And if we consider the broader implications, this approach could revolutionize our understanding of mental health disorders by providing insights into their genetic basis.

>>Bioinformatician: Absolutely! It's like having a crystal ball for brain behavior! 
 >>Computational Biologist: So, let's consider the case of Colombia. Using computational biology, researchers have made significant strides in understanding plant diseases. For instance, they've used genetic data to identify disease-resistant varieties of crops like potatoes and coffee. This not only helps improve crop yields but also ensures sustainability in agriculture.

>>Mathematical Biologist: That's really interesting! Imagine applying mathematical models to predict the spread of plant diseases in Colombia. By simulating different environmental conditions, we can anticipate outbreaks and implement preventive measures more effectively. This approach helps us understand better and find practical solutions.

>>Bioinformatician: Speaking of advancements in other countries, let's look at Poland's contributions. Their focus on bioinformatics and biological physics is quite impressive. They've advanced techniques for studying proteins and RNA using statistical models, which has had a global impact.

>>Computational Biologist: Yeah, Poland's integration of bioinformatics with biological physics has led to some groundbreaking advancements. Researchers there have been able to study proteins and RNA at a much deeper level, leading to new treatments and enhancing our understanding of molecular biology.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Absolutely! And back to Colombia for a moment—by applying mathematical models to the genetic data from their crops, we can simulate various scenarios of disease spread. This allows us to predict potential outbreaks and devise strategies to mitigate them before they occur.

>>Bioinformatician: That's a great point! It's fascinating how much progress they've made with these approaches.

>>Computational Biologist: Exactly! In Colombia, computational biology has enabled researchers not only to identify disease-resistant crop varieties but also predict how these diseases might evolve under changing environmental conditions. This proactive approach is crucial for sustainable agriculture.

>>Mathematical Biologist: In my experience working with similar models, I've seen how effective this method can be in preventing large-scale agricultural losses.

>>Bioinformatician: I believe this method could be very effective because it combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications. 
 >>Computational Biologist: So, computational anatomy is fascinating because it allows us to model and simulate anatomical structures with incredible precision. By using dense 3D measurements from technologies like MRI, we can create detailed maps of the human body that are invaluable for both research and clinical applications. It's like having a highly detailed blueprint of the body's architecture.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Right, and these models aren't just static representations. We can dynamically manipulate them using mathematical transformations, such as diffeomorphisms, to study variations and deformations in biological forms. This provides a robust framework for understanding complex anatomical changes over time.

>>Bioinformatician: Sure, but we need to be cautious about data quality and consistency. Dense 3D measurements are great, but if the data isn't standardized or has inconsistencies, it could lead to inaccurate models.

>>Computational Biologist: Absolutely! To tackle data quality issues, we need solid validation protocols—like cross-validation techniques—to make sure our measurements are spot on.

>>Mathematical Biologist: And beyond that, we should consider how different calibration standards across MRI machines might introduce biases. If there's variability in how measurements are taken across different sites, it could skew our models significantly.

>>Bioinformatician: Exactly! Even with robust validation protocols in place, potential biases in the data collection process itself can't be ignored. Standardization across all stages is crucial to ensure accuracy and reliability.

>>Computational Biologist: For instance, we've seen how using standardized MRI data helped improve our heart disease models significantly. Consistent calibration really makes a difference.

>>Bioinformatician: And even with standardization, we can't overlook the sheer volume of data we're dealing with here. Processing and analyzing such massive datasets requires significant computational power and efficient algorithms.

>>Computational Biologist: Addressing computational challenges is indeed crucial. We need high-performance computing and efficient algorithms to handle the massive datasets involved in computational anatomy. Without robust computational infrastructure, even standardized data won't yield accurate models.

>>Mathematical Biologist: Imagine this—the application of diffeomorphisms in computational anatomy allows us to map and analyze anatomical changes with high precision dynamically. This approach helps understand structural variations while predicting potential deformations over time.

>>Bioinformatician: But even with scalable solutions for handling large datasets efficiently, we can't ignore potential data integrity issues either—noisy or incomplete data could compromise our entire model if not managed properly.

>>Computational Biologist: True enough! Ensuring our computational methods are resilient against noisy or incomplete data is vital too; adaptability will help maintain model integrity despite any imperfections within raw inputs themselves! 
 >>Mathematical Biologist: The main point is that mathematical models really help us understand biological systems better by predicting behaviors and interactions. For example, in drug discovery, these models let us simulate how different compounds interact with target proteins, which can save a lot of time and money on experimental trials.

>>Bioinformatician: Absolutely, and with large datasets, we can identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. When it comes to cancer research, analyzing these massive datasets helps us pinpoint genetic mutations more precisely.
