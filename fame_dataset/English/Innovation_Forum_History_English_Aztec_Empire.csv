Aztec Empire,"The Aztec Empire, also known as the Triple Alliance (Classical Nahuatl: Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, [ˈjéːʃkaːn̥ t͡ɬaʔtoːˈlóːjaːn̥]) or the Tenochca Empire, was an alliance of three Nahua city-states: Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan. These three city-states ruled that area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native allies who ruled under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521. Its people and civil society are historiographically referred to as the Aztecs or the Culhua-Mexica.
The alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of Azcapotzalco and its former tributary provinces. Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, the capital Tenochtitlan became dominant militarily. By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the alliance were effectively ruled from Tenochtitlan, while other partners of the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.
The alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded after its formation. The alliance controlled most of central Mexico at its height, as well as some more distant territories within Mesoamerica, such as the Xoconochco province, an Aztec exclave near the present-day Guatemalan border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as hegemonic or indirect. The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual tribute to the alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.
Aztec religion was a monistic pantheism in which the Nahua concept of teotl was construed as the supreme god Ometeotl, as well as a diverse pantheon of lesser gods and manifestations of nature. The popular religion tended to embrace the mythological and polytheistic aspects, and the empire's state religion sponsored both the monism of the upper classes and the popular heterodoxies. The empire even officially recognized the largest cults such that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital Tenochtitlan. The imperial cult was specifically that of the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica Huītzilōpōchtli. Peoples were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions in conquered provinces so long as they added the imperial god Huītzilōpōchtli to their local pantheons.


Etymology and definitions

The word Aztec  in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Aztecs or Triple Alliance, the Nahuatl-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the Mexica ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking tribes (from tlaca). The name comes from the singular Nahuatl word aztecatl (Nahuatl pronunciation: [asˈtekat͡ɬ]) that means ""[people] from Aztlan"", reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.


History


Before the Aztec Empire
Nahua peoples descended from Chichimec peoples, who migrated to central Mexico from the north (mainly centered sparsely around present-day states of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, and Guanajuato) in the early 13th century. The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history, as they sought political legitimacy. Pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history say that the empire's place of origin was called Aztlán. Early migrants settled the Basin of Mexico and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early Nahua city-states or altepetl were ruled by dynastic heads called tlahtohqueh (singularly tlatoāni). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.
These early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other but no individual city gained dominance due to shifting alliances. The Mexica were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250, and, by then, most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed. The Mexica persuaded the king of Culhuacan, a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the Toltecs to make them settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called Chapultepec (Chapoltepēc, ""in the hill of grasshoppers""). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.
After the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. Mythological native accounts say that the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin on the command of their god Xipe Totec. The ruler of Culhuacan attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force when he learned of this.  The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco where an eagle nested on a nopal cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their gods and founded their new city Tenochtitlan on this island in the year ōme calli (or ""Two House"", 1325 AD).


Aztec warfare

The Mexica rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power. The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power in the region.
The new Mexica city-state allied with the city of Azcapotzalco and paid tribute to its ruler Tezozomoc. Azcapotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire with Mexica assistance. The Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king until this point. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son Acamapichtli was enthroned as the first tlatoani of Tenochtitlan in 1372.
The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, while the Acolhua city of Texcoco grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.
Mexica warfare was marked by a focus on capturing enemies rather than killing them from its tactics to arms.  Capturing enemies was important for religious ritual and provided a means by which soldiers could distinguish themselves during campaigns.


Tepanec War
In 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died, and the resulting succession crisis precipitated a civil war between potential successors. The Mexica supported Tezozomoc's preferred heir Tayahauh, who was initially enthroned as king. But his son Maxtla soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler Chimalpopoca. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.
The new Mexica ruler Itzcoatl continued to defy Maxtla, and he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments. Maxtla similarly turned against the Acolhua, and the king of Texcoco Nezahualcoyotl fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city called Tlacopan. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.
After the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and, in 1430, the three remaining cities formed a treaty now known as the Triple Alliance. The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. A tribute was divided so that two kings of the alliance would go to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco and one would go to Tlacopan. The three kings assumed the title ""huetlatoani"" (""Elder Speaker"", often translated as ""Emperor"") in turn. Each temporarily held a de jure position above the rulers of other city-states (""tlatoani"") in this role.
In the following one hundred years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan dominated the Valley of Mexico and extended its power to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers and nephews of Itzcoatl Tlacaelel and Moctezuma. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica huetlatoani in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created ""Cihuacoatl"" title, equivalent to something between ""Prime Minister"" and ""Viceroy"".


Imperial reforms

Shortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and religion. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was ""not wise that all the people should know the paintings"". He rewrote the history of the Aztecs thereafter, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role.
After Moctezuma I succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities. Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals. This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by calpixqueh or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.
Moctezuma issued new laws that separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses. A religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood by royal decree. Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a ""telpochcalli"" where they received basic religious instruction and military training. A second, more prestigious type of school called a ""calmecac"" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called ""quauhpilli"" that could be conferred on commoners. This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English knight). Commoners who received this title rarely married into royal families and became kings.
One component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the Flower Wars. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for sacrifice to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice. Native historical accounts say that these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454. The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy Tlaxcala.


Early years of expansion

After the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of Morelos. These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.
Itzcoatl died, and Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided. Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into Oaxaca. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son Axayacatl. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.
Also, as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the Purépecha Empire in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Purépecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl. In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Purépecha's attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Purépecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers. Purépecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Purépecha in battle again.
In 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died, and his son Nezahualpilli was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco. This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481. Axayacatl was replaced by his brother Tizoc. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule, apparently due to his incompetence.


Later years of expansion

Tizoc was succeeded by his brother Ahuitzotl in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule. Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the Oaxaca Valley and the Soconusco Coast. Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost due to increased border skirmishes with the Purépecha. The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process. The Purépecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion. Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of Guerrero.
By the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title ""huehuetlatoani"" (""Eldest Speaker"") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan. The alliance still technically ran the empire. But the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.
Ahuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew Moctezuma II in 1502. Moctezuma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors. In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Purépecha Empire once again. The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding. The Purépecha defeated them and the army withdrew.
Moctezuma II instituted more imperial reforms. The death of Nezahualcoyotl caused the Mexica Emperors to become the de facto rulers of the alliance. Moctezuma II used his reign to attempt to consolidate power more closely with the Mexica Emperor. He removed many of Ahuitzotl's advisors and had several of them executed. He also abolished the quauhpilli class, destroying the chance for commoners to advance to the nobility. His reform efforts were cut short by the Spanish conquest in 1519.


Spanish conquest

The Spanish expedition leader Hernán Cortés landed in Yucatán in 1519 with approximately 630 men (most armed with only a sword and shield). Cortés had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba Diego Velásquez but had stolen the boats and left without permission. At the island of Cozumel, Cortés encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named Gerónimo de Aguilar who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where, after a brief battle with the local army, Cortés was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cortés a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named La Malinche (she was known also as Malinalli [maliˈnalːi], Malintzin [maˈlintsin] or Doña Marina [ˈdoɲa maˈɾina]). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan, and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Malinche became Cortés' translator for both language and culture once she learned Spanish, and she was a key figure in interactions with Nahua rulers.
Cortés then sailed from Campeche to Cempoala, a tributary province of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Nearby, he founded the town of Veracruz where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor Moctezuma II. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cortés went to Cempoala to meet with the local Totonac leaders. The Totonac ruler told Cortés of his various grievances against the Mexica, and Cortés convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector. Cortés subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it. The Totonacs provided Cortés with 20 companies of soldiers for his march to Tlaxcala, having effectively declared war on the Aztecs. At this time, several of Cortés' soldiers attempted to mutiny. When Cortés discovered the plot, he had his ships scuttled and sank them in the harbor to remove any possibility of escaping to Cuba.

The Spanish-led Totonac army crossed into Tlaxcala to seek the latter's alliance against the Aztecs. However, the Tlaxcalan general Xicotencatl the Younger believed them to be hostile and attacked. After fighting several close battles, Cortés eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cortés then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs in addition to the Spanish soldiers. During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cortés claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish. In a pre-emptive response, Cortés directed his troops to attack and kill a large amount of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.
Following the massacre at Cholula, Cortés and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl. After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca. Cortés claims that he used this incident as an excuse to take Motecuzoma prisoner under threat of force. Motecuzoma continued to run the kingdom as a prisoner of Cortés for several months. A second, larger Spanish expedition then arrived in 1520 under the command of Pánfilo de Narváez sent by Diego Velásquez with the goal of arresting Cortés for treason. Before confronting Narváez, Cortés secretly persuaded Narváez's lieutenants to betray him and join Cortés.
Cortés was away from Tenochtitlan dealing with Narváez, while his second-in-command Pedro de Alvarado massacred a group of Aztec nobility, in response to a ritual of human sacrifice honoring Huitzilopochtli. The Aztecs retaliated by attacking the palace where the Spanish were quartered. Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan and fought his way to the palace. He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down. However, by this point, the ruling council of Tenochtitlan had voted to depose Motecuzoma and had elected his brother Cuitlahuac as the new emperor. One of the Aztec soldiers struck Motecuzoma in the head with a sling stone, and he died several days later, though the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.

The Spaniards and their allies attempted to retreat without detection in what is known as the ""Sad Night"" or La Noche Triste, realizing that they were vulnerable to the hostile Mexica in Tenochtitlan following Moctezuma's death. Spaniards and their Indigenous allies were discovered clandestinely retreating and were then forced to fight their way out of the city with heavy loss of life. Some Spaniards lost their lives by drowning, loaded down with gold. They retreated to Tlacopan (now Tacuba) and made their way to Tlaxcala where they recovered and prepared for the second, successful assault on Tenochtitlan. After this incident, a smallpox outbreak hit Tenochtitlan. The outbreak alone killed more than 50% of the region's population, including the emperor Cuitláhuac, as the indigenous of the New World had no previous exposure to smallpox. The new emperor Cuauhtémoc dealt with the smallpox outbreak, while Cortés raised an army of Tlaxcalans, Texcocans, Totonacs, and others discontent with Aztec rule. Cortés marched back to the Basin of Mexico with a combined army of up to 100,000 warriors. The overwhelming majority of warriors were indigenous rather than Spanish. Cortés captured various indigenous city-states or altepetl around the lake shore and surrounding mountains through numerous subsequent battles and skirmishes, including the other capitals of the Triple Alliance, Tlacopan and Texcoco. Texcoco, in fact, had already become firm allies of the Spaniards and the city-state and subsequently petitioned the Spanish crown for recognition of their services in the conquest similar to Tlaxcala.
Cortés used boats constructed in Texcoco from parts salvaged from the scuttled ships to blockade and lay siege to Tenochtitlan for a period of several months. Eventually, the Spanish-led army assaulted the city both by boat and using the elevated causeways connecting it to the mainland. The attackers took heavy casualties, although the Aztecs were ultimately defeated. The city of Tenochtitlan was thoroughly destroyed in the process. Cuauhtémoc was captured as he attempted to flee the city. Cortés kept him prisoner and tortured him for a period of several years before finally executing him in 1525.


Government

The Aztec Empire was an example of an empire that ruled by indirect means. It was ethnically very diverse like most European empires but was more a system of tributes than a single unitary form of government unlike them. In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian Alexander J. Motyl, the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces. It merely expected to pay tributes. The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. land did not connect all of its dominated territories. For example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once they conquered their city-state, and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.
The form of government is often referred to as an empire, yet most areas within the empire were, in fact, organized as city-states (individually known as altepetl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or tlatoani (literally ""speaker"", plurally tlatoque) from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. After the Nahuas formed the empire in 1428 and the empire began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.
The term ""Aztec empire"" is actually modern and not one used by the Aztecs themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three Nahuatl-speaking city-states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states Tenochtitlan above the other two over time.  The ""Triple Alliance"" came to establish hegemony over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. The Nahuas performed administration of the empire through largely traditional, indirect means. Something of a nascent bureaucracy, however, may have been beginning to form over time, insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.


Central administration

Before the reign of Nezahualcoyotl (1429–1472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional Mesoamerican lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., ""speakers""), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a Huey Tlatoani (lit., ""great speaker"") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with calpixque stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.
Yet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the external issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the Cihuacoatl to govern a given city itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; Tlacaelel, for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title ""Cihuacoatl"", which means ""female snake"" (it is the name of a Nahua deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European Viceroy or Prime Minister, reflect the dualistic nature of Nahua cosmology. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the ""female"" wet season, those of the latter with the ""male"" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of Azcapotzalco, Culhuacan, and Tenochtitlan's ally Texcoco. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.
Early in the history of the empire, Tenochtitlan developed a four-member military and advisory Council which assisted the Huey tlatoani in his decision-making: the tlacochcalcatl; the tlaccatecatl; the ezhuahuacatl; and the tlillancalqui. This design not only provided advice for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth Huey Tlatoani could only be selected from the council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the cuauhchique (""shorn ones"") and the otontin (""Otomies""). The tetecuhtin, the relatives of the former Huey tlatoani, will choose the next Huey tlatoani from the four council members.


Provincial administration
Traditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials. The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular calpixqui, plural calpixque) were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into strategic tributary provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or huecalpixque, whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the huetlatoani, but rather by a separate position altogether: the petlacalcatl. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, the Nahuas placed a military governor, or cuauhtlatoani, at the head of provincial supervision. During his reign, Moctezuma I elaborated the calpixque system, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. The province itself stationed one, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Commoners drew the tribute, the macehualtin, and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (tlatoque), lesser rulers (teteuctin), or provincial nobility (pipiltin).
The Nahuas supervised the tribute collection by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the pipiltin (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as pochteca. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The pochteca strongly tied their power, political and economic, to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (teucnenenque, or ""travelers of the lord"") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous corporate groups, having administrative duties within their own estate.


Ideology and state

Nahua metaphysics centers around teotl, ""a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy or force."" This is conceptualized in a kind of monistic pantheism as manifest in the supreme god Ometeotl, as well as a large pantheon of lesser gods and idealizations of natural phenomena such as stars and fire. Priests and educated upper classes held more monistic views, while the popular religion of the uneducated tended to embrace the polytheistic and mythological aspects.
The Aztec empire's state-sanctioned religion meanwhile had to fulfill the spiritual obligations of the upper classes while maintaining their control over the lower classes and conquered populations. This was executed in grand public religious ceremonies, sponsorship of the most popular cults, and a relative degree of religious freedom.
Rulers, if they are local teteuctin or tlatoani, or central Huetlatoani, were seen as representatives of the gods and therefore ruled by divine right. Tlatocayotl, or the principle of rulership, established that descent inherited this divine right. Political order was, therefore, also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For this reason, whenever the Nahuas killed or otherwise removed a tlatoani from their station, their stead typically placed a relative and member of the same bloodline. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, hueitlatocayotl, standing in superior contrast to the lesser tlatocayotl principle.
A militaristic interpretation of Nahua religion, specifically a devout veneration of the sun god, Huitzilopochtli, guided expansion of the empire. Militaristic state rituals were performed throughout the year according to a ceremonial calendar of events, rites, and mock battles. The time period they lived in was understood as the Ollintonatiuh, or Sun of Movement, which was believed to have been the final age after which humanity would be destroyed. It was under Tlacaelel that Huitzilopochtli assumed his elevated role in the state pantheon and who argued that it was through blood sacrifice that the Sun would be maintained and thereby stave off the end of the world. It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of human sacrifice under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.


Schematic of hierarchy


Provincial structure

Originally, the Aztec empire was a loose alliance between three cities: Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and the most junior partner, Tlacopan. As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, Tenochtitlan assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, Tenochtitlan became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.
Though the Aztecs did not describe them this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate client states which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under ""mutual consent."" Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.

Mythological sacred places
Tamoanchan, a place where Itzpapalotl usually rules over. The gods created the first of the present human race out of sacrificed blood and ground human bones. Tamoanchan may mean ""We go down to our home.""
Mictlan, the place where Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacihuatl rule in Aztec mythology. This is literally the underworld.
Tlalocan, the place where Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue rule in Aztec mythology. One of several locations humans may go in the afterlife.


Law
Ruler Nezahualcoyotl developed the most developed code of law in the city-state of Texcoco under him. It was a formal written code, not merely a collection of customary practices. The sources for knowing about the legal code are colonial-era writings by Franciscan Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, Franciscan Fray Juan de Torquemada, and Texcocan historians Juan Bautista Pomar, and Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl. The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, as many tried cases by particular types of evidence and many disregarded the social status of the litigants, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.
Much less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period. Those under the reign of Moctezuma I established it. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. State authorities meted out punishments solely. The Nahuas enshrined Nahua mores in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, pochteca could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, military courts dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an appeal process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a supreme court and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the Huey tlatoani, who had the right to appoint lesser judges.

focused on the history and structure of the Aztec Empire, also known as the Triple Alliance. The alliance consisted of three Nahua city-states: Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan, which ruled central Mexico from 1428 until their defeat by Spanish conquistadores in 1521. Initially formed from victorious factions of a civil war, Tenochtitlan became dominant militarily. The empire expanded through wars of conquest, controlling most of central Mexico and some distant territories. Aztec rule was hegemonic; conquered cities retained local rulers who paid tribute and supplied military forces. The empire's religion combined monistic pantheism with popular polytheistic aspects, recognizing various cults and deities like Huitzilopochtli. Significant reforms were implemented to maintain control over conquered cities, including replacing uncooperative kings with loyal puppet rulers and establishing a new imperial tribute system. The Spanish conquest led by Hernán Cortés ultimately resulted in the fall of the Aztec Empire after a series of battles and alliances with indigenous groups.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the forum\n- Brief greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Encouragement for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Innovation\nTLDR: Discussing historical examples of innovation within the Aztec Empire\n- Historian shares insights on Aztec military strategies and political reforms\n- Anthropologist adds cultural context to these innovations\n- Open floor for spontaneous discussion"", ""Scene 3: Cultural Impact on Innovation\nTLDR: Exploring how culture influences innovative thinking\n- Anthropologist discusses societal structures and their role in fostering innovation\n- Sociologist provides analysis on social dynamics within the Aztec Empire\n- Participants share personal experiences related to cultural impact on innovation"", ""Scene 4: Material Evidence of Innovation\nTLDR: Examining archaeological findings that showcase Aztec ingenuity\n- Archaeologist presents key artifacts and architectural feats from the Aztec Empire\n- Linguist discusses linguistic evolution as a form of innovation\n- Open floor for questions and interactive discussion"", ""Scene 5: Spiritual Beliefs Driving Innovation\nTLDR: Understanding how religion influenced Aztec innovations\n- Religious Studies Scholar explains spiritual practices and their impact on societal advancements\n- Participants discuss parallels in modern-day spiritual beliefs driving innovation"", ""Scene 6: Identifying New Opportunities Through Historical Insights\nTLDR: Leveraging historical knowledge to identify new opportunities today\n- Historian highlights lessons learned from Aztec conquests and governance reforms \n - Sociologist connects these lessons to contemporary social structures \n - Open floor for brainstorming new ideas inspired by historical insights"", ""Scene 7: Enhancing Culture of Innovation Today \n TLDR : Strategies to foster a culture of innovation in modern contexts \n - Participants share successful strategies from their own fields \n - Collaborative discussion on implementing these strategies across different sectors \n - Brief off-topic moments to allow natural flow"", ""Scene 8 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarizing key points discussed & outlining future actions \n - Recap of generated ideas & identified opportunities \n - Discussion on maintaining momentum & fostering ongoing collaboration \n - Final thoughts & expressions of gratitude""]",">>Archaeologist: Morning, everyone! Let's jump right into the fascinating world of Aztec artifacts. These items really help us understand their daily lives and how they organized their society.

>>Anthropologist: Hi all! I'm eager to explore the cultural context today. It's amazing how much we can learn about the Aztecs' beliefs and everyday life through what they've left behind.

>>Historian: Good morning. The Aztec Empire's history is quite intriguing, especially the alliance between Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. This coalition was a powerhouse in central Mexico due to its strategic military alliances.

>>Sociologist: Sorry to cut in—could you explain how these alliances affected social interactions within the empire?

>>Historian: Sure thing! The Triple Alliance allowed local leaders some autonomy while requiring tribute payments. This system encouraged cooperation but also maintained control, influencing social dynamics across different regions.

>>Linguist: Hey folks! As we discuss the Aztecs, I'm curious about Nahuatl's evolution alongside their societal changes. Language isn't just communication; it's a reflection of culture. How has Nahuatl shaped our understanding of them?

>>Religious Studies Scholar: Good morning! When examining the Aztecs, it's essential to consider how their spiritual beliefs were woven into societal structures. Their pantheon and rituals played a crucial role in daily life and governance.

>>Historian: From an academic standpoint, the way the Aztec Empire managed such vast territories through indirect rule is impressive. They integrated various cultures while ensuring tribute flowed back to Tenochtitlan—creating complex political relationships.

>>Anthropologist: It's interesting how religion influenced daily life and societal organization. What does this tell us about their society?

>>Linguist: Speaking of language—Nahuatl adapted elements from conquered regions as the empire expanded—a dynamic interplay that influenced societal cohesion.

>>Religious Studies Scholar: Indeed, rituals were deeply intertwined with governance—showing religion as a guiding force in shaping worldview. 
 >>Historian: The Aztec Empire's military strategies were quite innovative. Their focus on capturing enemies rather than killing them served both tactical and religious purposes, ensuring a steady supply of captives for sacrifices. This method of warfare significantly influenced their political and social structures.
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely, the Aztec approach to warfare was deeply intertwined with their religious beliefs. Capturing enemies for sacrifices wasn't just a military strategy; it was a way to honor their gods and maintain cosmic balance. It really shows how religion shaped their society.
>>Religious Studies Scholar: Right, capturing enemies for sacrifices reflects the Aztec belief in maintaining cosmic balance through offerings to their gods, especially Huitzilopochtli. They saw it as essential to keep the universe going.
>>Archaeologist: And if we look at the material evidence, like obsidian blades and atlatls, we can see how these tools were designed for capturing rather than killing. These artifacts tell us a lot about their innovative strategies and how deeply embedded these practices were in their culture.
>>Sociologist: The practice of capturing enemies had profound implications for Aztec social structures. It reinforced hierarchical roles and ensured a continuous supply of captives for religious rituals, which helped maintain social cohesion.
>>Linguist: Building on what we've discussed about social structures, it's fascinating how Nahuatl evolved during this period to reflect complex political hierarchies with terms like 'tlatoani' and 'huey tlatoani.' This linguistic adaptation gives us insight into their societal organization.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, the creation of the 'Flower Wars' under Tlacaelel was a strategic move to ensure a steady supply of captives for religious sacrifices while also maintaining military prowess. This institutionalized form of warfare not only reinforced their religious practices but also solidified their dominance in the region.
>>Anthropologist: From an indigenous perspective, the Flower Wars were not just about capturing enemies for sacrifices but also a way to demonstrate military prowess and maintain social order. These wars reinforced societal hierarchy and gave warriors opportunities to prove their valor.
>>Religious Studies Scholar: Exactly! The Flower Wars weren't merely political maneuvers but profound expressions of the Aztec belief in cosmic balance. By capturing enemies for sacrifice they sought to appease their gods and ensure continuation of the universe.
>>Archaeologist: And from an artifact's perspective, these wars reveal how material culture reflects societal values. The obsidian blades used were designed specifically for capturing rather than killing—emphasizing live captives' importance in religious practices.
>>Sociologist: Focusing on capturing rather than killing definitely reinforced social hierarchies within Aztec society—ensuring that there was always a supply of captives maintained societal cohesion through those rituals. 
 >>Anthropologist: The Aztecs captured enemies instead of killing them because it was part of their religion. It ensured a continuous cycle of rituals that reinforced social cohesion.
>>Historian: Right, and this strategy also helped them get captives for sacrifices, which reinforced their social structure and maintained cosmic balance. But do we have enough evidence to support this theory?
>>Archaeologist: Absolutely, there's material evidence like obsidian blades designed for incapacitation rather than killing. These artifacts show how the practice fulfilled religious needs while ensuring a steady supply of captives.
>>Linguist: Interesting point! This practice also influenced the evolution of Nahuatl. They needed a rich vocabulary to describe various states of captivity and ritual sacrifice, which shaped their language significantly.
>>Religious Studies Scholar: And spiritually, it reflects their belief in maintaining cosmic balance through ritual sacrifice. This wasn't just about hierarchy; it was about fulfilling spiritual obligations to keep society thriving under divine favor.
>>Sociologist: Sociologically—
>>Anthropologist (interrupting): Actually, I think it's important to consider the indigenous perspective here too—
>>Sociologist: Sure, go ahead!
>>Anthropologist: Thanks! The Aztec practice fostered innovation within their societal structures by integrating captives into their society. This led to new ideas and cultural exchanges. What does this tell us about how diverse perspectives can drive innovation?
>>Linguist: From a language standpoint, integrating captives likely enriched Nahuatl with new linguistic elements, facilitating cultural exchanges and innovative thinking. How has this language shaped our understanding of societal adaptation? 
 >>Archaeologist: You know, the Aztec's use of chinampas is a prime example of their agricultural ingenuity. These artificial islands allowed them to cultivate crops year-round and sustain Tenochtitlan's large population.

>>Historian: Absolutely! And it's amazing how they managed such sophisticated agriculture on limited land. What can we learn from this about their societal organization?

>>Anthropologist: It really shows how deeply they understood environmental harmony and resource management. Creating sustainable practices even in challenging conditions tells us so much about their priorities!

>>Linguist: Speaking of priorities, Nahuatl evolved during this time too—it adapted terms for rituals and warfare central to their culture.

>>Religious Studies Scholar: The creation of these floating gardens was not merely an agricultural innovation but a sacred act that honored the gods and ensured cosmic balance. This tells us a lot about their spiritual priorities.

>>Sociologist: It's interesting how these innovations supported social cohesion by providing food security for large populations. This would have had significant impacts on social structures.

>>Historian: Right, it’s important we consider all aspects when evaluating historical innovations like these. 
 >>Religious Studies Scholar: The Aztecs believed that chinampas were sacred gifts from the gods, ensuring cosmic balance and societal prosperity. It's fascinating how they saw agricultural innovations as spiritually significant. What does this tell us about our own beliefs?
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! Their view highlights how spiritual beliefs can drive innovation. This intertwining ensured not just survival but prosperity—creating harmony between society and nature.
>>Archaeologist: And we see this reflected in material evidence too. These floating gardens weren't just practical; they were sacred spaces embodying their connection to the cosmos. What secrets might these artifacts hold about our relationship with innovation today?
>>Historian: Right! This profound integration of spirituality with innovation fostered societal cohesion and prosperity. Can we learn something here about how spiritual beliefs might drive modern innovations?
>>Linguist: Interesting point! Even Nahuatl evolved due to these spiritual beliefs—the terminology around agriculture was influenced by the sacredness of chinampas. How has this shaped our understanding of their innovations?
>>Sociologist: Indeed! Their belief created a unique social structure driven by religious devotion—ensuring advancements fulfilled both earthly needs and cosmic duties. How do similar structures influence us today? 
 >>Historian: Historically, the Aztec Empire's governance reforms under leaders like Moctezuma I and Nezahualcoyotl were pivotal in maintaining control over vast territories. These reforms included the establishment of a tribute system that ensured political stability and economic integration across diverse regions. What can we learn from this about creating governance structures that balance central authority with local empowerment today?
>>Anthropologist: The Aztec tribute system balanced central authority with local autonomy, which could inspire modern governance structures that respect local traditions while ensuring overall stability.
>>Sociologist: Building on what the Anthropologist mentioned, the tribute system indeed offers a compelling model for balancing central authority with local autonomy. This approach ensured political stability and economic integration while respecting local traditions. How do these structures influence our lives today?
>>Religious Studies Scholar: It's interesting how spirituality played a role in governance through integrating local deities with Huitzilopochtli, ensuring divine favor and societal cohesion. What does this tell us about the role of spirituality in governance today?
>>Archaeologist: The material evidence from the tribute system, like codices and artifacts, shows how local autonomy was respected while ensuring central control. What secrets do these artifacts hold about balancing governance structures today?
>>Linguist: The evolution of Nahuatl during the Aztec Empire shows how administrative needs led to new terms and dialects across different regions.
>>Historian (interrupting): Sorry to jump in—can you tell us more about how Nahuatl evolved due to these governance changes? 
>>Linguist: Of course! The linguistic development was influenced by administrative needs which led to new terminologies and dialects emerging within different regions under Aztec control. This interplay shaped our understanding of how language can reflect broader socio-political dynamics. 
 >>Sociologist: You know, to innovate, we need to understand how our social setup helps or blocks creativity. Creating spaces where different viewpoints are welcomed can lead to breakthroughs. How do these structures shape our lives?
>>Anthropologist: Absolutely! Looking at indigenous societies like the Aztecs, they had a tribute system that supported local traditions while contributing to a larger network. This tells us a lot about creating inclusive environments for innovation.
>>Historian: From a historical perspective, the Aztecs' tribute system is fascinating because it balanced central authority with local autonomy. But if we look at other periods, like the Renaissance, we see similar patterns where diverse ideas were encouraged under centralized support. What can we learn from these approaches?
>>Archaeologist: Right, and speaking of ancient techniques, modern labs can simulate these methods to inspire new technologies. For example, studying Roman aqueducts has led to advancements in water management today. What secrets do these artifacts hold?
>>Anthropologist: And beyond just the Aztecs, many indigenous cultures have practices that foster innovation by integrating diverse perspectives. The Maori's communal decision-making process is another great example. How can we apply this inclusivity in our own environments?

>>Linguist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! I just wanted to add that language plays a crucial role in this integration process as well.
>>Historian: Good point! The way the Aztecs adapted linguistically helped them govern and integrate various cultures effectively.

By allowing local autonomy while maintaining central oversight, they fostered creativity and stability. What can we learn from this in terms of balancing centralized control with encouraging diverse perspectives? 
 >>Sociologist: You know, the Aztec model of balancing central authority with local autonomy is really thought-provoking. It shows how social structures can foster innovation and stability. As we move forward, let's keep this balance in mind to ensure our collaborative efforts are effective.
>>Anthropologist: That's an interesting point about balance fostering innovation. I think it's also worth noting how their tribute system allowed for local customs to thrive under central rule. How do you think we can apply this concept today?
>>Historian: Absolutely! Historically speaking, this balance was crucial for their success. It's fascinating how they managed such diverse regions under one empire. Maybe we could look at integrating diverse perspectives in our projects similarly?
>>Archaeologist: Speaking of diversity, the material evidence we've discussed—like obsidian blades and chinampas—highlights their adaptability. These artifacts tell us so much about their daily lives and innovative approaches. We should definitely consider these insights moving forward.
>>Linguist: And linguistically, Nahuatl evolved significantly during the Aztec Empire due to administrative needs and cultural integration. This evolution shows their innovative spirit too. Embracing diverse perspectives will be key for us as well.
>>Religious Studies Scholar: Yes, spiritually speaking, their tribute system reflected deep cosmological beliefs that ensured harmony across regions. Integrating spiritual insights could enrich our collaborative efforts even further."
