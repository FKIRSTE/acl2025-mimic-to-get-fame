Political Communication,"Political communication is the study of political messaging that is communicated, usually to the public e.g. political campaigns, speeches and political advertising, often concerning the mass media.[1] It is an interdisciplinary field that draws from communication studies and political science. Political communication is concerned with ideas such as information flow, political influence, policy making, news, and public opinion.[2] The field also focuses on the study of political social media, propaganda, political economy of communication and non-profit organisations that communicate to affect political processes.[3][4] Modern societal changes that have affected the field include the digitization of media, polarization and a movement towards a post-truth media environment.

Political communication has existed since antiquity. During this era it was common for rulers to use symbols and monuments to communicate power and authority to the masses. In ancient Greece, public speeches such as those delivered by Pericles in Athens, played a crucial role in shaping political discourse and rallying public support for war efforts.[5]

During the era of the Roman Empire, political communication took on a more sophisticated form with the use of propaganda, rhetoric, and public spectacles in order to try and influence public opinion.[6] Figures famed for their political communication skills include Cicero.

After the creation of the print media with the dawn of the modern printing press in modern industrial Britain, this led to the ability to create modern mass media in the 20th century, which transformed political communication, giving rise to new forms of propaganda, advertising, and public relations.[7] Political leaders such as Winston Churchill and Franklin. D. Roosevelt utilized radio broadcasts to reach millions of listeners during times of crisis and war. Edward S. Herman notes that the expensive nature of the printing press meant that early on in the technology's existence, labour and co-operative organisations were easily priced out of the press media market due to capital constraints, meaning that corporations obtained an early grip on the market.[7] Herman therefore argues that this meant early on in the mass media of Britain, corporate right-wing voices would self-select editors to run their newspapers, stopping organised working class and left-wing voices from participating in the mass media market.[7]

During the 1990s and the early 2000s political spin had become common place as a form of political communication, with these political communicators known as spin doctors . For example governments like Tony Blair's in The United Kingdom and George W. Bush were known for this.[8] Tony Blair's Press Secretary Alistair Campbell, who was previously a journalist,[9] had the job of spinning bad situations that showed the British government in a bad light, by using press briefings with the British media.[10] Campbell became an influential and controversial addition to the political communication toolkit of Tony Blair's Labour government in the United Kingdom. This practice became standard in subsequent governments in Western countries like the United Kingdom[11] and the United States, with dedicated 'briefing rooms' whereby members of government address and communicate with the countries' press, which have came to be known as spin rooms.

Today, due to the diversification of media during the digital age, political communication now also includes online platforms like social media, free online news channels on services like YouTube, X (previously Twitter), Meta platforms and online News Websites. This has changed how the public and voters receive their political news and information. For example Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 are notable for mobilizing supporters, as they helped innovate the use of social media to engage voters and raise funds.[12] Volodymyr Zelenskyy's successful 2019 Presidential Campaign also featured heavy usage of social media posts.[13]

Today, Political communication continues to evolve quickly, as new technologies such as AI and big data analytics have begun to reshape how campaigns can target and persuade voters. However, this has led to large concerns regarding misinformation, echo chambers, and online polarization.[14] Recent election manipulation events like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal have now become an issue.[15] The company was found to have assisted Donald Trump's election campaign by unethically mining user's Facebook data, exemplifying increased levels of distrust of corporate and political institutions by the public.[16]

Darren G. Lilleker states that key concepts include:[4]

Brian McNair states that key areas of study include:[17]


Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, define political communication as concerning the modes and intentions of message senders when attempting to influence the political environment.[citation needed] This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decisions, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. 
""...the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose.""[citation needed]
Political communication has long used political persuasion, which is a key subfield for rhetoric studies. Political figures understand the role of the media in gaining the acceptance of voters.[18] For example, political communication delivered through social media tends to be accompanied by social interaction and public opinion.[19]

In political communication, rhetorical strategies such as logos, ethos, and pathos[20] are commonly used to persuade audiences, alongside techniques like metaphors, narratives, and strategic discourse, which shape public perception and influence opinion.[21] These rhetorical techniques contribute to framing, a process that determines how political issues are presented and understood. Through generic framing in the media, political rhetoric can emphasize conflict (contestation), political competition (strategic-game/horse-race), personal stories(human interest), economic consequences, or moral justifications.[22] These choices shape how the public interprets political events and policies, reinforcing certain viewpoints while downplaying others.

The rhetorical presidency highlights how persuasion and public communication have evolved, particularly through presidential speeches. Originally, directed at Congress, the State of the Union address became a direct appeal to the public, with Franklin Roosevelt leveraging radio and television to transform into a national event. This shift, alongside the increasing use of inclusive language, underscores the growing role of rhetoric in shaping public opinion.[23] Barack Obama exemplified this modern approach by using rhetorical devices like parallelism, repetition, and metaphor to create emotional resonance, further cementing the presidency as a platform for persuasion.[citation needed]

David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo define political communication in relation to strategic communications as ""the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters.""[24] They emphasize this strategic nature of political communication by highlighting the role of persuasion in political discourse. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is ""purposeful communication about politics."" For Brian McNair, this means that this not only covers verbal or written statements, but also visual representations such as dress attire, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. In other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a 'political identity' or 'image'.[citation needed] According to Harald Borgebund, the author of Political Communication and the Realities of Democracy, ""Political communication is essential in a democratic polity.""[citation needed]

In terms of political communication and its relationship to modern agenda-setting, Vian Bakir defines strategic political communication as comprising 'political communication that is manipulative in intent, utilizes social scientific techniques and heuristic devices to understand human motivation, human behavior and the media environment in order to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing public opinion, and creating strategic alliances and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.[25]

To further expand on why political communication can be viewed as manipulative, Michael Gurevitch and Jay G. Blumler[24] state that ""the very structure of political communication involves a division between movers and shakers at the top and bystanders below."" Public access television has been one way in which political communication has been commbatted. Dr. Laura Stein states that  ""public access [television] has opened up a space for grassroots political communication on television""[24]

In regards to the Political Strategic Communication in The USA one example is the Bush Administration's torture-for-intelligence policy, initiated after 9/11, which was kept secret for several years.[citation needed] While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, revealed by the Abu Ghraib torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in strategic political communication to attempt to publicly re-frame and protect its policies.[citation needed] Strategic political communication during the event included both silencing and persuasive discursive activity.[26]

Discursive activity aimed at silencing consisted of plea bargains, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings[citation needed], deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security[citation needed], weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online,[citation needed] and suppression of visual sousveillance of torture while court–martials and criminal investigations proceeded.[citation needed] Destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees also occurred.[citation needed] Those that were complicit aimed at suppressing this information to minimize public interest and discussion.[27]

Persuasive discursive activity included the propagation and repetition of key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting public attention from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages included: that detainees were evil and dangerous terrorists,[citation needed] that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic,[citation needed] that interrogation techniques,[citation needed] although were legal,[citation needed] that they were necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror,[citation needed] and that Guantánamo was a model prison.[citation needed] Key British administration messages initially indicated igonorance of the American intelligence agencies’ new strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened, and then indicated that no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies were involved in extraordinary rendition.[citation needed] Key messages common to both the British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy. [citation needed] This being indicated from changes to Army training and interrogation guidance under both the Bush and Blair Administrations.[citation needed] These messages were propagated through a range of discursive activities (including press conferences and media interviews, authorized leaks, real–time reporting, official investigations and public inquiries) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents.[citation needed] The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling,[citation needed] positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable.[citation needed]

According to Jake Sherman and Albert Trithart, “United Nations peace operations often struggle to communicate their messages to the local population and the broader global community.”[citation needed] It argued, therefore, that “the outdated public information approach of the United Nations must be transformed into more dynamic communications efforts.”, ""This required missions to better understand key audiences, make better use of national staff, embrace technology, train leaders in effective communication, proactively engage with local populations, and tailor both the message and means of communication to particular audiences.""[28]

The Middle East

Kai Hafez states that when discussing the Middle East concerning projects like e-projects “supported by a U.S. administration, are at best visionary and without any real practical use”.[29] Concerning censorship, Hussein Amin states that “-because many people view censorship as a sign of social responsibility, civil society has a deep distrust of itself. While admitting that political communication in the mass media has diversified and developed some more liberal patterns in recent years”.[29] Further when it comes to national identities Nisbet et al., state that “Mass media have long been linked to the historical development and emergence of national identities and the modern nation-state by creating bounded spaces of political communication and discourse"".[30]

In cases like the on-going conflict like in Syria, the majority of media formats are censored towards the Middle East in order to avoid further catastrophization of an event, possibly by the West.[clarification needed] For example, in Syria, the Rebel Free Syrian Army was created as an opposition to Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship.[31]

During a political economy analysis of U.S. mass communications, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky developed a model during the 1980s call the propaganda model.[32] It theorized that the interests of globalized elites in the US were warping the journalistic integrity of the mass media and its attempts to communicate news, to critique modern Western communications. They suggest that the political consent of the electorate would also be damaged by this type of politicized news in the mass media:

""The more elusive or imaginary the foe, the better for manufacturing consent. The picture of the world that's presented to the public has only the remotest relation to reality.""[33]
In terms of political communication, the propaganda model is generally used in the context of the globalized American corporate media and how it organically acts in the interests of corporate elites, specifically in an anti-democratic way. Therefore, Herman and Chomsky argue that the interests of the corporate elites are not overly concerned with the democratic rights of citizens and that this creates a new form of propaganda, which has damaging effects on democracies like the United States Government.[33]

Social media has become an increasingly important tool for political communication. For certain demographics it is one of the main platforms from which individuals acquire their news, and allows them to interact with it via commenting and sharing.[34] Social media has dramatically changed the way in which modern political campaigns are run.[35][36] With more digital native citizens coming into the voting population, social media has become an important medium where politicians can establish themselves and engage with voters.[37] In an increasingly digitized world, new research has shown that social media is becoming increasingly important in electoral politics.[38]

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior.[39] Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same ""fact-checking processes as institutional journalism.""[40]

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive.[41]

In Australia 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,[42] around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, with 9,530,314 Australian voters using social media. The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report also found that among internet users, 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% in 2014.[43]

With almost half of the Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.[44] Studies have found that journalists in Australia widely use social media in a professional context and that it has become a viable method of communication between the mainstream media and wider audiences.[45]

It was noted that political communication encompasses various forms such as campaigns, speeches, advertising, and social media, drawing from both communication studies and political science. Historical examples included ancient Greece and Rome where symbols, rhetoric, and public spectacles were used to influence public opinion. The advent of print media in Britain transformed political communication by enabling mass media, though early corporate control limited diverse voices. The rise of spin doctors in the late 20th century highlighted strategic manipulation in politics. Modern digital platforms like social media have further revolutionized political communication, exemplified by Barack Obama's campaigns and Volodymyr Zelenskyy's use of social media. Concerns about misinformation and polarization were discussed, with recent scandals like Facebook-Cambridge Analytica illustrating distrust in corporate-political institutions. Rhetorical strategies such as logos, ethos, pathos, metaphors, narratives, and framing were identified as key tools for shaping public perception. The role of persuasion in presidential speeches was emphasized with examples from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama. Strategic communications aim to influence public knowledge and beliefs through manipulative techniques. Issues in global contexts like the Middle East were also addressed regarding censorship and national identities. Social media's growing importance in electoral politics was acknowledged along with its potential for greater political persuasion.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Participants briefly greet each other and set the tone for a collaborative meeting.\n- Brief welcome from the facilitator\n- Quick acknowledgment of familiar faces\n- Setting expectations for open dialogue and collaboration"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Political Communication\nTLDR: Discuss the evolution of political communication from ancient times to modern digital platforms.\n- Historian shares insights on ancient Greece and Rome's use of rhetoric\n- Media Analyst highlights transformation with print media in Britain\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions on historical examples"", ""Scene 3: Impact of Mass Media and Social Media\nTLDR: Explore how mass media and social media have shaped political communication.\n- Social Media Expert discusses digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter\n- Communication Strategist talks about strategic manipulation by spin doctors\n- Participants share personal experiences with social media influence"", ""Scene 4: Rhetorical Strategies in Political Communication\nTLDR: Examine rhetorical tools used in shaping public perception.\n- Rhetoric Specialist explains logos, ethos, pathos, metaphors, narratives\n- Political Scientist provides analytical insight into persuasion techniques in speeches\n- Opportunity for debate on effectiveness of different strategies"", ""Scene 5: Challenges and Concerns in Modern Political Communication\nTLDR: Address issues such as misinformation, polarization, and corporate distrust.\n- Discussion on Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal led by Media Analyst\n- Participants express concerns over censorship in global contexts like the Middle East\n- Spontaneous sharing of thoughts on potential solutions"", ""Scene 6: Aligning Project Objectives Across Departments\nTLDR: Focus on aligning shared objectives to enhance interdepartmental collaboration.\n- Facilitator guides discussion towards project alignment goals\n- Open dialogue for resolving cross-departmental issues raised by participants\n- Encouragement for sharing innovative ideas to improve collaboration"", ""Scene 7: Closing Remarks and Next Steps\nTLDR: Summarize key points discussed and outline next steps for continued collaboration.\n- Facilitator recaps aligned objectives and resolved issues \n- Participants suggest follow-up actions or meetings \n- Brief informal chat reflecting on personal takeaways""]",">>Political Scientist: Good to see everyone here. I'm looking forward to a productive discussion today.
>>Media Analyst: Hey everyone, great to be here! Let's dive into today's topics with an open mind.
>>Communication Strategist: Absolutely! It's great to see everyone. Let's focus on practical strategies that can be applied effectively through teamwork.
>>Historian: It's great to see everyone here today. Collaboration has always driven progress; let's keep our dialogue open and constructive as we explore these topics.
>>Social Media Expert: Hi everyone! Excited for today's discussion—let's leverage our digital tools for better collaboration.
>>Rhetoric Specialist: Great to see you all! Looking forward to some insightful conversations. 
 >>Historian: Well, the use of rhetoric in ancient Greece and Rome was foundational to political communication. Figures like Cicero and Pericles mastered the art of persuasion, shaping public opinion through eloquent speeches. You know, what can we learn from this?

>>Media Analyst: Like, the transformation with print media in Britain was a game-changer! It allowed political leaders to reach a wider audience and control the narrative more effectively. I mean, do you see what I mean?

>>Communication Strategist: Building on our understanding of ancient rhetoric, let's consider how print media transformed political communication before we dive into today's digital landscape. Cicero's techniques were all about connecting with his audience—using emotion and logic. We could apply similar strategies today by crafting messages that resonate emotionally with voters.

>>Social Media Expert: That's a great point about emotional connection! The digital age has taken political communication to a whole new level. Social media platforms have become the modern-day agora where politicians can engage directly with voters. How do you think this impacts voter engagement?

>>Political Scientist: It's interesting to see how these strategies have changed over time. From ancient symbols and monuments to modern digital platforms, each era adapts its methods to influence public opinion effectively. The digital age brings new challenges we need to tackle—like misinformation spreading rapidly.

>>Media Analyst: Honestly, just look at how quickly misinformation can spread on digital platforms and influence public opinion—it's mind-blowing! At the end of the day, it's a double-edged sword.

>>Political Scientist: Exactly! The rapid dissemination of information requires us to be more strategic in engaging with the electorate. What are some successful campaigns that have navigated these challenges well?

>>Historian: Interestingly enough, Cicero's speeches were meticulously crafted to persuade and influence public opinion back then. Maybe we should look at modern examples like Obama's campaign for inspiration on effective messaging.

>>Communication Strategist: Absolutely! Obama's use of social media was groundbreaking in reaching younger voters and creating a sense of community online—something Cicero would appreciate if he were around today!

>>Rhetoric Specialist: Clearly, mastering persuasive techniques is crucial for effective political discourse today as it was back then. 
 >>Social Media Expert: You know, social media has really changed how politicians talk to voters. They can now reach out directly without going through traditional media. It's pretty amazing, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.
>>Political Scientist: That's true. While it's great for direct engagement, it also opens the door to misinformation and echo chambers. Have you noticed how these platforms can both connect people and drive them apart?
>>Media Analyst: Absolutely, it's a tricky balance. On one hand, more voices are heard; on the other hand, there's a risk of spreading false information quickly. Maybe we should look at some examples where this has affected political outcomes.
>>Communication Strategist: Right, and politicians have become experts at using these platforms to tell stories that really hit home with voters. It's not just about sharing facts anymore; it's about creating narratives that stick in people's minds.
>>Historian: If we look back, every era had its own way of communicating politically—from speeches in ancient times to today's digital messages. What do you think we can learn from history about keeping information accurate while engaging people?
>>Political Scientist: Social media definitely plays a big role in shaping political conversations today. It brings people together but can also spread misleading information. How do you think we can encourage more responsible use of these platforms?
>>Media Analyst: Good point! We're dealing with a mix of benefits and drawbacks when it comes to social media's influence on politics. Finding the right balance between engaging audiences and ensuring accuracy is key.
>>Rhetoric Specialist: And let's not forget how quickly things can change with just one tweet or post—it’s like watching public opinion shift overnight sometimes.
>>Social Media Expert: Exactly! The way content is tailored for each user is powerful but risky too because it might reinforce existing biases instead of challenging them.
>>Political Scientist: Yeah...and those who manage political campaigns have gotten really good at crafting messages that resonate emotionally with voters—it's all about shaping perceptions now rather than just presenting facts. 
 >>Rhetoric Specialist: Persuasion in politics is fascinating. It's not just about the facts; it's about how those facts are framed and presented. Metaphors, for example, can turn a boring policy into a story that really connects with people.

>>Communication Strategist: Absolutely. The key is weaving these rhetorical tools into a narrative that resonates emotionally with voters. A good metaphor or story can shift public perception and drive engagement.

>>Political Scientist: Right, but the effectiveness of these strategies often depends on the context. For instance, metaphors can be powerful when discussing economic hardship because they make abstract concepts relatable. Narratives also help create a sense of identity among voters.

>>Media Analyst: Exactly! These strategies can unite or divide public opinion based on how they're used. It's crucial to assess their impact in real-time and adapt accordingly.

>>Political Scientist: Yes, using ethos and pathos effectively is like balancing emotional appeal with credibility. These elements sway public opinion by tapping into deeply held beliefs and emotions.

>>Media Analyst: It's interesting how these strategies sometimes reflect audiences' beliefs back at them. Could this mirroring effect be why some speeches resonate so deeply?

>>Historian: Historically speaking, political communication has always been about persuasion and perception. Figures like Cicero mastered rhetoric to sway public opinion much like today's politicians use social media to craft their narratives.

>>Social Media Expert: In today's digital age, social media amplifies political rhetoric directly to voters. But does this immediacy sometimes lead to more divisive narratives?

>>Communication Strategist: When we align ethos and pathos with compelling stories, we're not just informing; we're inspiring action! This approach turns passive listeners into active supporters.

>>Rhetoric Specialist: Combining logic with emotion creates compelling narratives that can either strengthen or undermine credibility depending on execution.

>>Historian: The evolution from ancient times shows a consistent reliance on rhetorical strategies—Cicero used speeches to shape opinions much like today’s politicians use social media.

>>Social Media Expert: Social media's speed spreads narratives faster than ever—but do you think it sometimes leads towards polarization rather than unity? 
 >>Media Analyst: The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal really shook people's trust in social media and political institutions. We need to find ways to ensure transparency and accountability.

>>Political Scientist: Yeah, it definitely highlighted how data can be manipulated to influence voter behavior. This has made people more aware of the need for stricter regulations and ethical standards in digital campaigning.

>>Communication Strategist: Right, we should focus on tackling misinformation and polarization. Enhancing media literacy among voters and promoting transparent communication from political entities could make a big difference.

>>Social Media Expert: Honestly, the scandal showed just how important digital engagement is in modern politics. We need strategies that not only reach voters but also build trust and transparency. It's crazy how one event can change public perception so much.

>>Historian: Manipulating public opinion through corporate interests isn't new. We've seen similar tactics throughout history used by powerful entities to sway sentiment. Maybe it's time we reinforce ethical standards that have been eroded over time.

>>Political Scientist: Moreover, the scandal exemplifies the impact of data manipulation on democratic processes. We must rethink our regulatory frameworks and ethical standards in political communication, considering both transparency and the integrity of information shared with the public.

>>Media Analyst: Exactly! The scandal exposed how vulnerable our data is to manipulation. It's not just about transparency; it's about safeguarding democratic processes from corporate greed!

>>Historian: It reminds me of historical instances where information was manipulated for political ends—propaganda shaping public perception leading to significant shifts in societal norms. Reflecting on these tactics' evolution might help us reinforce ethical standards ensuring integrity in political communication.

>>Rhetoric Specialist: Clearly, this scandal is a clear case of persuasive techniques being weaponized to manipulate opinion. We need to look closely at these tactics ethically! Transparency and accountability are crucial for protecting our democratic processes.

>>Communication Strategist: Absolutely! Enhancing media literacy among voters and promoting transparent communication from political entities is key here. These small steps can lead to substantial changes.
