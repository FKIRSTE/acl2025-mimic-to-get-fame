Super Bowl,"

The Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League of the United States. It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, superseding the NFL Championship Game. Since 2022, the game has been played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003,[a] and the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the Packers coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Because the NFL restricts the use of its ""Super Bowl"" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the ""big game"" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is held is commonly referred to as ""Super Bowl Sunday"" or simply ""Super Sunday"".

The game was created as part of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the competing American Football League (AFL) to have their 'best' teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the AFL–NFL World Championship Game until the ""Super Bowl"" moniker was adopted in 1969's Super Bowl III. The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played prior to the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three of the NFL teams formed the American Football Conference (AFC) and the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the National Football Conference (NFC). All games since 1971's Super Bowl V have been played between the best team from each of the two conferences, with the AFC and NFC tied at 29 wins each.

Among the NFL's current 32 teams, 20 (11 NFC, nine AFC) have won a Super Bowl and 16 (eight AFC, eight NFC) hold multiple titles. The AFC's Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl titles at six each. The Patriots also have the most Super Bowl appearances at 11.[1] The Patriots and the Denver Broncos of the AFC hold the record for the most defeats in the Super Bowl at five each. The Baltimore Ravens of the AFC and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFC are the only franchises to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls, having each won two. Among the 12 teams who have not won a Super Bowl, the AFC's Cleveland Browns, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars, and the NFC's Detroit Lions are the only four to have not appeared in the game.

The Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual club sporting event worldwide,[2] and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.[3] Its halftime shows feature top artists, and headlining a Super Bowl is considered one of the highest honors in music.[4][3] Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind Thanksgiving dinner,[5] with fans commonly purchasing beer, hot dogs, nachos, and other concessions, spending an average of $58 on food and drinks during an NFL game. [4]

Since the turn of the 20th century, college football teams from across the United States have scheduled ""bowl games"" against each other. The original ""bowl game"" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the ""Tournament East–West football game"" as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses. In 1923, the Tournament East-West football game moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium; the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was  part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The Tournament of Roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term ""bowl"" for any major American football game was well established.[6]

For four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. After the AFL's inaugural season, AFL commissioner Joe Foss sent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a ""World Playoff"" game between the two leagues' champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season.[7] The first World Playoff game, if actually played, would have matched up the AFL champion Houston Oilers against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers.[8]

In the mid-1960s, Lamar Hunt, owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term ""Super Bowl""[9] to refer to the AFL–NFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy;[10] a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, ""I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.""

The leagues' owners chose the name ""AFL–NFL Championship Game"",[11] but in July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing ""the Super Bowl—that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues"",[12] and the media immediately began using the term.[13] Although the league stated in May 1967 that ""not many people like it"", asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as ""Merger Bowl"", ""Summit Bowl"", and ""The Game"",[14] the Associated Press reported that ""Super Bowl"" ""grew and grew and grew—until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum"".[11] ""Super Bowl"" became official beginning with the third annual game.[15]

Roman numerals are used to identify each Super Bowl, rather than the year in which it is held, since the fifth edition, in January 1971.[16] The sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with Super Bowl 50, played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 season. The following year, the nomenclature returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl LI.

After the NFL's Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's New York Jets defeated the heavily favored NFL contender Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL–NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.

The winning team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the former coach of the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games as well as five NFL championships preceding the merger (1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, 1967). Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named after him. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in Super Bowl V in Miami.

The Super Bowl was held in January from its inception in 1967 until 2001. In 2002, a week of regular season games was postponed and rescheduled following the September 11 attacks; as a result, Super Bowl XXXVI became the first edition of the game played in February. Super Bowl XXXVII was held in January, but all subsequent games were held on the first Sunday in February until the schedule expansion of the 2021 season moved the game to the second Sunday.[17]

The current NFL schedule begins on the weekend immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September). That weekend is the first of an 18-week regular season, followed by three weeks of playoff games and one week for the Pro Bowl. The Super Bowl is contested the week after the Pro Bowl. This schedule has been in effect since an 18th week and 17th regular season game were added to the NFL schedule for the 2021 season, with Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the first to be played under this format.

The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots are tied with a record six Super Bowl wins. The Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have five victories each, while the Packers, Chiefs and New York Giants have four. Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl.

The Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances with eleven. The Cowboys, Steelers, Broncos and the 49ers are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, reaching that milestone in this respective order. Bill Belichick owns the record for the most Super Bowl wins (eight) and appearances (twelve: nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator) by an individual. Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (ten) and wins as a player (seven), while Charles Haley has the second-most wins among players with five.

Eight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to appear four times without a win, while the Buffalo Bills played in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, losing all four matches. The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl losses at five.

The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars are the four teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl, although the Browns and Lions both won NFL championships before the Super Bowl era. The Jaguars, who began play in 1995, and the Texans, who began play in 2002, are among the youngest franchises in the league.

The Packers won the first two AFL–NFL World Championship Games, later renamed Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively.[18][19] The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games.[20] These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967). The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931). The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932.

In Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the 19.5-point favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16–7.[21] The Jets were led by quarterback Joe Namath, who had said that he guaranteed a Jets win before the game, and former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory demonstrated that the AFL was competitive with the NFL.[22] This was reinforced the following year when the Chiefs defeated the NFL's Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV.[23]

After the AFL–NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises—the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers—would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls between them in the decade, with the Steelers winning four of the eight.

The Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley).[24][25] Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.

The Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super Bowl VI over the Dolphins.[26] However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14–0 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14–7 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team in the Super Bowl era to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason undefeated.[27][28] The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later with a 24–7 win over the Minnesota Vikings.[29]

In the mid to late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) in six years.[30][31][32][33] They were led by head coach Chuck Noll,[34] the play of offensive stars Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster, and their dominant ""Steel Curtain"" defense, led by ""Mean"" Joe Greene, L. C. Greenwood, Ernie Holmes, Mel Blount, Jack Ham, and Jack Lambert. Many of the team's key players were selected in the 1974 draft, in which Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft.[35] A fifth player, Donnie Shell, was signed by Pittsburgh after going unselected in the 1974 NFL Draft; he too was later enshrined in the Hall of Fame.[36] The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six AFC Championship Games during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons.[37] Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.[38][39]

The Steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the Raiders' first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XI and the Cowboys' second Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XII.[40][41] Conversely, the Vikings, with their Purple People Eaters defense, were the only other team to appear in multiple Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX and XI) during the decade but failed to win each one.[42]

In the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.

The most successful team of the 1980s was the 49ers, which featured the West Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh.[43] This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, running back Roger Craig, and Hall of Fame defensive safety/cornerback Ronnie Lott. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.[44][45][46][47] The 1984 San Francisco 49ers were the first team to achieve an 18–1 record, doing so under Walsh. The 1989 San Francisco 49ers, under first-year head coach George Seifert, posted the most lop-sided victory in Super Bowl history, defeating the Denver Broncos by a score of 55–10 in Super Bowl XXIV.[48]

The 1980s also produced the 1985 Chicago Bears, who posted an 18–1 record under head coach Mike Ditka; quarterback Jim McMahon; and Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton.[49] Their team won Super Bowl XX in dominant fashion.[50] The Washington Redskins and New York Giants were also top teams of this period; Washington won Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI.[51][52][53] The Giants claimed Super Bowls XXI and XXV.[54][55] Both teams won multiple Super Bowls with different starting quarterbacks; Washington won with Joe Theismann (XVII), Doug Williams (XXII) and Mark Rypien (XXVI), and the Giants with Phil Simms (XXI) and Jeff Hostetler (XXV). As in the 1970s, the Raiders were the only AFC team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of NFC teams; they won Super Bowls XV and XVIII (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).[56][57]

Conversely, the Cincinnati Bengals (XVI and XXIII), Dolphins, (XVII and XIX), and Broncos (XXI, XXII and XXIV) made multiple Super Bowls in the 1980s without winning one.[58][59][60]

Following several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997.[61] From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year.[62] In this same period, the Buffalo Bills reached the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, but lost all four (XXV-XXVIII).[63][64][65] After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin.[66][67][68] All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who were the first team to win their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young (who threw a Super Bowl record 6 touchdown passes), Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers.[69][70] The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Packers led by Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in 1967.[71]

The Patriots made their maiden Super Bowl appearances in XX (1985) and XXXI (1996) but lost both times.[72] However, the turn of the century would soon bring hope and glory to the franchise.[73]

Super Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak.[74] The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game.[75] The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams—the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts—accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.[76]

The New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade.[77] They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20–17 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams, who two seasons earlier won Super Bowl XXXIV.[78][79] Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[80] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively.[81][82] This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48–21 Super Bowl XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders.[83]

The Steelers and Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and XLI in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.[84][85]

In the 2007 season, the Patriots became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular-season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16–0.[86] They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17–14, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18–1.[87]

The following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27–23, final-minute victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[88]

The 2009 season saw the New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV by a score of 31–17 to take home their first championship.[89] With this victory, the Saints joined the New York Jets as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance, a distinction the Ravens also enjoyed in winning Super Bowl XXXV after the 2000 season and the Buccaneers in 2002.[90]

In the AFC, this era was dominated by the Patriots, with the only four other teams to represent the conference being the Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, and Chiefs. The Patriots had tied a record with the 1970s Dallas Cowboys for most Super Bowl appearances in a decade with five appearances (2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). The Patriots also had four Super Bowl appearances in five years.  They also had eight consecutive AFC championship appearances spanning 2011–2018.[91]

The Super Bowls of the 2000s and 2010s saw strong performances from several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side with repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls from 2001 through 2018.[92] Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl multiple times with the same quarterback in this era were the Seahawks, led by quarterback Russell Wilson, and the Giants, led by quarterback Eli Manning.

One of these teams was featured in the culmination of the 2010 season, Super Bowl XLV, which brought the Packers their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the Steelers in February 2011.[93] This became Aaron Rodgers' only Super Bowl victory.

The following year, in Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the Eli Manning-led Giants, 21–17, who had beaten the Patriots four years before.[94] This was the Giants' fourth Super Bowl victory.[95]

In Super Bowl XLVII, the NFC's 49ers were defeated by the Ravens 34–31.[96] The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, are brothers.[97] During the third quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28–6 lead. However, there was a blackout in New Orleans, where the game was being played.[98] The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost.

Super Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold-weather environment.[99] The Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43–8 defeat of the Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.[100][101][102]

In Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28–24.[103] Down by 10, the Patriots mounted a late fourth quarter comeback to win the game with Tom Brady scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter.[104] In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then-rookie free agent Malcolm Butler would intercept a pass by Russell Wilson at the one-yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game.[105] Tom Brady was awarded his third Super Bowl MVP, tying Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.[106]

In Super Bowl 50, the first Super Bowl to be branded with Arabic numerals,[107] the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career.[108][109] Von Miller dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two Cam Newton fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.[110][111]

In Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime,[112] the Atlanta Falcons led 28–3 late in the third quarter, but the Patriots came back to tie the game 28–28 with back-to-back touchdowns and two-point conversions, and the Patriots went on to win 34–28 in overtime.[113] This 25-point deficit was the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of a 10-point deficit to come back and win.[114] The Patriots never held the lead until the game-winning touchdown in overtime. It was Tom Brady's 5th Super Bowl win and he was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP, throwing a then-record 466 yards for 43 completions.[115][116][117]

In Super Bowl LII, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the defending champion Patriots 41–33, ending a 57-year championship drought for the franchise.[118] Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP.[119] The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with Tom Brady breaking his previous Super Bowl record of 466 passing yards with an all-time playoff record of 505 passing yards in the high-scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in the victory.[120][121] The combined total for both teams of 1,151 yards of offense broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades.[122] The Patriots' 33 points were the highest losing score in Super Bowl history, a record held until 2023, when the Eagles lost Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38–35.[123] It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance and their first win in franchise history. With the Eagles' victory, the NFC East became the first division to have each team win at least one Super Bowl.[124]

While Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's Super Bowl LIII became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13–3. In so doing, they became the team with the lowest point total by a winning team in Super Bowl history.[125]  Tom Brady would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with Charles Haley for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while Bill Belichick would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66.[126] Wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP.[127]

In Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in a comeback, 31–20, for their first Super Bowl title in 50 years.[128] This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than the AFC. The Patriots were absent; after making it to the Super Bowl in each of the last three years and winning two of them, they had lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the Tennessee Titans 20–13.[129][130]  That game represented Tom Brady's final game as a New England Patriot.[131]

In Super Bowl LV, which took place in Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the defending champion Chiefs, 31–9.[132][133] No player on the Buccaneers who scored points (Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, Leonard Fournette, and Ryan Succop) was on the Buccaneers' roster the previous season.[134] This marked a record seventh Super Bowl victory for Tom Brady, also more than any individual NFL franchise, and who would also break his own record for the oldest quarterback to win a championship at 43 years old.[135][136] Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians would also break Bill Belichick's record for the oldest head coach to win a championship at 68.[137] Super Bowl LV also marked the first time in the history of the modern league that a host city's professional football franchise got to play in a Super Bowl that was hosted in their home stadium.[138]

A year later in Inglewood, California, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20 to win Super Bowl LVI, becoming the second team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium.[139]

On February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the Chiefs overcame a 10-point deficit at halftime to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles 38–35, winning Super Bowl LVII on a last-minute field goal.[140]

On February 11, 2024, the Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium on an overtime touchdown. The first Super Bowl in Las Vegas, this was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV between the 49ers and the Chiefs, and was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years. The second Super Bowl to go into overtime, the Chiefs came back from another 10-point deficit to win their third Super Bowl in five years and secure back-to-back championships for the first time since the 2004 New England Patriots.[141]

On February 9, 2025, Patrick Mahomes went to his fifth Super Bowl since he became the starting quarterback. The Chiefs played the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX. This was the second time the Chiefs rematched another team in the Super Bowl. The Eagles successfully avenged their Super Bowl LVII defeat, winning 40–22 after leading 34–0 at the end of the third quarter and preventing the Chiefs from becoming the first team to win three straight Super Bowl championships. Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP.

The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[2] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[2] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year.[142] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.

In press releases preceding the game, the NFL has claimed that the Super Bowl has a potential worldwide audience of around one billion people in over 200 countries.[143] However, this figure refers to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people who will actually be watching. Regardless, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in the media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a misperception about the game's actual global audience.[144][145] The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the Super Bowl XXXIX at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly two million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[144]

Super Bowl LVIII holds the record for average number of US viewers, with 123.7 million, making the game the most-viewed television broadcast of any kind in American history. The halftime show set a record with 129.2 million viewers tuning in.[146]

The highest-rated game according to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1% of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, with three other Super Bowls (XVII, XX, and XLIX) in the top ten.

Famous Super Bowl commercials include the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, the Budweiser ""Bud Bowl"" campaign, and the dot-com ads aired during Super Bowl XXXIV. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, commercial prices have also increased, with advertisers paying as much as $7 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.[147] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view commercials.[148] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[149]

Since 1991, the Super Bowl has begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during the primetime hours on the East Coast.[150]

Throughout most of its history, the Super Bowl has been rotated annually between the same American television networks that broadcast the NFL's regular season and postseason games.

Super Bowl I, played in 1967, is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[151][152]

Beginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL–NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after CBS replaced NBC as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that took effect for the first time with Super Bowl LVIII, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[153]

The four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[153] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon aired an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[154] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[153]

The NFL has broken the traditional broadcasting rotation if it can be used to bolster other major sporting events a network airs afterwards.[155][156][157] For example, CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI (1992) after it won the rights to air the 1992 Winter Olympics, with NBC subsequently airing Super Bowl XXVII (1993) and Super Bowl XXVIII (1994) in consecutive years. Likewise, NBC aired Super Bowl LVI (2022) instead of CBS during the 2022 Winter Olympics, which were also aired by NBC.[157] CBS received Super Bowl LV (2021) in return.[157] Under the four-network rotation that will take effect beginning in 2024, the league will award NBC the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years.[153]

The first six Super Bowls were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place. Super Bowl VII (1973) was telecast in Los Angeles on an experimental basis after all tickets were sold ten days before the game.[158]

Game analyst John Madden is the only person to broadcast a Super Bowl for each of the four networks that have televised the game (five with CBS, three with Fox, two with ABC, and one with NBC).

Note: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (will be played[ˇ]) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been.
^ *: The current TV contract with the networks expires after the 2033 season (or in early 2034). Under the deal, the Super Bowl is currently rotated annually between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC in that order. ABC returned to the rotation with that contract that took effect at the start of the 2023 season.[153] The contract does have an opt-out clause after the 2029 season (or in early 2030), with the exception for ABC's contract, whose opt-out clause is after the 2030 season (or in early 2031).[159]
^ **: The first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each network using the same video feed (from CBS), but providing its own commentary.

The Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted that following Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: ""A paid program that ran on CBS 4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.""[160]

Because of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.

Early Super Bowls featured a halftime show consisting of marching bands from local colleges or high schools; but as the popularity of the game increased, a trend emerged where popular singers and musicians performed during its pre-game ceremonies and the halftime show, or simply sang the national anthem of the United States, ""America the Beautiful"", or ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"".[161]

The U.S. national anthem has been performed at all but one Super Bowl: Super Bowl XI in 1977 when Vikki Carr sang ""America the Beautiful"" in place of the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, ""America the Beautiful"" is sung before the national anthem every year and is followed by the presentation of the colors and a military flyover preceding the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl LV in 2021, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" is sung prior to ""America the Beautiful"" in honor of Black History Month.

For many years, Whitney Houston's performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV in 1991, during the Gulf War, had long been regarded as one of the best renditions of the anthem in history.[162][163][164] Before Super Bowl XLVIII, soprano Renée Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the anthem.

Recently,[when?] the winner of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award has been acknowledged before ""America the Beautiful"" and ""The Star-Spangled Banner"".

Since Super Bowl XII in 1978, a former football player, a celebrity, or another special guest participates in the coin toss ceremony to recognize their community involvement or significance.

The pre-game ceremonies usually go in the following order:[165]

Unlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color caused a drop in viewership for the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached Michael Jackson, whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.[166][167] U2 performed at Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002; during their third song, ""Where the Streets Have No Name"", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 attacks.

The halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy, following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC (and a larger crackdown over ""indecent"" content broadcast on television), and MTV (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, CBS, under Viacom) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as the Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga.[168][169]

Minnesota Vikings announcer Alan Roach is the official public address announcer of the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006, with the exceptions of Super Bowl XLVIII, XLIX and 50 when the Denver Broncos played in those games. Roach was also Denver's regular P.A. announcer during those years, and thus the league felt it was a potential competitive advantage. In those years, NFL on Westwood One host and NFL Films voice Scott Graham held the duties.[170]

Excluding Super Bowl XXXIX, the ""I'm going to Disney World!"" advertising campaign took place in every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXI in 1987, when quarterback Phil Simms from the Giants became the first player to say the tagline.

As of Super Bowl LIX, 30 of 59 Super Bowls have been played in three metropolitan areas: the Greater Miami area (eleven times),[171] New Orleans (eleven times), and the Greater Los Angeles area (eight times). No market or region without an active NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game.[172][173] For instance, while Los Angeles has been an eight-time host city, with its most recent being Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until the Rams and the Chargers subsequently returned to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans has hosted eight Super Bowls, the most of any venue. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.

Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, five of Los Angeles's Bowls were played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.

To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[174] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in New Jersey—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule, with a contingency plan to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall.[175] MetLife Stadium's selection over Sun Life Stadium generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to Sun Life Stadium (a venue afflicted with a heavy rainstorm during Super Bowl XLI) in order to be considered for future Super Bowls, which was done during a remodeling from 2015 into 2016. It then hosted Super Bowl LIV.[176]

There have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[177] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999 was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, but when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[178] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Super Bowl LV in 2021 was first awarded to the yet-to-be completed SoFi Stadium, but construction delays forced the game to be moved to Raymond James Stadium and SoFi Stadium was then given Super Bowl LVI in 2022.[179] Super Bowl LVIII in 2024 was first given to the Superdome, but the NFL's 2021 regular season expansion pushed the game from February 4 to February 11 in a direct conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras celebrations; Super Bowl LVIII was then moved to Allegiant Stadium in Nevada and New Orleans was given Super Bowl LIX in 2025.[180][181]

The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[182]

Through Super Bowl LVI, teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls, where cities submitted proposals to host a Super Bowl and were evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host, but this competition was rescinded in 2018.[needs update][174][183] The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII onward; the league chose a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team put together a hosting proposal, and the league voted upon it to determine if it is acceptable.[184]

In 2014, a document listing the specific requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what was required for a Super Bowl host.[185] Some of the host requirements include:

Much of the cost of a Super Bowl is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[187]

The NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[188]

The designated ""home team"" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[189][190] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has its team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 32 of 59 Super Bowls to date (approximately 54%).

Since Super Bowl XIII in 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing its colored or white jerseys. Originally, the designated home team had to wear its colored jerseys, which resulted in the Cowboys donning their less exposed[discuss] dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been seven exceptions: the Cowboys during Super Bowls XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Steelers during Super Bowl XL, the Broncos during Super Bowl 50, the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. The Cowboys, since 1964, have worn white jerseys at home. The Washington Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992, continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000, then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, but after winning road playoff games against the Jets and Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to scarlet for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, ""We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms""; they previously had been 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.[191][192] The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons.[193] The Patriots were 3–0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls before Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,[194][195] and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.[196][197][198] For Super Bowl LV, when the Buccaneers became the first team to reach the Super Bowl that their own stadium hosted, the Buccaneers were designated the home team as per AFC-NFC rotation and elected to wear their white jerseys, having previously won both their divisional and championship post-season games on the road in white jerseys.[199] White-shirted teams have won 37 of 58 Super Bowls to date (approximately 64%). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Packers against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, the Eagles against the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, the Chiefs against the 49ers in Super Bowls LIV and LVIII, and the Eagles against the Chiefs in LIX.[200] Since Super Bowl XXXIX, teams in white jerseys have won 16 of the last 20 Super Bowls.

The 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1955 throwback uniform in Super Bowl XXIX, which for that year was their regular home jersey. The Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII wore their royal blue and yellow uniforms, which was a throwback uniform but then turned into their primary colors over the navy blue and metallic gold uniform, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game.[201] No team has yet worn a third jersey or Color Rush uniform for the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[202]

Sixteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.

Note: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (or will be played[ˇ]; future games are denoted through italics) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been.

A total of 27 different stadiums have either hosted, or are scheduled to host, a Super Bowl, with 14 of the stadiums having hosted, or are scheduled to host, more than one Super Bowl. Seven of the Super Bowl hosting stadiums have been demolished.

The years listed in the table below are the years the game was actually played (will be played[ˇ]) rather than the NFL season it concluded.

The Super Bowl has not yet been played in any region that lacked an NFL or AFL franchise at the time the game was played.[204]

San Diego is the only metropolitan area as of 2021 that has hosted past Super Bowls, but does not currently have an NFL franchise: San Diego Stadium hosted three Super Bowls before their NFL franchise relocated to Los Angeles. Also, London, England, has occasionally been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl in the near future.[205] Wembley Stadium has hosted several NFL games as part of the NFL International Series and is specifically designed for large, individual events, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions.[206][207][208][209]

Time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30 p.m. EST start would result in the game beginning at 11:30 p.m. local time in London: this is an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports, while the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15 p.m. local time.[209]

Although bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LIX, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LXII in 2028.[210]

Eight stadiums that hosted at least one Super Bowl no longer exist:

The NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms ""NFL"", ""Super Bowl"", and ""Super Bowl Sunday"".[211] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it  as ""The Big Game"", or other generic descriptions.[212][213] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying ""it would be super ... to have a bowl ... of Planters nuts while watching the big game!"" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the ""Superb Owl"". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for ""Superb Owl"".[214] Another entity has a service mark for ""Superb Owl"".[215]

The NFL claims that the use of the phrase ""Super Bowl"" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that ""promote a message"", while non-sporting event venues are also prohibited to show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches.[216] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that ""any use is prohibited"", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[216] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 ""to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games"", and ""for other purposes"".[217]

In 2004, the NFL started issuing cease-and-desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. ""Super Bowl"" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Las Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as ""Big Game Parties"".[218][219][220]

In 2006, the NFL made an attempt to trademark ""The Big Game"" as well; however, it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public relations opposition to the move, mostly from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley and their fans, as the Stanford Cardinal football and California Golden Bears football teams compete in the Big Game, which has been played since 1892 (28 years before the formation of the NFL and 75 years before Super Bowl I).[221] Additionally, the Mega Millions lottery game was known as The Big Game (then The Big Game Mega Millions) from 1996 to 2002.[222]

The game, played on the second Sunday in February since 2022, awards the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the winning team. Initially called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, it was renamed Super Bowl III in 1969. The event emerged from a merger between the NFL and AFL, with games featuring top teams from each conference. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots hold six titles each, while Tom Brady has seven wins as a player. The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched sporting events globally, with high viewership leading to expensive commercial airtime and elaborate halftime shows featuring top artists. Historically held in warm climates or domed stadiums, recent exceptions include MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Hosting rights are awarded based on infrastructure and community investment. Notably, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams won Super Bowls at their home stadiums in consecutive years.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the brainstorming session.\n- Quick greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Encouragement for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of the Super Bowl\nTLDR: Discussing the origins and evolution of the Super Bowl.\n- Sports Historian shares key historical milestones\n- Anecdotes about early Super Bowls\n- Open floor for additional historical insights"", ""Scene 3: Game Strategies and Player Performances\nTLDR: Analyzing game strategies, player performances, and team dynamics.\n- Sports Analyst breaks down notable games and strategies\n- Discussion on standout players like Tom Brady\n- Participants share personal favorite moments"", ""Scene 4: Commercial Impact and Marketing Strategies\nTLDR: Exploring the commercial aspects of the Super Bowl.\n- Marketing Specialist discusses advertising trends and audience engagement\n- Examples of successful ad campaigns\n- Open discussion on memorable commercials"", ""Scene 5: Logistics of Hosting the Super Bowl\nTLDR: Insights into planning and executing a large-scale event like the Super Bowl.\n- Event Coordinator outlines logistical challenges and solutions\n- Discussion on recent hosting cities and their impact\n- Participants share thoughts on potential future hosts"", ""Scene 6: Media Coverage and Public Reception\nTLDR: Examining how media covers the Super Bowl and its public reception.\n- Sports Journalist provides analysis on media trends over the years\n- Discussion on social media's role in modern coverage\n- Participants share memorable media moments"", ""Scene 7: Cultural Impact and Fan Experience\nTLDR: Understanding the cultural significance of the Super Bowl from a fan's perspective.\n- Sports Fan shares personal experiences attending or watching games\n- Discussion on traditions, halftime shows, and fan culture\n- Open floor for participants to share their own experiences"", ""Scene 8: Idea Generation Session \nTLDR: Collaborative brainstorming to generate new ideas related to various aspects of the Super Bowl. \n - Encourage creative thinking without judgment \n - List potential ideas from each participant \n - Prioritize concepts for further exploration"", ""Scene 9: Wrap-Up & Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarizing key points discussed during session & outlining next steps. \n - Recap main ideas generated \n - Assign follow-up tasks if necessary \n - Thank everyone for their participation""]",">>Event Coordinator: Alright, everyone, welcome! Let's get started with our brainstorming session. Our main objectives today are to outline the key elements for hosting a successful Super Bowl and to identify potential challenges we might face. Sound good?

>>Participants: (Nodding) Yes, sounds great!

>>Sports Historian: The Super Bowl has come a long way since it started in 1967. Back then, it was just about finding the best team between the NFL and AFL.

>>Marketing Specialist: Exactly! And now it's not just about the game; it's a prime opportunity for brands to engage with millions of viewers. Companies are willing to spend up to $7 million for a 30-second spot!

>>Sports Analyst: Yeah, those numbers are wild. But let's not forget what happens on the field—the game plans and player performances are what truly captivate the audience.

>>Event Coordinator: Okay, let's focus on logistical challenges next. We need to ensure smooth transportation for thousands of fans, coordinate security measures, and manage media personnel influx. Any thoughts on transportation logistics?

>>Sports Journalist: From a media perspective, coverage has evolved just as much as the event itself. Networks compete for exclusive rights and craft narratives that captivate millions. How do we ensure comprehensive and engaging coverage?

>>Sports Fan: Isn't it amazing how people throw parties and enjoy incredible halftime shows? Even those commercials are legendary.

>>Marketing Specialist: Right! The Super Bowl's commercial impact isn't just about ads during the game—it's also about pre-game hype and post-game discussions that keep brands in the spotlight for weeks.

>>Event Coordinator: Great points! So let's make sure we cover all bases—transportation logistics, security measures...

>>Sports Analyst: ...and don't forget about coordinating media personnel—each aspect needs careful planning. 
 >>Sports Historian: You know, it's interesting how the Super Bowl started with the NFL and AFL merger back in 1966. The first game wasn't even called the Super Bowl; it was the AFL-NFL World Championship Game.

>>Marketing Specialist: Yeah, and now companies spend millions on ads because they know they'll reach a huge audience. It's like hitting the marketing jackpot!

>>Sports Analyst: When you look at the numbers, it's clear that the Super Bowl's evolution isn't just about the game itself but also how teams have adapted their strategies over time. For instance, um, teams like the Patriots and Steelers dominating different eras shows how critical it is to stay ahead of strategic trends.

>>Sports Historian: Right, those early games were so different from today. The halftime shows had college marching bands instead of big-name performers. And when the AFL won in Super Bowl III, it really changed how people saw both leagues.

>>Sports Journalist: Absolutely! Media coverage has come a long way too. From simple broadcasts to multi-platform extravaganzas, networks are always trying to outdo each other with exclusive rights and engaging stories.

>>Sports Fan: Isn't it amazing how it's become such a cultural phenomenon? It's not just about football anymore—it's about halftime shows, commercials, even food! Can you believe how much people spend on snacks alone?

>>Sports Historian: Exactly! Back then, it was all about the game itself; now it's a full-blown cultural event with major performances by top artists during halftime and commercials that are as anticipated as the game!

>>Marketing Specialist: And those commercials have become cultural phenomena in their own right. Brands aren't just selling products; they're creating mini-movies that people talk about for days afterward.

>>Event Coordinator: Speaking of planning these big events, ensuring smooth transportation and security measures has become a massive task. It takes meticulous planning to pull off something this big.

>>Sports Journalist: Definitely! And social media plays a huge role now too. Networks create engaging content across multiple platforms to keep audiences hooked before, during, and after the game.

>>Sports Fan: Yeah! And don't forget about fan experiences at home or at parties—it’s all part of what makes this event so special every year! 
 >>Sports Analyst: When you look at the numbers, Tom Brady's performance in the Super Bowl is legendary. Seven wins and ten appearances—his ability to read defenses and execute under pressure is unparalleled. It's like watching a master at work.

>>Sports Historian: Absolutely, his knack for making split-second decisions sets him apart. It reminds me of the greats from back in the day. Watching him play is like seeing a chess grandmaster anticipate every move.

>>Marketing Specialist: The commercial impact of Brady's performances can't be overstated. His presence boosts viewership and drives up advertising rates significantly. Brands pay top dollar for a spot during his games because millions tune in to watch him play.

>>Event Coordinator: Hosting the Super Bowl is a massive undertaking. Coordinating transportation for thousands of fans, ensuring top-notch security—every detail needs meticulous planning. In the end, it’s all about getting things done right.

>>Sports Fan: You know, the fan experience during the Super Bowl is incredible! It's not just about the game but everything around it—the halftime show, commercials, even the food we eat! The atmosphere adds so much excitement—it’s part of what makes it special each year!

>>Sports Journalist: The media coverage of Brady's Super Bowl performances has been phenomenal. The narratives crafted around his career have elevated his status and driven viewership numbers through the roof. Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and engagement.

>>Sports Analyst: Breaking down Brady's performance isn't just about physical skills but also mental acuity. His ability to make adjustments on the fly truly sets him apart.

>>Event Coordinator: And let's not forget logistics—ensuring smooth operations from start to finish requires detailed planning months in advance. From stadium setup to fan amenities, every aspect needs attention. 
 >>Marketing Specialist: You know, the Super Bowl commercials are like the cherry on top of this massive event. Brands spend millions for those 30-second spots because they know they're reaching an audience that's fully engaged. Remember Doritos' ""Crash the Super Bowl"" campaign? It wasn't just a commercial; it was a cultural moment.

>>Sports Historian: Absolutely, the Super Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon in their own right. Back in the day, it was just about selling products, but now it's about creating memorable moments that people talk about for years. Like Apple's '1984' ad—it wasn't just an ad; it was a statement.

>>Sports Analyst: Yeah, and when you look at the numbers, these commercials aren't just about entertainment; they're strategic investments. Brands really look at who’s watching and craft ads that resonate deeply with them. For instance, Old Spice's ""The Man Your Man Could Smell Like"" wasn't just funny; it hit all the right notes with its target audience.

>>Event Coordinator: Alright, let's break it down step by step. The logistics of executing these commercials aren't just about creativity. We need to coordinate with multiple stakeholders, ensure timely delivery of materials, and manage any last-minute changes. At the end of the day, it's all about execution.

>>Sports Journalist: And don't forget how crucial media coverage is! It's not just about airing them; it's about creating a narrative that sticks around long after the game. For example, Doritos' campaign didn't go viral just because it was funny; media outlets played a big role in amplifying its reach.

>>Sports Fan: Hey, you know what's amazing? These commercials have become a huge part of the Super Bowl experience! It's not just about the game anymore; it's like a mini film festival! People actually look forward to these ads as much as the touchdowns!

>>Marketing Specialist: Exactly! The real magic happens when these commercials tap into what people are feeling at that moment. Take Old Spice again—it's not just about humor; it's about creating something memorable that viewers connect with emotionally.

>>Sports Historian: Well said! The evolution of Super Bowl commercials is fascinating. They used to be straightforward product pitches but now they’re like mini-movies everyone eagerly anticipates.

>>Sports Analyst: So true! And brands use data to back up their strategies—like with Old Spice—they analyze who’s watching and what resonates most to make sure their ads hit home.

>>Event Coordinator: And don’t forget logistics! Coordinating everything from production schedules to last-minute changes is no small feat. It’s all hands on deck to make sure everything runs smoothly and on time.

>>Sports Journalist: Right! And then there’s how media covers these ads post-game—it’s almost as important as airing them during halftime itself! Strategic coverage can amplify their impact significantly.

>>Sports Fan: Yeah! I mean, people throw parties just to watch these commercials now! Isn't that wild? It's like everyone’s waiting for those iconic moments every year! 
 >>Event Coordinator: Alright, let's break it down step by step. When you look at the logistics of hosting the Super Bowl, it's a massive undertaking. We're talking about coordinating transportation for thousands of fans, ensuring top-notch security, and managing media coverage seamlessly.

>>Sports Historian: You know, back in the day, hosting the Super Bowl was a simpler affair. But as the event grew into a cultural phenomenon, so did the logistical challenges. Take Miami, for instance—it's hosted the game eleven times! Each time, they had to innovate and adapt to handle everything from fan transportation to media coverage.

>>Sports Analyst: Yeah, exactly! And when you look at recent hosts like Los Angeles or Houston, they've also had to bring their A-game in terms of planning and execution. I'm curious how these cities compare in terms of logistical efficiency?

>>Sports Journalist: Well, media coverage plays a crucial role in the success of hosting the Super Bowl. It's not just about broadcasting the game itself but also managing pre-game shows, halftime performances, and post-game analysis. Cities like Los Angeles have had to ensure seamless coordination with multiple media outlets to provide comprehensive coverage that meets high viewer expectations.

>>Sports Historian: The evolution of hosting cities is fascinating. Take Los Angeles—they hosted Super Bowl LVI in their new SoFi Stadium with its state-of-the-art facilities. It really set a new standard for future hosts.

>>Marketing Specialist: The commercial impact of hosting the Super Bowl is massive. Cities like Houston have leveraged their hosting duties to boost local businesses and tourism significantly. The ripple effect on the economy is just incredible.

>>Sports Fan: Wow! It's amazing how these cities transform during Super Bowl week! The energy is just off the charts!

>>Event Coordinator: Absolutely! And let's not forget about security measures—ensuring everyone's safety while maintaining an enjoyable atmosphere is no small feat.

>>Sports Analyst: So true. And when you consider recent innovations by host cities with their state-of-the-art stadiums... How do these innovations impact both fan experience and local economy?

>>Marketing Specialist: Well yeah! These innovations definitely enhance fan experience while driving economic growth through increased tourism and business opportunities.

>>Sports Journalist: From a media perspective... seamless coordination with multiple outlets ensures comprehensive coverage that meets high viewer expectations. 
 >>Sports Historian: The evolution of media coverage for the Super Bowl is fascinating. Back in the day, it was all about TV broadcasts and newspapers. Now, with social media, every moment is shared instantly, creating a whole new level of fan engagement.

>>Marketing Specialist: Absolutely! Brands are willing to shell out millions for a 30-second spot because they know they're reaching an audience of over 100 million viewers. It's not just about the game; it's about making ads that people remember long after the final whistle.

>>Sports Analyst: When you look at the numbers, it's clear that social media has revolutionized Super Bowl coverage. The real-time updates and fan interactions create a dynamic environment that traditional media simply can't match.

>>Sports Journalist: Yeah, and it's not just about real-time updates; it's about creating a narrative that engages fans on multiple levels. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram have made every moment shareable, turning viewers into active participants.

>>Sports Fan: Isn't it amazing how social media has made the Super Bowl a global event? Fans from all over the world can share their excitement in real-time! It's like we're all part of one big virtual stadium!

>>Event Coordinator: Given how important social media has become, let's discuss how we manage these elements during the event. Coordinating live broadcasts, managing social media updates, and ensuring seamless communication between all parties involved is no small feat.

>>Sports Historian: Indeed! This shift has also changed how we consume sports history itself—everything's documented instantly online now!

>>Marketing Specialist: And that's why brands invest so heavily in Super Bowl ads. They know they're not just buying airtime; they're joining in on something everyone talks about. Plus, influencer marketing plays such a huge role nowadays by sharing their experiences live from events—it adds another layer of engagement altogether!

>>Sports Analyst: Right! And if you look at how quickly information spreads now compared to traditional methods... I mean, it's night and day. Real-time updates keep everyone engaged throughout the entire event.

>>Sports Journalist: Plus, there's this whole aspect of user-generated content now. Fans are creating their own narratives around what happens during the game—memes, reactions—you name it!

>>Sports Fan: Yeah! Remember last year when that halftime show meme went viral? It was everywhere within minutes!

>>Event Coordinator: That's exactly what makes planning so crucial. We need to ensure everything runs smoothly across all platforms—TV broadcasts, online streams—and handle any unexpected issues promptly. 
 >>Sports Fan: Hey, you know what's amazing? The way fans come together for the Super Bowl! It's like a national holiday. I remember last year, my friends and I had this huge party with all the classic snacks—nachos, wings, you name it. And those halftime shows? Wow! They bring everyone to their feet!

>>Sports Historian: Yeah, the Super Bowl's become way more than just a game; it's like this huge cultural thing now. Back in the day, it was all about football, but now it's an event that brings people together from all walks of life. The halftime shows have become legendary over time.

>>Marketing Specialist: Absolutely! And those commercials are a massive part of the experience too. Brands spend millions on these ads because they know they're reaching an audience that's fully engaged. It's not just about selling products; it's about creating memorable moments that people talk about for years. Remember the '1984' Apple ad? That was a game-changer!

>>Sports Analyst: So, when you look at the numbers—

>>Event Coordinator (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here, but speaking of numbers, did anyone catch how much revenue was generated from last year's ads alone?

>>Marketing Specialist: Oh yeah! It was astronomical—over $500 million if I'm not mistaken.

>>Sports Analyst: Exactly! So when you look at those numbers, it's clear that the Super Bowl's impact goes way beyond just the game itself. The halftime shows and commercials have become integral parts of the experience and often generate as much buzz as the game itself.

>>(laughter)

>>Event Coordinator (laughing): Sorry for interrupting earlier!

>>(more laughter)

>>Sports Analyst (smiling): No worries! As I was saying earlier about those numbers...it's interesting how these elements contribute to a shared national moment.

>>Sports Historian: You know what else is fascinating? How different things were back in the early days of the Super Bowl. It used to be so focused on just football. Now you've got these huge spectacles with halftime shows and commercials that people look forward to as much as—or even more than—the game itself.

>>(nodding)

>>Sports Fan: Totally! My favorite memory has to be watching Prince perform in the rain during halftime—it was epic! 
 >>Marketing Specialist: You know, the Super Bowl commercials are like the crown jewels of advertising. Brands go all out to create memorable moments that stick with viewers long after the game. How about we brainstorm ways to incorporate significant historical moments into the halftime show? Maybe a tribute to legendary players or iconic games?

>>Sports Historian: Definitely! The Super Bowl has always been more than just a game. What if we highlight iconic moments from past Super Bowls during the halftime show? We could even bring back legendary players for a special segment.

>>Sports Analyst: Hmm, interesting idea. What if we also incorporate advanced analytics into the halftime show? We could use real-time data to highlight key plays and player performances from the first half, creating an interactive experience for fans both in the stadium and at home. This could be a game-changer in terms of engagement.

>>Event Coordinator: Those are fantastic ideas for content. Now, let's think about how we can manage the logistics like stage setup and security, but let's focus on brainstorming creative ideas first.

>>Sports Fan: That sounds really cool! Seeing those old-school ads again would be awesome.

>>Marketing Specialist: That's a great point! Engaging fans directly can really enhance their experience. Maybe we can integrate social media interactions too—like live tweets using a specific hashtag or Instagram posts being displayed during breaks.

>>Sports Historian: Exactly! And speaking of history, how about featuring some classic Super Bowl ads as part of a nostalgic segment? It would remind people of those unforgettable moments while tying into our theme of historical significance.

>>Sports Analyst: I love that idea! But do you think we have enough time to analyze those ads during the halftime show?

>>Event Coordinator: Good thinking! We'll need to ensure there's enough time allocated for these segments without disrupting the flow of events.

>>Sports Fan: Yeah, totally makes sense! And you know what would be awesome? If they had fan shout-outs or something during halftime. Like, showing fans' reactions live on screen or even having some kind of interactive element where fans can participate from home.

>>Marketing Specialist: Right? It's all about creating memorable experiences that resonate with viewers long after the event is over.
 
>>Sports Historian: Absolutely! And by incorporating these elements thoughtfully, we'll not only entertain but also educate our audience on how far we've come since those early days. 
 >>Event Coordinator: Alright, let's break it down step by step. We've covered a lot of ground today, from the historical evolution to the logistical challenges and marketing impacts. So, our next steps are clear: finalize transportation logistics, coordinate with security teams, and ensure seamless media coverage.

>>Marketing Specialist: Absolutely! You know, the Super Bowl commercials are not just ads; they're cultural events. Brands invest millions because they know the audience engagement is unparalleled. It's really about making ads that people remember long after the game.

>>Sports Historian: Well, you see, the Super Bowl has truly evolved into a cultural phenomenon. It started as just a game in 1967 but now it's an entire experience that includes commercials, halftime shows, and fan engagement.

>>Sports Analyst: Right. When you look at the numbers, it's clear that this evolution into a cultural phenomenon has been driven by more than just the game itself. Using real-time data improves both fan experience and gives valuable insights for teams and advertisers.

>>Sports Journalist: Yeah...the media coverage of the Super Bowl has evolved tremendously too. From simple broadcasts to multi-platform experiences—it's fascinating how networks compete for exclusive rights and create engaging narratives that captivate millions.

>>Sports Fan: Totally! As a fan, I think incorporating classic ads during nostalgic segments would engage viewers effectively.

>>Event Coordinator: Exactly! So let's make sure we incorporate all these elements effectively. Our next steps should include finalizing transportation logistics and coordinating with security teams to ensure everything runs smoothly on game day.

>>Marketing Specialist: And don't forget about social media engagement! We need to plan out how we'll interact with fans online during both pre-game hype and post-game discussions.

>>Sports Historian: Highlighting significant historical moments will add depth to our content—educating fans while entertaining them.

>>Sports Analyst: Using real-time data can enhance this experience even further by providing live insights during key plays or player performances.

>>Sports Journalist: We should document all these ideas so we can refer back to them in future planning sessions.

>>Event Coordinator: Great points everyone! Let's assign follow-up tasks now so we're all on track for our next meeting. Thanks everyone! Let’s get those tasks done before our next meet."
