Abstract Expressionism,"Abstract expressionism in the United States emerged as a distinct art movement in the immediate aftermath of World War II and gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s, a shift from the American social realism of the 1930s influenced by the Great Depression and Mexican muralists.[1][2] The term was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates. Key figures in the New York School, which was the center of this movement, included such artists as Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Norman Lewis, Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Theodoros Stamos and Lee Krasner among others.

The movement was not limited to painting but included influential collagists and sculptors, such as David Smith, Louise Nevelson, and others. Abstract expressionism was notably influenced by the spontaneous and subconscious creation methods of Surrealist artists like André Masson and Max Ernst. Artists associated with the movement combined the emotional intensity of German Expressionism with the radical visual vocabularies of European avant-garde schools like Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism.

Abstract expressionism was seen as rebellious and idiosyncratic, encompassing various artistic styles, and was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the Western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Contemporary art critics played a significant role in its development. Critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg promoted the work of artists associated with abstract expressionism, in particular Jackson Pollock, through their writings. Rosenberg's concept of the canvas as an ""arena in which to act"" was pivotal in defining the approach of action painters. The cultural reign of abstract expressionism in the United States had diminished by the early 1960s, while the subsequent rejection of the abstract Expressionist emphasis on individualism led to the development of such movements as Pop art and Minimalism.[3] Throughout the second half of the 20th century, influence of AbEx can be seen in diverse movements in the U.S. and Europe, including Tachisme and Neo-expressionism, among others.

The term ""abstract expressionism"" is believed to have first been used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm in reference to German Expressionism. Alfred Barr used this term in 1929 to describe works by Wassily Kandinsky.[4] The term was used in the United States in 1946 by Robert Coates in his review of 18 Hans Hofmann paintings.[5][6]

Technically, an important predecessor is Surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock's dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of André Masson, Max Ernst, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist Wolfgang Paalen in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine DYN. Paalen considered ideas of quantum mechanics, as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay Totem Art (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.[7] Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of ""the men in the new movement"". Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, Gorky and others.  Robert Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.[8] Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist Mark Tobey, especially his ""white writing"" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the ""all-over"" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.[9] In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist Jay Meuser, who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting Mare Nostrum, ""It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples."" Pollock's energetic ""action paintings"", with their ""busy"" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque Women series of Willem de Kooning's figurative paintings and the rectangles of color in Rothko's Color Field paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.


Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as Wassily Kandinsky. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as Paul Klee, Kandinsky, Emma Kunz, and later on Rothko, Newman, and Agnes Martin, abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.[10]
Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American social realism had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the Great Depression, but also by the Mexican muralists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during the war and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as The Art of This Century Gallery. The post-war McCarthy era was a time of artistic censorship in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally abstract then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.[11]

While the movement is closely associated with painting, collagist Anne Ryan and certain sculptors in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.[12] David Smith, and his wife Dorothy Dehner, Herbert Ferber, Isamu Noguchi, Ibram Lassaw, Theodore Roszak, Phillip Pavia, Mary Callery, Richard Stankiewicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists David Hare, John Chamberlain, James Rosati, Mark di Suvero, and sculptors Richard Lippold, Raoul Hague, George Rickey, Reuben Nakian, and even Tony Smith, Seymour Lipton, Joseph Cornell, and several others[13] were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the Ninth Street Show,[13] a famous exhibition curated by Leo Castelli on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the New York School of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including Frank O'Hara and photographers such as Aaron Siskind and Fred McDarrah, (whose book The Artist's World in Pictures documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably Robert Frank—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the epicenters of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.
In the 1940s there were not only few galleries (The Art of This Century, Pierre Matisse Gallery, Julien Levy Gallery and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, who functioned as critics as well.

While the New York avant-garde was still relatively unknown by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: Clement Greenberg advocated Jackson Pollock and the color field painters like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Hans Hofmann; Harold Rosenberg seemed to prefer the action painters such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, as well as the seminal paintings of Arshile Gorky; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ARTnews, championed Willem de Kooning.

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as ""followers""[15] or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, Mark Tobey became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Venice Biennale.[16]

Barnett Newman, a late member of the Uptown Group, wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: ""We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.""[17] Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, ""Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.""[18]

Strangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: Clement Greenberg. As long-time art critic for the Partisan Review and The Nation, he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist Robert Motherwell joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via Cubism and Cézanne to Monet, in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.[19]

Pollock's work has always polarised critics. Rosenberg spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which ""what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event"". ""The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral.""[20]

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was The New York Times art critic John Canaday. Meyer Schapiro and Leo Steinberg along with Greenberg and Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics Michael Fried, Rosalind Krauss, and Robert Hughes added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

During the period leading up to and during World War II, modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from Varian Fry) were Hans Namuth, Yves Tanguy, Kay Sage, Max Ernst, Jimmy Ernst, Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Castelli, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, Roberto Matta, André Breton, Marc Chagall, Jacques Lipchitz, Fernand Léger, and Piet Mondrian. A few artists, notably Picasso, Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. Post-war Europe saw the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada, and the works of Matisse. Also in Europe, Art brut,[21] and Lyrical Abstraction or Tachisme (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. Serge Poliakoff, Nicolas de Staël, Georges Mathieu, Vieira da Silva, Jean Dubuffet, Yves Klein, Pierre Soulages and Jean Messagier, among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.[22] In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called abstract expressionists.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Matisse, Picasso, Surrealism, Miró, Cubism, Fauvism, and early Modernism via eminent educators in the United States, including Hans Hofmann from Germany and John D. Graham from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of Gorky, de Kooning, Pollock, and Richard Pousette-Dart among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as lyrical abstraction[24][25][26][27][28] was a ""new language.[24] He ""lit the way for two generations of American artists"".[24] The painterly spontaneity of mature works such as The Liver is the Cock's Comb, The Betrothal II, and One Year the Milkweed immediately prefigured Abstract expressionism, and leaders in the New York School have acknowledged Gorky's considerable influence. The early work of Hyman Bloom was also influential.[29] American artists also benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst, and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim's gallery The Art of This Century, as well as other factors. Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was Clement Greenberg, who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was Lee Krasner, who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.[30]

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all Contemporary art that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as Navajo sand paintings, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,[31] Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Pollock, de Kooning, Franz Kline, Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Richard Pousette-Dart, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos, and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.  The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, Conceptual art, and the feminist art movement can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as Linda Nochlin,[32] Griselda Pollock[33] and Catherine de Zegher[34] critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the Charles Egan Gallery,[35] the Sidney Janis Gallery,[36] the Betty Parsons Gallery,[37] the Kootz Gallery,[38] the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, the Stable Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the Tenth Street galleries exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms action painting and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French tachisme.

The term was coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952[39] and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was ""an arena in which to act"". While abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like Clement Greenberg, focused on their works' ""objectness"". To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' existential struggle.

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the ""action"" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, painterly gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the unconscious part of the psyche assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed unconscious manifestation of the act of pure creation.[40]

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic action paintings, with their ""busy"" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to De Kooning's violent and grotesque Women series. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian Meyer Schapiro saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, Woman III and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at East Hampton, de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on Woman I by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.[41] The Woman series are decidedly figurative paintings.

Another important artist is Franz Kline.[42][43] As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an ""action painter"" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brushstrokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting Number 2 (1954).[44][45][46]

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters such as Kline (in his black and white paintings), Pollock, Mark Tobey and Cy Twombly, who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the Collective unconscious.[47][48] Robert Motherwell in his Elegy to the Spanish Republic series painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.[49][50]

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably de Kooning, Gorky, Norman Bluhm, Joan Mitchell, and James Brooks, used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to Lyrical Abstraction that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.[51]

Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in Mark Rothko's work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what Clement Greenberg termed the Color field direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and Robert Motherwell can be comfortably described as practitioners of Action painting and Color field painting. In the 1940s Richard Pousette-Dart's tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of Gottlieb, and Pollock in that decade as well.

Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Rothko, Still, Newman, Motherwell, Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt and several series of paintings by Joan Miró. Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Motherwell, Still, Rothko, Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, and especially Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman, whose masterpiece Vir heroicus sublimis is in the collection of MoMA, used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general, these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbols and signs as a replacement of imagery.[52] Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as Pollock and de Kooning, the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However, Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the New York School, and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an ""all-over"" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the arena became a credo of Action painting, while the integrity of the picture plane became a credo of the Color field painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including Alfred Leslie, Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell, Helen Frankenthaler, Cy Twombly, Milton Resnick, Michael Goldberg, Norman Bluhm, Grace Hartigan, Friedel Dzubas, and Robert Goodnough among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with Action Painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly touch and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale Water Lilies of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Art critics such as Michael Fried, Greenberg and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his drip paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements. They note that these works often read as vast complexes of similarly-valued paint skeins and all-over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized Monets which are similarly constructed of close-valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as fields of color and drawing. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic drip painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed Number 12, 1952, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection.[53]

While Arshile Gorky is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a surrealist, he was also one of the first painters of the New York School who used the technique of staining. Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as grounds. In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is James Brooks. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his oil paint in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, Sam Francis' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, Action painting and Color Field painting.

Having seen Pollock's 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, Frankenthaler began to produce stain paintings in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is Mountains and Sea. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.[54] Frankenthaler also studied with Hans Hofmann.

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in The Gate, 1959–1960. He was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the US. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. As a young artist in pre-First World War Paris, Hofmann worked with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Picasso and Matisse. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland were both profoundly influenced by Helen Frankenthaler's stain paintings after visiting her studio in New York City. Returning to Washington, DC., they began to produce the major works that created the color field movement in the late 1950s.[55]

In 1972 then Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler said:

Clement Greenberg included the work of both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem was the first to see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.[56][57]
In abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the Hard-edge painting exemplified by John McLaughlin, emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of Geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles. Greenberg became the voice of Post-painterly abstraction; by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. Color field painting, Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction[58] emerged as radical new directions.

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the CIA, who saw it as representative of the US as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the socialist realist styles prevalent in communist nations and the dominance of the European art markets.[59] The book by Frances Stonor Saunders,[citation needed] The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters,[60] (published in the UK as Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War) details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of cultural imperialism via the Congress for Cultural Freedom from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series Elegy to the Spanish Republic addressed some of those political issues. Tom Braden, founding chief of the CIA's International Organizations Division (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art said in an interview, ""I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.""[61]

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, called Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War, asserts that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it, is false or decontextualized.[62] Other books on the subject include Art in the Cold War, by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and Pollock and After, edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group Les Automatistes, helped introduce a related style of abstract impressionism to the Parisian art world from 1949. Michel Tapié's groundbreaking book, Un Art Autre (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial effect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded Tachisme, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Neo-expressionism, and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting (Frank Stella, Robert Indiana and others) and Pop artists, notably Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. Minimalism was exemplified by artists such as Donald Judd, Robert Mangold and Agnes Martin.

However, many painters, such as Jules Olitski, Joan Mitchell and Antoni Tàpies continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as lyrical abstraction, neo-expressionist and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as Pop Art. This also helped to make New York into a cultural and artistic hub.[63]

Abstract Expressionists value the organism over the static whole, becoming over being, expression over perfection, vitality over finish, fluctuation over repose, feeling over formulation, the unknown over the known, the veiled over the clear, the individual over society and the inner over the outer.[64]

It was noted that this movement marked a departure from American social realism, gaining prominence in the 1950s with key figures like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning. The influence of Surrealist techniques and European avant-garde movements was highlighted. The movement's rebellious nature and its role in establishing New York as a new art center were discussed. Critics such as Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg played significant roles in promoting Abstract Expressionism. The decline of the movement by the early 1960s led to the rise of Pop Art and Minimalism. Additionally, it was acknowledged that while initially centered around painting, Abstract Expressionism also included notable sculptors and collagists. The meeting concluded with an acknowledgment of the lasting influence of Abstract Expressionism on subsequent art movements both in the U.S. and Europe.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants and setting the tone for the meeting.\n- Brief welcome by the facilitator\n- Quick round of greetings\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Abstract Expressionism\nTLDR: Discussing the emergence and impact of Abstract Expressionism post-WWII.\n- Art Historian provides a historical overview\n- Discussion on key figures like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning\n- Influence of Surrealist techniques and European avant-garde movements"", ""Scene 3: Practical Application in Contemporary Art\nTLDR: Exploring how Abstract Expressionism influences current art practices.\n- Contemporary Artist shares personal experiences and anecdotes\n- Discussion on practical applications in modern art\n- Participants share their perspectives on the movement's relevance today"", ""Scene 4: Analytical Evaluation by Art Critic\nTLDR: Critical analysis of Abstract Expressionism's significance and decline.\n- Art Critic evaluates the movement's impact and critiques its elements\n- Discussion on critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg\n- Debate on reasons for the movement's decline by early 1960s"", ""Scene 5: Curatorial Perspective on Collection Development\nTLDR: Insights into how museums curate collections related to Abstract Expressionism.\n- Museum Curator discusses collection strategies and challenges\n- Examples of notable exhibitions or acquisitions\n- Collaborative discussion on future directions for curating such art"", ""Scene 6: Open Floor for Spontaneous Contributions\nTLDR: Allowing participants to bring up unplanned topics or insights.\n- Open floor for any additional thoughts or questions from participants\n- Sharing personal experiences or stories related to Abstract Expressionism"", ""Scene 7: Weighing Pros and Cons; Reaching Consensus\nTLDR: Evaluating options, weighing pros and cons, aiming for a decision.\n- Facilitator summarizes key points discussed so far\n- Group discussion to weigh pros and cons of different viewpoints presented \n - Attempt to reach a consensus or make a definitive decision"", ""Scene 8: Action Items and Responsibilities Assignment \n TLDR : Finalizing decisions made during the meeting with clear action items. \n - Facilitator outlines agreed-upon actions \n - Assign responsibilities to specific participants \n - Set deadlines or follow-up dates"", ""Scene 9 : Closing Remarks \\ n TLDR : Wrapping up the meeting with final thoughts .\\ n - Participants share any last comments or reflections\\ n - Facilitator thanks everyone for their contributions\\ n - Meeting adjourned""]",">>Museum Curator: Good morning, everyone. It's great to see you all here today. As you know, our main goal for this meeting is to discuss the upcoming exhibition and how we can best represent the diverse facets of abstract expressionism.

>>Art Historian: Good morning. I'm looking forward to our discussion. The historical context of abstract expressionism is crucial, especially considering its emergence post-World War II. This movement wasn't just about artistic innovation but also reflected significant cultural and political shifts.

>>Contemporary Artist: Hey everyone! I'm really excited about today's discussion. From an artist's perspective, abstract expressionism allows us to explore our emotions in unique ways through our work.

>>Art Critic: Morning all. While representing abstract expressionism is important, we should also challenge and expand its conventional boundaries by evaluating both the emotional impact and technical execution within each piece.

>>Museum Curator: Absolutely, we need to look at both history and what's relevant today to make sure our exhibition really connects with people.

>>Art Historian: Exactly. Figures like Pollock and Rothko were pivotal, but we should also consider lesser-known artists who contributed significantly to the movement.

>>Contemporary Artist: Honestly, what I find fascinating is how each artist's unique approach leads to such diverse expressions within abstract expressionism. It's amazing how it allows us to explore raw emotions through practical application in art practices.

>>Art Critic: True, but let's not forget that while exploring these raw emotions, we must also critically assess how these works challenge traditional forms and innovate technically. Don't you think?

>>Museum Curator: Well said. Balancing emotional depth with technical innovation will be key in curating this exhibition effectively. 
 >>Art Historian: You know, after World War II, Abstract Expressionism really took off because artists were reacting to all that trauma and disillusionment from the war. New York City became this new hub of artistic innovation.

>>Contemporary Artist: Yeah, what I find fascinating is how artists like Pollock and Rothko weren't just painting; they were pouring their souls onto the canvas. It was more than just art—it was therapy.

>>Art Critic: However, it's essential to recognize that the emotional intensity in Abstract Expressionism wasn't just a reaction to post-war trauma but also a deliberate move away from earlier styles like figurative and social realism of the 1930s. They wanted to explore the inner psyche rather than external realities.

>>Art Historian: Notably, Surrealist techniques had a big influence here—what do you think about how André Masson’s methods impacted Pollock?

>>Contemporary Artist: To be fair, these artists embraced spontaneity in such an amazing way! Pollock's drip technique wasn't just about splattering paint; it was like a dance on canvas. And Rothko's color fields? They pull you into this meditative state.

>>Museum Curator: From a curatorial perspective, we aim to achieve a comprehensive representation of the movement's evolution. This includes not only well-known figures like Pollock and Rothko but also those who contributed significantly yet remain underrepresented, such as Norman Lewis and Lee Krasner. Their inclusion provides a richer narrative.

>>Art Historian: Absolutely! It's crucial to acknowledge that Abstract Expressionism was not just reactionary but also a confluence of various influences. Techniques borrowed from Surrealism and European avant-garde were instrumental in shaping its unique identity.

>>Contemporary Artist: Honestly, seeing how these artists used their techniques to express raw emotion is incredible!

>>Art Critic: Indeed! The emotional intensity and spontaneity were not just reactions to post-war trauma but also conscious breaks from previous constraints. These artists sought to delve into the subconscious mind using Surrealist techniques—creating works as much about process as product.

>>Museum Curator: Absolutely! It's fascinating how these elements combined to redefine artistic expression during that time.

>>Art Historian: You know, the post-war era's cultural climate played a significant role in Abstract Expressionism’s acceptance. Its apolitical nature made it safe during McCarthyism allowing artists deep personal exploration without overt political statements—crucial for understanding why New York became an artistic hub. 
 >>Contemporary Artist: You know, what I find fascinating is how this movement's emphasis on personal expression has evolved. In my experience, artists today are using digital media and installations to channel that same raw emotion and spontaneity. It's like Pollock's dance with the canvas has transformed into a multimedia performance.

>>Art Critic: From a critical standpoint, the evolution of Abstract Expressionism into digital media and installations is not merely an extension but a transformation. The raw emotion and spontaneity that Pollock embodied are now channeled through interactive and immersive experiences, challenging traditional notions of authorship and originality. Isn't it fascinating how technology redefines these concepts?

>>Art Historian: Interestingly, the transition from Abstract Expressionism to contemporary practices highlights a fascinating evolution in artistic expression. One could argue that the movement's emphasis on spontaneity and emotional intensity has found new life in today's digital and interactive mediums. How do you think this shift impacts the viewer's experience?

>>Contemporary Artist: Well, um, what I find really interesting is how artists today are blending traditional techniques with new media. For instance, I've seen installations where digital projections interact with physical paint on canvas—truly a dynamic experience for the viewer. It's like merging Pollock's spontaneity with modern technology!

>>Museum Curator: Absolutely! This blending creates such unique experiences for viewers. It reminds me of how early Abstract Expressionists drew from various influences to create something entirely new.

>>Art Critic: True, but we need to ensure it doesn't dilute Abstract Expressionism's essence. Do you think this mix captures its spontaneity?

>>Art Historian: It does push boundaries while honoring their legacy. How do viewers respond to this blend?

>>Contemporary Artist: Honestly, it's all about creating an immersive experience for the viewer. When you combine different mediums, it adds layers to the artwork that can evoke deeper emotional responses.

>>Museum Curator: Exactly! And by doing so, we can engage audiences in ways that were previously unimaginable.

>>Art Critic: But let's not forget that while innovation is crucial, maintaining authenticity is equally important. We need to strike a balance between embracing new technologies and preserving the core values of Abstract Expressionism.

>>Museum Curator: I see your point, but I believe innovation can coexist with authenticity if done thoughtfully.

>>Art Historian: Well said! The challenge lies in ensuring that these contemporary works continue to evoke the same emotional intensity as their predecessors while exploring new frontiers. 
 >>Art Critic: One cannot overlook the pivotal role of critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg in shaping the narrative around Abstract Expressionism. Greenberg's formalist approach and Rosenberg's concept of 'action painting' provided frameworks that both elevated and constrained the movement. Isn't it fascinating how their differing perspectives influenced public perception?

>>Contemporary Artist: Absolutely, their differing views really pushed artists in unique directions. I remember reading about how Pollock was influenced by both. He took elements from Greenberg’s focus on medium purity but also embraced Rosenberg’s spontaneity.

>>Art Historian: Yes, Pollock is a great example. Greenberg emphasized the flatness of the canvas and materiality of paint itself, while Rosenberg saw the canvas as an arena for spontaneous expression. This created a rich dialogue within Abstract Expressionism but also set up internal tensions that contributed to its decline. Don't you think?

>>Museum Curator: From our perspective, these critics didn't just shape public perception; they influenced which works we decided to keep and show. I recall curating an exhibition where this tension was evident—Rothko’s serene color fields contrasted sharply with Pollock’s chaotic drips.

>>Contemporary Artist: To be fair, their critiques really pushed the movement forward in amazing ways! But sometimes I feel like Greenberg's rigid formalism stifled creativity a bit too much.

>>Art Historian: Indeed, this interplay between formalism and action painting created a fascinating dichotomy within Abstract Expressionism. From an art historical perspective, this tension not only fueled innovation but also highlighted inherent contradictions within the movement. These internal conflicts, coupled with external cultural shifts, likely precipitated its decline by the early 1960s.

>>Art Critic: From a critical standpoint, it's essential to recognize that while Greenberg's formalism and Rosenberg's 'action painting' provided significant frameworks, they also imposed certain limitations. For instance, Greenberg often dismissed emotional depth in favor of formality while Rosenberg championed raw emotion.

>>Museum Curator: Absolutely! And reflecting this tension in our exhibitions helps visitors understand these complexities better. It’s always interesting to see how people react differently to Rothko versus Pollock.

>>Contemporary Artist: Honestly, it's incredible how these critiques not only shaped Abstract Expressionism but also pushed artists to explore new boundaries—from refining techniques to embracing spontaneity—it was like a creative explosion!

>>Art Historian: Interestingly enough, this fertile ground for innovation also highlighted contradictions within Abstract Expressionism itself. The emphasis on individual expression may have led to artistic exhaustion by the early 1960s. 
 >>Museum Curator: One of our key challenges is making sure our collection not only shows the historical importance of Abstract Expressionism but also connects with people today. Our recent acquisition of a lesser-known work by Norman Lewis has sparked new interest among visitors. What do you all think?

>>Contemporary Artist: I think we can make Abstract Expressionism resonate today by integrating interactive elements like virtual reality. Imagine experiencing a Pollock painting in an immersive environment—it's like stepping into his creative process!

>>Art Historian: The historical context is crucial too. After World War II, artists like Pollock and Rothko were responding to global turmoil, which adds layers of meaning to their work.

>>Art Critic: True, but we need to be careful that technology doesn't dilute the raw emotion that defines this movement.

>>Contemporary Artist: To be fair—

>>Museum Curator (interrupting): Hold on! Other museums have integrated tech successfully without losing authenticity—like the Van Gogh Museum's VR experience.

>>Art Critic: Good point! But we still need to balance innovation with preserving what makes these works powerful.

>>Contemporary Artist: Absolutely! It's all about finding that balance between new ideas and keeping true to the original art. 
 >>Art Critic: It's amazing how the emotional impact of Abstract Expressionism still resonates today. I remember seeing a Rothko piece that just enveloped viewers in its vast fields of color, creating an almost meditative experience. Isn't it incredible how such simplicity can evoke deep emotions?

>>Art Historian: Absolutely! And it's fascinating how this movement really took off after WWII, as artists were reacting to all that trauma and disillusionment. Have you ever felt that historical context influencing your own work or perception of art?

>>Contemporary Artist: Oh, for sure. I once just let the paint flow freely on a canvas—it was so liberating! The physical act of painting in Abstract Expressionism can be incredibly freeing.

>>Museum Curator: That's a great point. I've seen artists use their entire bodies to create pieces, almost like they're dancing with the canvas. It adds a whole new dimension to their work.

>>Art Historian: And let's not forget the influence of Surrealism on Abstract Expressionism. André Masson's automatic drawing techniques inspired Pollock's drip paintings. Have any of you tried spontaneous methods like that?

>>Contemporary Artist: Actually, yes! One time I literally danced around the canvas, letting the paint splatter and flow with my movements. It felt like pure freedom! Anyone else experimented with something similar?

>>Museum Curator: You know, that's what makes Abstract Expressionism so unique—it allows for such personal and unfiltered connections with the medium.

>>Art Critic: From an analytical perspective, this spontaneity can sometimes lead to skepticism from traditionalists who prefer more structured forms of art.

>>Art Historian: Right! The post-WWII era not only influenced the emergence of Abstract Expressionism but also shaped its reception. Artists like Pollock and Rothko faced skepticism before gaining acclaim. Have any of you encountered similar challenges in your artistic journeys?

>>Contemporary Artist: Definitely! There have been times when my work was dismissed as too chaotic or unrefined by some critics.

>>Museum Curator: That's interesting because those very qualities are what make your work stand out to others.

>>Art Critic: Exactly! Sometimes it's those unconventional approaches that push boundaries and redefine art itself. 
 >>Museum Curator: We need to consider how these unconventional approaches can be integrated into our collection. It's essential to weigh the potential impact on audience engagement and whether it enhances or detracts from the core values of Abstract Expressionism.

>>Art Historian: The historical context of Abstract Expressionism post-World War II is crucial in understanding its impact. The movement emerged as a reaction to the trauma and disillusionment of the war, reflecting a shift from American social realism to a more introspective and emotional exploration. This backdrop provides a rich tapestry for integrating both traditional elements and contemporary innovations in our exhibition.

>>Contemporary Artist: From an artist's perspective, integrating digital media and interactive installations can really enhance the viewer's emotional connection to Abstract Expressionism. I mean, imagine experiencing Pollock's action painting through virtual reality! But we do need to consider if this might overshadow the raw, physical essence of the original works, right?

>>Art Critic: Integrating digital media can enhance engagement, but we must ensure it doesn't overshadow the raw emotional intensity of Abstract Expressionism.

>>Museum Curator: Well, it's about finding a balance. We want to engage audiences with new technologies without losing what makes Abstract Expressionism so powerful.

>>Art Historian: Exactly. We need to think about whether adding digital media will take away from the raw emotion that makes Abstract Expressionism so powerful.

>>Contemporary Artist: You know what? Using VR could be really cool for showing Pollock's work! But yeah, we gotta make sure it doesn't steal the spotlight from his actual paintings.

>>Art Critic: I'm not entirely convinced that digital elements won't distract from the art itself.

>>Museum Curator: That's a fair point, but maybe there's a way to integrate them subtly?

>>Art Historian: By carefully curating these elements, we can provide context and depth without compromising on authenticity.

>>Contemporary Artist: And you know what? It could even attract younger audiences who are more tech-savvy and open to interactive experiences.

>>Art Critic: That's true. Engaging younger audiences is important for keeping art relevant across generations.

>>Museum Curator: Alright then, let's explore options where digital media serves as an enhancement tool rather than a focal point. How about creating an interactive guide app that visitors can use while viewing the exhibits?

>>Art Historian: That sounds like a good start—let's ensure whatever approach we take remains true to the spirit of Abstract Expressionism while embracing innovation thoughtfully.

>>Contemporary Artist: Agreed! Let's make sure we're enhancing without overshadowing. 
 >>Museum Curator: Alright, let's wrap up our action items. First, we need to develop the interactive guide app. I'll coordinate with the tech team and make sure it fits our curatorial standards.

>>Art Historian: We should definitely include a detailed historical timeline in the app. It'll help users understand how Abstract Expressionism evolved and its cultural impact.

>>Contemporary Artist: And I think we should also have some workshops or interactive sessions for visitors. It would be great if they could engage with the art more deeply and maybe even try out some abstract expressionist techniques themselves.

>>Art Critic: Yeah, that sounds good. Just make sure the workshops are engaging but also meaningful. We don't want to oversimplify the significance of Abstract Expressionism.

>>Museum Curator: Absolutely. We'll need to find a balance between fun and depth. How about setting up a pilot workshop next month to see how it goes?

>>Art Historian: That sounds good. And we should ensure that the historical timeline in the app includes key milestones and influential figures from both well-known and lesser-known artists.

>>Contemporary Artist: Exactly! Maybe during these workshops, people can create their own pieces inspired by Abstract Expressionism.

>>Art Critic: That could be really engaging.

>>Museum Curator: Right, we'll keep that in mind. So, I'll handle coordinating with the tech team for the app development and set up an initial meeting for planning these workshops.

>>Art Historian: Great. I'll work on compiling the historical content for the app, making sure it covers all significant aspects of Abstract Expressionism's evolution.

>>Contemporary Artist: And I'll start brainstorming ideas for those interactive sessions and workshops. Maybe even get some feedback from fellow artists on what could be most engaging.

>>Art Critic: Perfect. Let's also set regular check-ins to review progress and make adjustments as needed. 
 >>Museum Curator: Well, I think we've had a really productive discussion today. The integration of these new technologies will definitely enhance our visitors' experience.

>>Art Historian: Absolutely. Balancing innovation with authenticity is key.

>>Contemporary Artist: Yeah, it's been a great discussion. I love how we've combined historical context with contemporary relevance.

>>Art Critic: Totally! But we should be careful not to overdo it with the tech stuff.

>>Museum Curator: Exactly, we need to ensure that everything aligns with our curatorial standards while being engaging for visitors.

>>Art Historian: I'm looking forward to compiling the historical content for the app.

>>Contemporary Artist: And I'm excited about brainstorming ideas for those interactive sessions and workshops. It's going to be a lot of fun!

>>Art Critic: Just remember, we need regular check-ins to review progress and make adjustments as needed.

>>Museum Curator: Agreed. Let's set up bi-weekly check-ins starting next Monday at 10 AM to review our progress and make adjustments as needed. Thank you all for your contributions today."
