Applied Anthropology,"Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories, methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper ""The Aims of Anthropology"".[1] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as ""anthropology put to use"".[2] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health, education, government, and business. 

In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application, Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a ""complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy"".[3] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. 

The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on ""the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences."" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses four subareas: sociocultural anthropology, biological (or physical) anthropology, archaeology, and linguistic anthropology.[4] Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an ""applied anthropologist"". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example, a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.

Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic associations, advocacy groups, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.[5][6]

Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to, ethnography, participant observation, snowballing, interviews, and focus groups. Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis, surveying, archival research, and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.

The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism.[7] Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: ""The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied."" The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).[3]

Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural ""broker"", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst.[3]

There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting the project.[8]

The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one's own preconceived cultural notions from one's work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.[9][10]

The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: ""The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that do offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice"" [emphasis in original].[11] In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to ""remedy"" a complex social issue.

There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).

The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called Human Organization, published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called Anthropology in Action.

The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as ""Apply"".[12] Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network,[13] which annually organises the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.

Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Jonathan Benthall (author of The Best of Anthropology Today) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology ""for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity"".

Applied anthropology was defined as a praxis-based approach involving direct action and policy formulation within cultural systems. The American Anthropological Association outlines anthropology's broad scope across sociocultural, biological, archaeological, and linguistic subfields. Applied anthropologists often collaborate with nonacademic clients like governments and NGOs, using methodologies such as ethnography and participant observation to inform policy or market products. Ethical challenges were highlighted, including balancing client interests with community needs and addressing issues of privacy and ownership. Despite guidelines from major organizations like AAA and SFAA, ensuring culturally sensitive research remains challenging. Criticism exists regarding interactions between anthropologists and government agencies due to differing priorities in development projects. Debates persist over objectivity in fieldwork versus recognizing inherent biases. The necessity for cultural relativism was underscored by discussions on female genital cutting practices. Key organizations supporting applied anthropology include AAA, SFAA, NAPA in the US; ASA's ""Apply"" network; EASA's Applied Anthropology Network; and the Royal Anthropological Institute's Lucy Mair Medal for excellence in applied work.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for collaboration.\n- Exchange quick greetings among participants\n- Set expectations for a collaborative and flexible meeting\n- Highlight the importance of applied anthropology in solving real-world problems"", ""Scene 2: Applied Anthropology Overview\nTLDR: Discuss the scope and significance of applied anthropology.\n- Define applied anthropology and its practical applications\n- Explore its role in public health, education, government, and business\n- Share insights on collaboration with nonacademic clients like governments and NGOs"", ""Scene 3: Methodological Approaches\nTLDR: Dive into anthropological methods used in applied research.\n- Discuss ethnography and participant observation techniques\n- Highlight methodological precision in informing policy or market products\n- Encourage sharing personal experiences with these methodologies"", ""Scene 4: Ethical Considerations\nTLDR: Address ethical challenges faced by applied anthropologists.\n- Explore balancing client interests with community needs\n- Discuss issues of privacy, ownership, and cultural sensitivity\n- Allow for spontaneous contributions on ethical dilemmas encountered"", ""Scene 5: Cultural Relativism Discussion\nTLDR: Examine cultural relativism within anthropological research.\n- Debate objectivity versus inherent biases in fieldwork\n- Discuss cultural relativism's necessity using examples like female genital cutting practices\n- Encourage respectful understanding of diverse cultural practices"", ""Scene 6: Policy Implications and Solutions\nTLDR: Analyze policy formulation based on anthropological insights.\n- Discuss practical solutions for societal issues informed by research findings\n- Explore actionable steps for effective policy implementation \n- Allow room for disagreement and resolution regarding policy impacts"", ""Scene 7: Open Floor for Spontaneous Topics \nTLDR: Provide space for unplanned discussions or reflections. \n - Invite participants to share any additional thoughts or experiences \n - Encourage dialogue on emerging topics related to anthropology \n - Foster an environment where natural topic evolution is welcomed"", ""Scene 8: Closing Remarks \n TLDR: Wrap up the meeting with key takeaways. \n - Summarize main points discussed during the meeting \n - Highlight successful collaborations or insights gained \n - Thank participants for their contributions and encourage ongoing dialogue""]",">>Cultural Anthropologist: Hey everyone! Let's kick off this meeting by discussing how applied anthropology can make a tangible impact. What are your thoughts on this, Ethics Specialist?
>>Ethics Specialist: I agree, balancing interests is crucial. Activist Anthropologist, how do you think we can drive real change effectively?
>>Activist Anthropologist: Applied anthropology isn't just about research; it's about driving real change. We must act now to ensure our insights lead to benefits for those we study. Methodology Expert, how do you see methodological precision playing a role here?
>>Methodology Expert: Great point! Methodological precision in our ethnographic methods enhances our understanding and ensures that our research truly benefits the communities involved. Cultural Relativism Specialist, what do you think about respecting diverse practices in this context?
>>Cultural Relativism Specialist: Respecting diverse practices is key to making our work impactful and culturally sensitive. Policy Analyst, how can we translate these insights into effective policies?
>>Policy Analyst: From a policy perspective, let's streamline efforts to ensure that insights from applied anthropology translate into effective policies. It's crucial to focus on actionable steps that genuinely benefit communities while respecting cultural nuances. 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: Applied anthropology is like the Swiss Army knife of social sciences. It can tackle everything from public health to business strategies! It's fascinating how we collaborate with governments and NGOs to make real-world changes.
>>Ethics Advisor: True, but it's crucial that we balance the needs of our clients with those of the communities we're working with. How do we ensure our interventions are respectful and effective without imposing external values?
>>Community Advocate: Absolutely. It's not just about solving problems—it's about empowering communities to drive their own change. Collaboration can be powerful if we ensure the voices of those affected are front and center. We need to start implementing these changes soon.
>>Research Specialist: And precision in our approach is key. Using methods like ethnography and participant observation—
>>Anthropologist: Sorry to interrupt, but could you give an example of how participant observation has been used effectively in recent projects?
>>Research Specialist: Sure! In a recent public health initiative in rural areas, participant observation helped us understand local health practices and beliefs. This allowed us to tailor our interventions more effectively by respecting existing traditions while introducing new health measures.

>>Anthropologist: That's a great example. Applied anthropology offers a unique opportunity to respect and understand diverse practices while collaborating with nonacademic clients.
>>Ethics Advisor: Exactly, but navigating ethical complexities is challenging. We must ensure our interventions respect community autonomy while addressing client objectives.
>>Cultural Anthropologist: We're cultural detectives, uncovering insights that can transform public health initiatives or educational programs.
>>Ethics Advisor: The challenge lies in ensuring our work doesn't inadvertently perpetuate colonialist or orientalist perspectives. How can we ethically navigate these complexities while achieving meaningful outcomes for both clients and communities?
>>Anthropologist: It's about finding common ground and ensuring our interventions are not just effective but also culturally harmonious.
>>Community Advocate: Applied anthropology should empower communities to take charge of their own narratives. For instance, in my last project, we worked directly with local leaders to develop sustainable farming practices that respected traditional methods while improving yields. 
 >>Methodology Expert: Ethnography helps us get a deep understanding of community dynamics, which is crucial for policy decisions or product development. How does this method enhance our understanding?
>>Ethics Specialist: It's important to balance client interests with community needs when using these methods. How do we respect cultural nuances while providing actionable insights?
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Building on that, ethnography lets us see why people act as they do—essential for crafting effective policies. How does this reflect societal norms?
>>Activist Anthropologist: We should use these tools not just for data but also to empower communities. These methods should be tools for advocacy, helping us understand community needs deeply and act on them. What can we do to make a difference?
>>Policy Analyst: I agree—how can we ensure our policies reflect this understanding? What are the practical outcomes when these insights are translated into policy?
>>Cultural Relativism Specialist: Respecting diverse practices means understanding them in their own context through these methodologies—ethnography especially offers deep appreciation for cultural diversity.

>>Methodology Expert: In real-world applications, these methods guide us through intricate landscapes of human behavior by pinpointing where policies might succeed or fail based on understanding actions' 'why'. Fascinating! How do we ensure these insights translate effectively into policy?

>>Ethics Specialist: Considering the implications of ethnography and participant observation, how can these methods be employed ethically to ensure both client objectives and community welfare are harmoniously balanced? It's essential to respect cultural nuances while still providing actionable insights.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: I mean, in the grand scheme of things, ethnography and participant observation act like cultural magnifying glasses. They let us zoom in on subtle interactions shaping societal norms. When applied effectively, they transform policymaking by aligning it with lived experiences of communities.

>>Activist Anthropologist: Absolutely! Ethnography and participant observation should be more than just methods; they should be catalysts for community empowerment. We must act now to ensure these tools help communities articulate their needs and drive meaningful change.

>>Policy Analyst: Actually... From an ethical standpoint too—we must consider how these methodologies can empower communities while respecting their autonomy. How do we ensure our approaches foster genuine collaboration with involved communities?

>>Cultural Relativism Specialist: You know... Respecting diverse practices means understanding them in their own context through these methodologies—ethnography especially offers deep appreciation for cultural diversity. 
 >>Sarah (Ethics Specialist): We need to find a way to balance what our clients want with what the community needs. In our last project in the rural area, we faced issues with privacy when collecting data. How can we handle this better next time?
>>John (Cultural Anthropologist): That's a great point, Sarah. I remember that project well. It's like walking a tightrope trying to respect both sides. Maybe we could involve community leaders more directly in the planning stages.
>>Emily (Activist Anthropologist): Absolutely, John. As activists, our priority should be empowering communities rather than just meeting client demands. When we worked in the urban slums last year, respecting privacy was crucial for maintaining trust.
>>Sarah: Considering those experiences, it's clear that our methods need to respect community autonomy while still fulfilling client objectives. What practical steps can we take to ensure this balance?
>>Michael (Methodology Expert): One approach could be refining our participant observation techniques. For instance, during our fieldwork in the coastal village, involving locals as co-researchers helped us understand their needs better and respect their privacy.
>>Anna (Cultural Relativism Specialist): Michael's right. Respecting diverse practices means understanding cultural contexts deeply. In my experience working with indigenous tribes, appreciating their views on ownership was key to ethical research.
>>Sarah: Exactly, Anna. While client goals are important, the dignity of the community must remain at the forefront. How do we ensure our methods reflect this without imposing external values?
>>John: Cultural sensitivity isn't just about traditions; it's about understanding societal norms that shape them. During my work in Southeast Asia, collaborating closely with local experts helped avoid imposing external values while achieving practical outcomes.
>>Anna: And considering cultural contexts is vital for approaching privacy and ownership respectfully. How can we make sure our methods are both culturally sensitive and ethically sound?
>>Sarah: We must adapt our research methods to respect both client objectives and community autonomy equally. Any ideas on how to achieve this balance practically?
>>Emily: In fighting for justice, creating partnerships where privacy and ownership are respected as fundamental rights is essential. Our collaboration with grassroots organizations has shown that empowering communities leads to better outcomes.
>>David (Policy Analyst): The key is ensuring that our research methods are not only ethically sound but also practically viable. What have been some successful strategies when prioritizing community autonomy while meeting client objectives?
>>Sarah: Transparency in intentions is crucial here too—how do we navigate potential conflicts between client goals and community needs without compromising ethical integrity?
>>John: Applied anthropology bridges gaps between these interests effectively. Using insights from past projects can help create solutions that respect cultural nuances while being practical.
>>Michael: Participant observation has proven powerful in genuinely understanding and respecting community needs during fieldwork in various regions—how does this method help maintain ethical integrity while balancing client objectives? 
 >>Cultural Relativism Specialist: You know, we need to understand different practices in their own cultures without imposing our biases. It's crucial that we appreciate these differences and engage in open dialogue.
>>Ethics Specialist: The challenge lies in balancing our understanding of cultural practices like female genital cutting with the imperative to protect individual rights. How does this align with our values of respecting autonomy while ensuring safety?
>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's fascinating how these practices challenge our understanding of societal norms. We need practical solutions that respect both individual rights and cultural contexts.
>>Activist Anthropologist: Well, as activists, we must act now! Cultural relativism is vital, but we can't ignore the urgency of advocating for human rights. Let's brainstorm some immediate steps we can take to support these communities while respecting their traditions.
>>Ethics Specialist: Considering the implications of cultural relativism, we must tread carefully to ensure that our understanding doesn't inadvertently endorse practices that may harm individuals. Perhaps we could look into case studies where this balance has been successfully achieved?
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Technology, right? Always keeping us on our toes! Anyway, as I was saying... We need to find ways to engage communities in dialogue that respects their traditions while also addressing human rights concerns.
[Technical difficulties - screen freezes]
>>Methodology Expert: Uh-oh! Looks like we've lost connection for a moment there.
>>Ethics Specialist: Oh no! Can everyone hear me now? 
[Participants nod or respond affirmatively]
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Okay, as I was saying... We need practical solutions that respect both individual rights and cultural contexts. How does this reflect societal norms?
>>Ethics Specialist: Indeed! It's crucial that we navigate these cultural practices with a nuanced understanding, ensuring our ethical frameworks don't inadvertently endorse harm. How do we reconcile respecting cultural contexts with advocating for universal human rights?
[Technical difficulties - screen freezes again]
>>Methodology Expert: Looks like we're having some connectivity issues today!
[Laughter from participants]
>>Ethics Specialist: Let's try again—how do ethnographic methods help us engage communities in meaningful dialogue about practices like female genital cutting? 
 >>Policy Analyst: We need to think about how community leaders can be involved in shaping policies that address practices like female genital cutting. It's crucial to create frameworks that respect cultural contexts while advocating for human rights.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Involving community leaders in policy-making can be incredibly effective. For instance, we could collaborate with local leaders to create educational programs that respect cultural traditions while promoting health and human rights. These insights can lead to real-world change!

>>Ethics Specialist: We really need to make sure community leaders are involved and their voices are actually heard and integrated into policy decisions. How can we balance respect for cultural practices with the urgent need to protect human rights?

>>Activist Anthropologist: We must push for policies that empower community leaders to drive change. What steps can we take right now? We need action!

>>Methodology Expert (interrupting): Excuse me for interrupting, but how do you propose handling situations where community leaders might resist changes due to deeply ingrained traditions?

>>Ethics Specialist: That's a great point. We need strategies that include continuous dialogue and education about the benefits of change while respecting their perspectives. Finding common ground is key.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: We could look at how community leaders have successfully addressed similar issues in other regions. For example, in Kenya, local leaders collaborated with NGOs to create alternative rites of passage that respect cultural traditions while eliminating harmful practices.

>>Activist Anthropologist: That's a good example! Another one is Ethiopia, where local communities worked together with health professionals to develop new ceremonies that honor tradition without compromising health and safety.

>>(Technical difficulty) Cultural Relativism Specialist: Uh-oh! I think you're on mute.

>>(Methodology Expert unmutes)

>>Methodology Expert: Sorry about that! Building on our discussion about engaging community leaders, participant observation can reveal nuanced community dynamics that surveys might miss. How does this method enhance our understanding? 
 >>Alex (Activist Anthropologist): You know, just observing isn't enough. We need to get the community involved in making decisions. Change should come from those who are directly affected.

>>Jamie (Cultural Anthropologist): That's a great point, Alex. It's interesting how we can use anthropology in business too—like understanding consumer behavior to improve products and marketing.

>>Sam (Ethics Specialist): Right, but how do we make sure our work is respectful and effective? Balancing what clients want with what communities need is tricky.

>>Alex: Exactly, Sam. It's not just about respecting traditions; sometimes we have to challenge them if they're harmful. But the key is empowering communities to lead that change themselves.

>>Taylor (Cultural Relativism Specialist): I agree, Alex. Every culture has its own significance and values. We need to learn from them while fostering mutual respect. How do we appreciate these differences without imposing our views?

>>Jordan (Methodology Expert): Good question, Taylor! Participant observation is great for understanding community dynamics, but combining it with interviews or focus groups gives us a fuller picture.

>>Casey (Policy Analyst): And that's where policy comes in—using those insights to create frameworks that are both respectful and practical for solving societal issues.

>>Taylor: Casey, it's fascinating how applied anthropology can connect traditional practices with modern needs. Respecting diverse practices while fostering mutual understanding is crucial.

>>Sam: Absolutely! But how do we ensure community voices are truly heard in policy decisions? Balancing cultural respect with advocating for human rights is essential.

>>Jamie: Speaking of real-world applications like urban planning—understanding community dynamics leads to more inclusive city designs. It really reflects societal norms!

>>Alex: Jamie's right! Beyond observation, challenging harmful traditions while empowering communities is vital. What steps can we take?

>>Jordan: Well... Participant observation captures subtleties but should be complemented by interviews or focus groups for effective policy formulation.

>>Sam: Actually... From an ethical standpoint, reconciling cultural sensitivity with addressing human rights infringements requires careful consideration. How does this align with our values?

[The group pauses as they consider each other's points.]

>>Casey: You know, I remember working on a project where the local community was initially resistant because they felt their traditions were being overlooked...

[Everyone listens intently as Casey shares their experience.] 
 >>Policy Analyst: You know, looking at it from a policy angle, involving community leaders in decision-making has really been key. We've seen how this approach can lead to policies that are not only effective but also respectful.

>>Ethics Specialist: From an ethical standpoint, it's important to recognize how well we've integrated community voices into our policies. This method respects cultural nuances and ensures interventions are both impactful and considerate. Actually, the collaboration between community leaders and policymakers has been a significant achievement in this meeting.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Culturally speaking, this collaboration has shown how applied anthropology can bridge gaps. It's been fascinating to see mutual respect grow through these efforts. Thanks to everyone for sharing your insights on integrating community perspectives. Let's continue discussing how we can apply these learnings moving forward."
