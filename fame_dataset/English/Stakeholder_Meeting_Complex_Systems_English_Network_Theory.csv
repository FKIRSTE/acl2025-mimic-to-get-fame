Network Theory,"In mathematics, computer science and network science, network theory is a part of graph theory. It defines networks as graphs where the vertices or edges possess attributes. Network theory analyses these networks over the symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between their (discrete) components.

Network theory has applications in many disciplines, including statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical engineering,[1][2] biology,[3] archaeology,[4] linguistics,[5][6][7] economics, finance, operations research, climatology, ecology, public health,[8][9][10] sociology,[11] psychology,[12] and neuroscience.[13][14][15] Applications of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks, epistemological networks, etc.; see List of network theory topics for more examples.

Euler's solution of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem is considered to be the first true proof in the theory of networks.

Network problems that involve finding an optimal way of doing something are studied as combinatorial optimization. Examples include network flow, shortest path problem, transport problem, transshipment problem, location problem, matching problem, assignment problem, packing problem,  routing problem, critical path analysis, and program evaluation and review technique.

The analysis of electric power systems could be conducted using network theory from two main points of view:

Social network analysis examines the structure of relationships between social entities.[17] These entities are often persons, but may also be groups, organizations, nation states, web sites, or scholarly publications.

Since the 1970s, the empirical study of networks has played a central role in social science, and many of the mathematical and statistical tools used for studying networks have been first developed in sociology.[18]  Amongst many other applications, social network analysis has been used to understand the diffusion of innovations, news and rumors.[19]  Similarly, it has been used to examine the spread of both diseases and health-related behaviors.[20]  It has also been applied to the study of markets, where it has been used to examine the role of trust in exchange relationships and of social mechanisms in setting prices.[21]  It has been used to study recruitment into political movements, armed groups, and other social organizations.[22]   It has also been used to conceptualize scientific disagreements[23] as well as academic prestige.[24]  More recently, network analysis (and its close cousin traffic analysis) has gained a significant use in military intelligence,[25] for uncovering insurgent networks of both hierarchical and leaderless nature.[citation needed]

With the recent explosion of publicly available high throughput biological data, the analysis of molecular networks has gained significant interest.[26] The type of analysis in this context is closely related to social network analysis, but often focusing on local patterns in the network. For example, network motifs are small subgraphs that are over-represented in the network. Similarly, activity motifs are patterns in the attributes of nodes and edges in the network that are over-represented given the network structure. Using networks to analyze patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs, allows us to visualize the nature and strength of interactions between species. The analysis of biological networks with respect to diseases has led to the development of the field of network medicine.[27]  Recent examples of application of network theory in biology include applications to understanding the cell cycle[28] as well as a quantitative framework for developmental processes.[29]

The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale. The resulting narrative networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.[31] This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis,[32] whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.[30]

Link analysis is a subset of network analysis, exploring associations between objects. An example may be examining the addresses of suspects and victims, the telephone numbers they have dialed, and financial transactions that they have partaken in during a given timeframe, and the familial relationships between these subjects as a part of police investigation. Link analysis here provides the crucial relationships and associations between very many objects of different types that are not apparent from isolated pieces of information. Computer-assisted or fully automatic computer-based link analysis is increasingly employed by banks and insurance agencies in fraud detection, by telecommunication operators in telecommunication network analysis, by medical sector in epidemiology and pharmacology, in law enforcement investigations, by search engines for relevance rating (and conversely by the spammers for spamdexing and by business owners for search engine optimization), and everywhere else where relationships between many objects have to be analyzed. Links are  also derived from similarity of time behavior in both nodes. Examples include climate networks where the links between two locations (nodes) are determined, for example, by the similarity of the rainfall or temperature fluctuations in both sites.[33][34]

Several Web search ranking algorithms use link-based centrality metrics, including Google's PageRank, Kleinberg's HITS algorithm, the CheiRank and TrustRank algorithms. Link analysis is also conducted in information science and communication science in order to understand and extract information from the structure of collections of web pages. For example, the analysis might be of the interlinking between politicians' websites or blogs. Another use is for classifying pages according to their mention in other pages.[35]

Information about the relative importance of nodes and edges in a graph can be obtained through centrality measures, widely used in disciplines like sociology. For example, eigenvector centrality uses the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix corresponding to a network, to determine nodes that tend to be frequently visited. Formally established measures of centrality are degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, subgraph centrality, and Katz centrality. The purpose or objective of analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure to be used. For example, if one is interested in dynamics on networks or the robustness of a network to node/link removal, often the dynamical importance[36]  of a node is the most relevant centrality measure.

These concepts are used to characterize the linking preferences of hubs in a network. Hubs are nodes which have a large number of links. Some hubs tend to link to other hubs while others avoid connecting to hubs and prefer to connect to nodes with low connectivity. We say a hub is assortative when it tends to connect to other hubs. A disassortative hub avoids connecting to other hubs. If hubs have connections with the expected random probabilities, they are said to be neutral. There are three methods to quantify degree correlations.[37]

The recurrence matrix of a recurrence plot can be considered as the adjacency matrix of an undirected and unweighted network. This allows for the analysis of time series by network measures. Applications range from detection of regime changes over characterizing dynamics to synchronization analysis.[38][39][40]

Many real networks are embedded in space. Examples include, transportation and other infrastructure networks, brain neural networks. Several models for spatial networks have been developed.[41]

Other networks emphasise the evolution over time of systems of nodes and their interconnections. Temporal networks are used for example to study how financial risk has spread across countries.[42] In this study, temporal networks are used to also visually trace the intricate dynamics of financial contagion during crises. Unlike traditional network approaches that aggregate or analyze static snapshots, the study uses a time-respecting path methodology to preserve the sequence and timing of financial crises contagion events. This enables the identification of nodes as sources, transmitters, or receivers of financial stress, avoiding mischaracterizations inherent in static or aggregated methods. Following this approach, banks are found to serve as key intermediaries in contagion paths, and temporal analysis pinpoints smaller countries like Greece and Italy as significant origins of shocks during crises—insights obscured by static approaches that overemphasize large economies like the US or Japan.

Temporal networks can also be used to explore how cooperation evolves in dynamic, real-world population structures where interactions are time-dependent.[43] Here the authors find that network temporality enhances cooperation compared to static networks, even though ""bursty"" interaction patterns typically hinder it. This finding also shows how cooperation and other emergent behaviours can thrive in realistic, time-varying population structures, challenging conventional assumptions rooted in static models.

In psychology, temporal networks enable the understanding of psychological disorders by framing them as dynamic systems of interconnected symptoms rather than outcomes of a single underlying cause. Using ""nodes"" to represent symptoms and ""edges"" to signify their direct interactions, symptoms like insomnia and fatigue are shown how they influence each other over time; also, disorders such as depression are shown not to be fixed entities but evolving networks, where identifying ""bridge symptoms"" like concentration difficulties can explain comorbidity between conditions such as depression and anxiety.[44]

Lastly, temporal networks enable a better understanding and controlling of the spread of infectious diseases.[45] Unlike traditional static networks, which assume continuous, unchanging connections, temporal networks account for the precise timing and duration of interactions between individuals. This dynamic approach reveals critical nuances, such as how diseases can spread via time-sensitive pathways that static models miss. Temporal data, such as interactions captured through Bluetooth sensors or in hospital wards, can improve predictions of outbreak speed and extent. Overlooking temporal correlations can lead to significant errors in estimating epidemic dynamics, emphasizing the need for a temporal framework to develop more accurate strategies for disease control.

Content in a complex network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread.[46]  In conserved spread, the total amount of content that enters a complex network remains constant as it passes through.  The model of conserved spread can best be represented by a pitcher containing a fixed amount of water being poured into a series of funnels connected by tubes.  Here, the pitcher represents the original source and the water is the content being spread.  The funnels and connecting tubing represent the nodes and the connections between nodes, respectively.  As the water passes from one funnel into another, the water disappears instantly from the funnel that was previously exposed to the water.  In non-conserved spread, the amount of content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network.  The model of non-conserved spread can best be represented by a continuously running faucet running through a series of funnels connected by tubes.  Here, the amount of water from the original source is infinite. Also, any funnels that have been exposed to the water continue to experience the water even as it passes into successive funnels.  The non-conserved model is the most suitable for explaining the transmission of most infectious diseases, neural excitation, information and rumors, etc.

The question of how to immunize efficiently scale free networks which represent realistic networks such as the Internet and social networks has been studied extensively. One such strategy is to immunize the largest  degree nodes, i.e., targeted (intentional) attacks[47] since for this case

{\displaystyle pc}

 is relatively high and fewer nodes are needed to be immunized. 
However, in most realistic networks the global structure is not available and the  largest degree nodes are unknown.

I hope you're all doing well. Today, we'll be discussing the theoretical foundations and practical applications of network theory across various disciplines.

>>Computer Scientist: Hi all! Great to see you here today; let's dive into how we can use network theory to optimize internet connections and manage data flow efficiently.

>>Sociologist: Hello! It's wonderful seeing such a diverse group today; from my end, I'll explore how this helps us understand human interactions better through social networks.

>>Biologist: Morning! Really looking forward to our discussion on applying these concepts in biology—especially within ecosystems and cellular networks!

>>Electrical Engineer: Hey folks; can't wait to share insights on optimizing power grids with you all using principles from network theory. 
 >>Mathematician: So, recent advancements in network theory have given us better models for understanding complex systems. Temporal networks, for example, help us trace financial contagion during crises by preserving event sequences and timing. Any questions?

>>Computer Scientist: Exactly! With these new models, we can predict how information or malware spreads across computer systems more accurately. By identifying critical nodes, we can enhance cybersecurity significantly. Thoughts?

>>Sociologist: That's interesting. From a social perspective, these advancements let us trace how information spreads on social media with incredible precision. For instance, we can see how misinformation about vaccines gains traction and influences public opinion.

>>Biologist: Absolutely! And in ecology, we can track disease spread within ecosystems much more accurately. Like tracing the spread of avian flu among bird populations to identify critical intervention points.

>>Electrical Engineer: Applying this to power grids is really useful. We can model electricity flow better and prevent outages by identifying potential failure points before they cause problems.

>>Mathematician: To put it simply, the theoretical advancements in temporal networks aren't just limited to finance. They provide a robust framework for understanding dynamic interactions in various fields like epidemiology and social dynamics.

>>Computer Scientist: Think about it: with these advancements, we can optimize data flow in real-time across computer systems. By prioritizing critical nodes, we ensure efficient data transmission and reduce latency.

>>Sociologist: Let's explore how these impact social dynamics further. By understanding the timing and sequence of interactions, we can identify key influencers and moments that shape public opinion—crucial for tackling misinformation or promoting positive change.

>>Biologist: Yeah, it's pretty amazing for tracking diseases too! We can pinpoint exact moments when a pathogen jumps between species or individuals, allowing us to intervene more effectively.

>>Mathematician: Let's assume we apply these theoretical advancements to epidemiology. By preserving the sequence and timing of interactions, we can model the spread of infectious diseases with unprecedented accuracy—identifying critical intervention points to potentially halt outbreaks before they escalate.

>>Computer Scientist: These advancements are like having a real-time GPS for data flow! We navigate and optimize paths that information takes across our systems ensuring efficiency and security—imagine reducing latency while preventing cyber-attacks before they happen!

>>Sociologist: Consider this—these advancements let us trace social movements' spread identifying pivotal moments leading significant societal changes—helping understand grassroots campaigns' momentum or why some protests succeed while others don't.

>>Biologist: Think about how this revolutionizes our understanding cellular processes! Mapping precise timings molecular interactions identifies critical intervention points preventing diseases at cellular level—fascinating right? 
 >>Sociologist: Network theory really shows how misinformation spreads on social media. We saw this during the last election—false info spread so fast! What do you guys think?

>>Computer Scientist: That's interesting! We've seen similar patterns in our data centers. In addition to optimizing traffic flow, we also found that network theory helped us predict potential bottlenecks before they occurred. Anyone else tried something like this?

>>Biologist: Yeah, it's amazing how these principles apply across different fields. Beyond identifying key proteins, network theory has allowed us to simulate how changes in these interactions might affect cellular behavior. For instance, in one study we found that targeting a protein called XYZ could halt cancer cell growth.

>>Mathematician: That's fascinating! Using centrality measures like eigenvector centrality, we can not only identify influencers but also model how information spreads over time. This has profound implications for public policy and marketing strategies.

>>Electrical Engineer: Speaking of applications, in the context of power grids, network theory has been instrumental in identifying critical nodes and optimizing electricity flow. During a recent project, we applied these principles to prevent cascading failures by reinforcing key substations. This not only improved reliability but also reduced downtime significantly.

>>Sociologist: How have you seen network theory impact your work directly? Any specific challenges or successes you'd like to share?

>>Computer Scientist: Well, besides optimizing traffic flow in our data center... By identifying and reinforcing critical nodes, we significantly reduced latency and improved overall system performance. It was like untangling a complex web!

>>Biologist: You know, another interesting aspect is how network theory helps us understand disease progression better. By mapping out protein-protein interactions and targeting critical nodes with specific drugs, we can potentially disrupt disease pathways more effectively.

>>Mathematician: Let's assume we're analyzing a social network to identify key influencers using centrality measures... We can determine which nodes have the most influence based on their connections—crucial for public policy and marketing strategies. 
 >>Sociologist: When we talk about social networks, it's not just about identifying influencers but also understanding how information spreads within communities. This can really shape our engagement strategies.

>>Electrical Engineer: Absolutely! If we apply these principles to power grids, we can make them more resilient and efficient—fewer outages mean happier customers.

>>Mathematician: Right! By finding key points in our systems using network theory, we can improve overall performance and reliability.

>>Computer Scientist: Exactly! In data centers, this means predicting bottlenecks before they happen—keeping everything running smoothly.

>>Sociologist: And from a social angle, knowing how information spreads helps us communicate better with different groups within our community. Does that make sense?

>>Biologist: It's fascinating how these principles apply everywhere—even in cellular networks where they can help us understand disease progression better!

>>Electrical Engineer: Yeah, and the practical implications are huge. By pinpointing critical nodes in the power grid, we reduce the risk of failures and ensure a steady energy supply for everyone.

>>Mathematician: From a theoretical standpoint, using network theory lets us model system behaviors accurately. We can identify key points that keep everything stable and efficient. It’s like having a roadmap for future improvements.

>>Computer Scientist: Think about it this way—in data centers, if we know where potential issues might arise, we can fix them before they cause problems. That keeps everything running smoothly and efficiently.

>>Sociologist: Stakeholder engagement isn't just about sharing information; it's about building real connections within the community. Identifying key influencers helps tailor our communication so that it resonates more effectively with them.

>>Biologist: And in biology, mapping out interactions within cellular networks allows us to find crucial points that could prevent diseases or enhance cell functions. It’s pretty amazing! 
 >>Sociologist: It's interesting how these network principles can apply to social movements. Social media, for example, played a huge role in mobilizing people and spreading information quickly. It's all about those key influencers and their connections.

>>Computer Scientist: If we could use network theory to optimize traffic flow in smart cities, it would be like making sure every vehicle moves smoothly. Think about how much time and fuel we could save. What do you think?

>>Mathematician: What if we applied network theory to the spread of misinformation? We could identify key nodes that act as major sources or amplifiers. By targeting these nodes, we might mitigate the spread more effectively. Does that make sense?

>>Biologist: Mapping out interactions between different species in an ecosystem could help us predict and prevent outbreaks before they happen! It's like having a biological early warning system.

>>Electrical Engineer (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here, but speaking of ecosystems—how do you think network theory could help us manage energy grids better?

>>Mathematician: As I was saying earlier about misinformation spread, it's similar to identifying and neutralizing key points in a power grid to prevent failures. By targeting these critical points, we can reduce the impact of false information.

>>Computer Scientist: Network theory can even help optimize supply chains. By mapping out the entire network of suppliers and distributors, we could identify bottlenecks and streamline operations to ensure products reach consumers faster. Thoughts?

>>Sociologist (overlapping): And don't forget political movements!

>>Biologist: Good point! Let's take turns.

>>Sociologist (smiling): Right! So, during social movements... 
 >>Mathematician: So, centrality measures like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality help us identify the most influential nodes within a network. For example, in social networks, pinpointing key influencers can really change how information spreads.

>>Computer Scientist: Right! In a data center, we could use eigenvector centrality to find the most critical servers handling the majority of traffic. Optimizing these key nodes would reduce latency and prevent bottlenecks. What do you think?

>>Sociologist: From a social perspective, understanding dynamics within social networks is crucial. Degree centrality helps us spot key influencers who can drive movements or spread information quickly. Knowing these figures allows for better engagement strategies.

>>Biologist: Yeah, and in ecology, betweenness centrality helps us identify keystone species that are vital for maintaining ecosystem structure. Targeting these species for conservation could ensure stability and resilience.

>>Mathematician: To put it simply—

>>Electrical Engineer (interrupting): Sorry to jump in—can you clarify how eigenvector centrality differs from degree centrality? I think I missed that part.

>>Mathematician: Sure! Degree centrality counts direct connections each node has; it's straightforward. Eigenvector centrality considers not just direct connections but also how connected your neighbors are. It gives more weight to being connected to other well-connected nodes.

>>Computer Scientist: Think about cybersecurity—we could use betweenness centrality to identify critical nodes that might be targets for attacks. Fortifying these points enhances overall security and prevents breaches.

>>Sociologist: Let's explore this further—eigenvector centrality not only identifies key influencers but also shows their influence based on their connections' importance. This is crucial for understanding how social movements gain momentum and sustain themselves.

>>Biologist: You know, I've seen this firsthand with coral reefs. By focusing on keystone species identified through betweenness centrality, we've been able to implement more effective conservation strategies that have shown real results in maintaining reef health.

>>Electrical Engineer: Interesting point about ecosystems! But I'm curious—do you ever find that focusing too much on certain nodes or species might overlook other important factors?

>>Biologist: That's a valid concern. It's definitely important to consider the whole picture and not just rely on one measure alone.

>>Mathematician: Exactly! These measures are tools to guide us but shouldn't be the sole basis of our decisions. 
 >>Biologist: Temporal networks can help us understand how diseases spread over time by tracking interactions between species. It's pretty interesting!

>>Computer Scientist: Yeah, they could be a game-changer for cybersecurity by predicting and preventing attacks based on interaction timing. Imagine being able to see vulnerabilities before they're exploited.

>>Mathematician: Temporal networks capture dynamic interactions over time...

>>Electrical Engineer: Wait, can you give an example of that?

>>Mathematician: Sure, like in financial contagion scenarios. We can identify not just the key players but also the critical moments when stress propagates through the system.

>>Sociologist: From a social perspective—um—temporal networks help us see how information spreads during events like elections. For instance, we can track how misinformation gains traction at certain points.

>>Electrical Engineer: I see your points, but I'm worried about the accuracy if we miss critical data points. How do we ensure these models are reliable?

>>Biologist: Good question! In biology, we often deal with incomplete data sets too. But by continuously updating our models with new data as it comes in—like real-time monitoring—we can improve their accuracy significantly.

>>Computer Scientist: Exactly! And in computer systems, it's all about real-time analysis and adjustments. By analyzing data packet timings dynamically, we can adjust routes to avoid congestion—kind of like how GPS helps you find the best route when driving.

>>Mathematician: To put it simply, temporal networks provide a more nuanced understanding of dynamic interactions over time.

>>Sociologist: Speaking of clear pictures, in social dynamics during a crisis, tracking how support and resources flow through communities helps identify key moments for interventions to maximize impact.

>>Electrical Engineer: Okay—but what about scalability? How do these models hold up when applied to larger systems or datasets?

>>Computer Scientist: Great point! Scalability is definitely a challenge but using distributed computing techniques allows us to handle larger datasets efficiently without losing accuracy.

>>Biologist: And in biological research—um—we use high-throughput technologies to gather massive amounts of data quickly which helps scale our models effectively. In one study I worked on...

>>Mathematician: Indeed! Theoretical frameworks behind temporal networks are designed to be scalable by nature so they adapt well even as complexity increases.

>>Sociologist: So basically—uh—the more comprehensive our data collection methods become across various fields—the better equipped we'll be at leveraging these powerful tools for deeper insights into human behavior—and beyond! 
 >>Mathematician: Um, consider this: in scale-free networks, it's best to target high-degree nodes for immunization because they're super-spreaders. But we also need ways to predict which nodes are important even if we don't have all the data.
>>Biologist: You know, during the SARS outbreak, targeting healthcare workers and frequent travelers was key since they were super-spreaders too. Focusing on them helped reduce transmission rates. Does that make sense?
>>Computer Scientist: Exactly. If we use machine learning to predict future high-degree nodes, we could target them early for immunization. This way, even with incomplete data, our strategies would be more robust and adaptive!
>>Sociologist: That's interesting! It reminds me of how we identify key influencers in social networks to spread messages effectively. By focusing on these central figures, we can disrupt misinformation or mobilize communities for positive change. Any thoughts?
>>Electrical Engineer: Right. From a systems perspective, it's crucial to consider the robustness of our immunization strategies against potential failures. In electrical terms, we often use redundancy and fail-safes to ensure reliability. Could similar principles be applied here to enhance the resilience of our immunization networks?
>>Mathematician: While targeting high-degree nodes is effective—
>>Sociologist (interrupting): Hold on—are you saying we'd need constant monitoring? How practical is that right now?
>>Mathematician (responding): Good question! Yes, constant monitoring would be ideal but challenging. We might start with periodic updates using available data sources until real-time capabilities improve.
>>Sociologist (nodding): Got it.
>>Mathematician (continuing): As I was saying... Nodes can change their degree over time due to various factors. Developing adaptive strategies that continuously update based on real-time data could significantly improve our immunization efforts.
>>Biologist: Speaking of adapting strategies, during the Ebola outbreak— 
 >>Sociologist: Alright, um, let's wrap this up. We've covered a lot today, from the theoretical foundations of network theory to its practical applications in various fields. I think it's clear that understanding social dynamics is crucial for effective implementation.

>>Mathematician: Absolutely, you've summed it up well. So, let's talk about our next steps and who will focus on what. How about the Computer Scientist takes on data flow optimization?

>>Computer Scientist: Sounds good! I'll start working on optimizing data flow using machine learning techniques. If anyone has any specific requirements or datasets they want me to consider, just let me know.

>>Biologist: Great! I'll look into how we can apply these strategies to biological networks and maybe even draw some parallels with past outbreaks like SARS and Ebola. Um, if anyone has insights or additional data that could help, please share.

>>Electrical Engineer: That makes sense. I'll focus on incorporating system robustness principles into our immunization network designs. Ensuring reliability is key here. If there are any particular areas you think need more attention, feel free to point them out.

>>Sociologist: Perfect! And I'll work on understanding and leveraging social dynamics to enhance our strategies. You know, identifying key influencers and spreading messages effectively is going to be crucial.

>>Mathematician: Excellent! Let's reconvene next week to discuss our progress and refine our approaches further based on what we've learned. Thanks again for all your hard work today."
