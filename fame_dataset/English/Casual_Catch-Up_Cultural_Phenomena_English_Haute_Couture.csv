Haute Couture,"

Haute couture (/ˌoʊt kuːˈtjʊər/ ⓘ; French pronunciation: [ot kutyʁ]; French for 'high sewing', 'high dressmaking') is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted high-end fashion design. The term haute couture generally refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the 18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern dress to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Paris became the centre of a growing industry that focused on making outfits from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of sewers—often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.[1][2] Couture translates literally from French as ""dressmaking"", sewing, or needlework[3] and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and can often refer to the same thing in spirit.[4]

In France, the term haute couture is protected by law and is defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce based in Paris. The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode is defined as ""the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses"". Their rules state that only ""those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves"" of the label haute couture.[5] The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organisation was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the ""couture"" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.[6]

In response to the Nazi occupation of Paris, more rigorous criteria for the term haute couture were established in 1945.[7] To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term haute couture in its advertising and any other way, members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture must follow specific rules:[5]

The term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion, custom-fitted clothing, whether it is produced in the fashion capitals of London, New York City, Paris, and Milan. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or fashion designers that create exclusive and often trend-setting fashions or to the fashions created. The term haute couture has also taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art and music.[8]

Haute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th century.[9] Industry and consumption were legally protected through guild statutes that required strict adherence to quality, quantity, etc. Women dressmakers, known as couturières, attained guild privileges in 1675. Their guild statutes made it so these women acquired the rights to make clothing for women and children, while male tailors retained the right to make clothing for men and boys over the age of 8. Within this empire, the couturières' work ranged from simple mending, to modes (fashions). They performed darning and alterations, and also made fine dresses of luxurious fabric for members of the royal family and aristocracy. Seamstresses were only one part of this complex network and process, and included domestic manufacture, imported products, and work alongside guilds such as the lacemakers, ribbonmakers, fashion merchants, embroiderers, pin and needle peddlers, etc.[10] Seamstresses did not operate public shops, unlike tailors, but instead relied on word of mouth and connections to procure high-end clientele.[11]

18th century France witnessed a dramatic rise in clothing consumption, and scholars have documented a ""clothing revolution"" that occurred between 1700 and 1789. This was characterised by the increased size and value of wardrobes across the country, even among the middling and working classes. The fashion industry sprang to life to meet increasing demand.[12]

Rose Bertin, the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture.[13] Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models.

As railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and dressmakers were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations.[14][citation needed]

A couturier (French: [ku.ty.ʁje]) is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture.[15] Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed.[citation needed]

The couturier Charles Frederick Worth is widely considered the father of haute couture as it is known today.[16][17] Although born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry.[2] Revolutionising how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of-a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colours and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period.

Following in Worth's footsteps were Callot Soeurs, Patou, Paul Poiret, Madeleine Vionnet, Mariano Fortuny, Jeanne Lanvin, Chanel, Mainbocher, Schiaparelli, Cristóbal Balenciaga, and Christian Dior. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers.

In the 1960s, a group of young protégés who had trained under more senior and established fashion designers including Dior and Balenciaga left these established couture houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Ted Lapidus, and Emanuel Ungaro. Japanese native and Paris-based Hanae Mori was also successful in establishing her own line.

Lacroix is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included Jean Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.[18]

For all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in ready-to-wear clothing and related luxury products such as shoes and perfumes, and licensing ventures that earn greater returns for the company. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes.[19] Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to celebrity events such as the Met Gala.[20]

Recent guest members have included the fashion houses of Cathy Pill, Gerald Watelet [fr], Nicolas Le Cauchois [fr][22] and Ma Ke (Wuyong).[23] In the 2008/2009 Fall/Winter Haute Couture week, Emanuel Ungaro showed as an Official Member.

Textiles refer to the fabric or medium being used by designers to create an article of clothing. History of silk originated in Neolithic China within the Yangshao culture (4th millennium BC), where the ""Silk worm"" was discovered. The Asian elite began using silk in high fashion. As time went on, silk began to be traded leading to the creation of the ""Silk Road"", which was a boost to China's economy.[24] The value of silk is distinguished by the form of its use, such as it being used as currency.[25] Silk fabric is composed of fibers that are produced by the silkworm mainly found in China.[25] There are various kinds of silks, used by designers in the textile world, such as dupioni, China, brocade, Jacquard, and satin silk.[26] These various kinds of silks are often used to produce certain styles of clothing. For example, Chiffon silk is used to create draping because this silk is a thinner silk than others; it allows for easier movement and flow of the fabric, thus creating an easier process for draping.[26]

Wool is the textile fiber obtained from animals such as sheep, camels, camelids, goats, or other hairy mammals.[27] Wool was first discovered and used mainly for protection against cold weather.[28] Not all types are acceptable or considered ""fine"" wool. For instance, fine wool is found only within four breeds of sheep, the other fifteen are not considered to be ""fine"".[26] Dying wool is a delicate procedure because wool easily absorbs colour, so it is important to be cautious in order not to ruin the wool.[26] Some of the higher-end wools are alpaca, angora wool, mohair, cashmere wool, camel hair, and vicuña wool; each of these wools has a different texture and softness.[26]

Haute couture, meaning 'high sewing' in French, refers to exclusive custom-fitted high-end fashion design. Originating in Paris during the mid-nineteenth century, it involves creating garments from high-quality fabrics with meticulous attention to detail. The term is legally protected in France and regulated by the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode. Historical figures like Charles Frederick Worth played a pivotal role in establishing haute couture as an art form, transforming dressmakers into fashion designers. The industry saw significant growth in the 18th century due to increased clothing consumption and contributions from designers like Rose Bertin. Modern haute couture houses include names such as Chanel and Dior, though many now focus on ready-to-wear collections for profitability. Textiles like silk and wool are essential materials used in haute couture, each with unique properties that influence garment design.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and casual greetings among participants\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Light banter to set a relaxed tone\n- Mention of the meeting objectives: build rapport, share updates, discuss non-work topics"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Haute Couture\nTLDR: Discuss the origins and evolution of haute couture\n- Fashion Historian shares insights on Charles Frederick Worth and Rose Bertin\n- Discussion on the legal protection of haute couture in France\n- Participants share thoughts on historical figures in fashion"", ""Scene 3: Modern Haute Couture Practices\nTLDR: Explore contemporary haute couture design and its challenges\n- Fashion Designer talks about current trends and practices in haute couture\n- Discussion on the shift towards ready-to-wear collections for profitability\n- Participants share personal experiences with modern fashion design"", ""Scene 4: Textiles in Haute Couture\nTLDR: Delve into the materials used in haute couture garments\n- Textile Expert explains the properties of silk, wool, and other fabrics used in high-end fashion\n- Discussion on how different textiles influence garment design\n- Participants share their favorite materials to work with or wear"", ""Scene 5: Public Perception of Haute Couture\nTLDR: Examine how haute couture is viewed by the public today\n- Fashion Journalist discusses media coverage and public interest in haute couture events like Paris Fashion Week\n- Conversation about how social media has changed public perception of high-end fashion\n- Participants share anecdotes about memorable fashion moments covered by media"", ""Scene 6: Personal Insights and Experiences\nTLDR: Share personal stories related to fashion industry experiences or interests outside work \n - Each participant shares a brief story or experience related to their role or personal life \n - Open floor for spontaneous contributions \n - Light-hearted off-topic moments encouraged"", ""Scene 7: Wrap-Up and Future Plans \n TLDR : Conclude meeting with final thoughts and future plans \n - Summarize key points discussed during the meeting \n - Discuss any upcoming projects or events participants are excited about \n - Thank everyone for their time and contributions""]",">>Fashion Journalist: Hey everyone! Ready for some updates?

>>Fashion Historian: Hi! How's everyone doing? Any exciting projects lately?

>>Fashion Journalist: So true! Those cities are epicenters of fashion innovation. Any fun stories or unexpected moments from your trips?

>>Fashion Designer: Well, there was this one moment in Milan where I stumbled upon a small workshop using 3D printing for fabrics—it was incredible! And I might have bought way too many samples...

>>Textile Expert: That sounds amazing! In Paris, I saw some groundbreaking work with biodegradable textiles—really pushing the boundaries of sustainability. 
 >>Fashion Historian: It's amazing how haute couture has evolved over centuries. From Rose Bertin's influence on Marie Antoinette's wardrobe to Charles Frederick Worth revolutionizing dressmaking, it's a testament to the enduring allure of bespoke fashion.

>>Fashion Designer: Absolutely! The intricate hand-sewn details and cutting-edge designs we see today are all about pushing boundaries while honoring tradition. Those legal protections in France really ensure that only the crème de la crème can claim the title.

>>Textile Expert: And let's not forget the materials. Luxurious fabrics like silk and fine wool played a crucial role in elevating these garments' status. It's fascinating how these materials have been woven into history, shaping fashion trends over centuries.

>>Fashion Historian: Indeed. The regulations in France help maintain quality and uniqueness, preserving haute couture's integrity and prestige.

>>Fashion Designer: The way designers today blend traditional craftsmanship with modern technology is just mind-blowing! We're seeing the future of fashion unfold right before our eyes.

>>Fashion Journalist: Speaking of historical figures, what do you think about Charles Frederick Worth's impact on haute couture?

>>Fashion Historian: Oh yes! Worth's establishment of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne in 1868 was pivotal. It set standards ensuring exclusivity and quality, preserving haute couture's essence through centuries.

>>Textile Expert: And it's not just about luxury; it's also about innovation and craftsmanship. For example, synthetic fibers like nylon and polyester revolutionized fabric production mid-20th century, allowing for more durable designs.

>>Fashion Journalist: And what about Rose Bertin? Her work with Marie Antoinette was groundbreaking!

>>Fashion Historian: Absolutely! Bertin wasn't just a dressmaker; she was a true pioneer in fashion. Her designs had a huge impact on court life and beyond.

>>Fashion Designer: Totally! The way she influenced fashion back then is still felt today. I remember using some traditional techniques inspired by her work in one of my collections—it was incredible to see how well they blended with modern elements. 
 >>Fashion Journalist: So, it's fascinating how haute couture has evolved, right? But I can't help but wonder—how does the public perceive these shifts towards ready-to-wear collections? Are we losing the essence of what makes haute couture so special?

>>Fashion Historian: It's interesting how haute couture reflects its time, don't you think? The shift towards ready-to-wear collections reminds me of the post-war era when fashion houses had to adapt. But do you think this evolution dilutes the exclusivity that haute couture once held?

>>Fashion Designer: Well, haute couture is all about pushing boundaries and creating cutting-edge designs. Ready-to-wear doesn't necessarily dilute exclusivity; it's more about making fashion accessible while maintaining high craftsmanship. We can blend tradition with modernity in exciting ways.

>>Textile Expert: From a material science perspective, it allows for exploring innovative fabrics on a larger scale while keeping quality high. Using advanced textiles like biodegradable materials and smart fabrics in both haute couture and ready-to-wear enriches the industry.

>>Fashion Historian: True, if we look back to the post-war era, fashion houses had to innovate due to economic constraints much like today. The essence of haute couture lies in evolving while maintaining core values of exclusivity and craftsmanship.

>>Fashion Designer: Exactly! Modern haute couture adapts and innovates while preserving its essence. We're using technologies like 3D printing and smart fabrics to create avant-garde yet wearable pieces. It's impressive how we push boundaries forward while honoring traditional craftsmanship.

>>Textile Expert: Absolutely! And integrating smart fabrics into haute couture isn't just about innovation; it's also about sustainability. Imagine wearing a fabric that responds to environmental changes—that's quite impressive!

>>Fashion Journalist: Public perception is crucial here. While ready-to-wear collections make fashion more accessible, there's a risk of diluting the exclusivity that haute couture represents. Balancing accessibility and exclusivity shapes public opinion significantly.

>>Fashion Historian: Yes! Haute couture has always mirrored societal changes. If we consider the post-war era again, fashion houses had to innovate due to economic constraints much like today. History really does repeat itself.

>>Fashion Designer: Right! And that's why modern haute couture's ability to adapt is so beautiful. Using technologies like 3D printing lets us create avant-garde yet wearable pieces without losing touch with traditional craftsmanship.

>>Textile Expert: Exactly! The integration of smart fabrics into haute couture isn't just innovation for innovation's sake; it's about sustainability too. Imagine feeling a fabric change with your environment—that’s remarkable! 
 >>Fashion Designer: So, speaking of sustainability and innovation, I absolutely love working with silk! It's such a versatile fabric. You can create these stunning drapes and fluid movements that are just mesmerizing. And when you combine it with modern techniques like digital printing, the possibilities are endless!

>>Fashion Historian: Silk has indeed been a symbol of opulence since ancient times. The Silk Road wasn't just a trade route; it was a cultural exchange that brought silk to the forefront of fashion. But what about wool? Its versatility and warmth have made it indispensable in haute couture. I remember seeing an exhibit on Victorian-era woolen garments – the craftsmanship was incredible.

>>Textile Expert: Silk's natural shine is amazing, and its smooth texture makes it perfect for those luxurious drapes you mentioned. But let's not forget about wool! Its flexibility allows for both structured garments and soft, cozy pieces. I once worked on a project where we used wool to create a line of winter coats that were both stylish and incredibly warm.

>>Fashion Journalist: That's interesting! I hadn't thought about how wool's structure could be so versatile. Can you tell us more about any challenges you've faced when working with these materials?

>>Fashion Designer: You know what? One of my favorite materials to work with is actually a blend of silk and wool. It's like the best of both worlds! You get the luxurious sheen and drape of silk combined with the warmth and structure of wool. We did face some challenges though – getting the right balance took some trial and error.

>>Textile Expert: Absolutely! The blend leverages the best properties of both materials but finding that perfect mix can be tricky. Once, we had to adjust our machinery settings multiple times to get the blend just right for a client's bespoke collection.

>>Fashion Historian: Isn't it fascinating how these materials have shaped fashion history? For instance, during World War II, there was a shortage of silk stockings which led to innovations in synthetic fibers like nylon.

>>Fashion Designer: Speaking of blends, have you ever tried working with Tencel? It's this amazing fabric made from wood pulp that's not only sustainable but also incredibly soft and breathable.

>>Textile Expert: Oh yes! Tencel is fantastic. It offers unique textures while being eco-friendly. Plus, it's great for moisture management which makes it perfect for all kinds of garments.

>>Fashion Journalist: Tencel really seems like it's paving the way for future textiles. Can you tell us about a recent collection where you used Tencel?

>>Fashion Designer: Sure! In my latest spring collection, we used Tencel for lightweight dresses that needed to be breathable yet elegant. The feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive – they love how comfortable yet chic the pieces are.

>>Fashion Historian: Just as silk revolutionized fashion in ancient times, Tencel is paving the way for sustainable luxury today. It's exciting to think about how future generations will look back at our era's textile innovations. 
 >>Fashion Journalist: Hey everyone, how's it going? Did anyone catch the latest episode of that fashion documentary on Netflix?

>>Fashion Designer: Oh, I did! It was so good. Really got me thinking about how media coverage can create such a buzz around events like Paris Fashion Week. Remember when Dior showcased their collection in that stunning garden setting? That was incredible!

>>Fashion Historian: Yeah, that was something else. And speaking of memorable moments, wasn't it Alexander McQueen who had that holographic Kate Moss at the end of his Fall 2006 show? That blew everyone's minds.

>>Textile Expert: Oh yes, I remember that! But you know what's really changed the game? Social media. Suddenly, everyone has access to these exclusive events and can share their thoughts instantly.

>>Fashion Historian: Absolutely. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have transformed how we experience haute couture. Now we can see behind-the-scenes footage and live streams of runway shows in real-time.

>>Fashion Designer: And influencers! They're now key players in shaping public perception of haute couture. Their reach can make or break a collection's success.

>>Fashion Journalist: True, but traditional media still plays a crucial role too. Remember John Galliano's extravagant shows for Dior? They were covered extensively by fashion magazines and TV.

>>Textile Expert: Isn't it interesting how social media allows for real-time feedback on collections though? This instant interaction can influence designers' choices and even the materials they use.

>>Fashion Journalist: Speaking of memorable moments covered by the media, who could forget when Lady Gaga wore that meat dress to the MTV Awards? It sparked so much conversation about fashion as art versus shock value.

>>Fashion Designer: Exactly! And those conversations often start online now. Social media gives everyone a voice in these discussions which is both exhilarating and nerve-wracking for us designers!

>>Fashion Historian: Yes! And think about how different public perception would be without these digital innovations. The immediacy of social media has made fashion more accessible but also more scrutinized than ever before.

>>Textile Expert: Um...and don't you think this scrutiny pushes designers to innovate constantly? The pressure to stand out is immense but also drives creativity forward.

>>Fashion Journalist: Totally agree! It's amazing to see how these dynamics play out during major events like Paris Fashion Week where every detail is dissected online almost instantly. 
 >>Fashion Designer: So, speaking of Paris Fashion Week, I remember this one time when we were experimenting with a new type of fabric that was both sustainable and luxurious. It was made from recycled ocean plastics! The audience was really intrigued by the concept. Isn't that something?

>>Fashion Historian: Oh, definitely! You know, it reminds me of the opulence of the Rococo period. The garments were not just clothing but a statement of one's social standing and political allegiance. Can you imagine the sheer artistry involved in those elaborate designs?

>>Textile Expert: That's fascinating! I once worked on a project where we developed a fabric that could self-repair small tears. It felt like something out of science fiction! The material had embedded microcapsules filled with a healing agent that would activate upon damage.

>>Fashion Journalist: Wow, that's pretty cool. Speaking of innovative fabrics, I covered an event where they showcased a dress made entirely from 3D-printed materials. It was like watching fashion meet technology in real-time.

>>Fashion Designer: Oh yeah? Well, I once collaborated with a tech company to create a dress that could light up in different patterns based on the wearer's movements. It was like wearable art! The audience at the show loved it.

>>Fashion Historian: It's amazing how fashion reflects societal changes over time. Take the Victorian era, for instance. The elaborate dresses with their intricate lace and heavy fabrics weren't just about aesthetics but also about showcasing one's wealth and status.

>>Textile Expert: Right! And speaking of materials, I've been working on developing biodegradable fabrics recently. One project even involved creating textiles embedded with sensors to monitor environmental conditions—like having a living garment!

>>Fashion Journalist: That's so interesting! It's incredible how far we've come in terms of textile innovation.

>>Fashion Designer: Yeah, totally! So, I remember this one time when we were working on a collection inspired by street art. We collaborated with graffiti artists to create unique prints directly on the fabric! The energy and creativity were just off the charts.

>>Fashion Historian: Isn't it intriguing how these historical contexts still influence modern designs? For instance, during the Renaissance, clothing wasn't merely about aesthetics but also displayed one's wealth and power through intricate embroidery and luxurious fabrics.

>>Textile Expert: Exactly! And you know what? Working with those biodegradable fabrics wasn't easy; we faced challenges ensuring they maintained durability while being eco-friendly.

>>Fashion Journalist: That sounds challenging indeed. It's fascinating how technology is transforming fashion despite these hurdles.

>>Fashion Designer: Speaking of transformation, we once created fabrics that could change texture and appearance with temperature changes for our metamorphosis-inspired collection. The audience found it quite captivating! 
 >>Fashion Journalist: So, we've covered a lot today! From the evolution of haute couture to the impact of media and innovative textiles. What do you think? Any final thoughts before we wrap up?

>>Fashion Historian: Looking back at what we've talked about today, it's amazing how much history has influenced haute couture—from Rose Bertin's designs to today's focus on sustainability. Isn't it fascinating how these historical influences continue to shape our future collections?

>>Fashion Designer: Absolutely! Looking ahead, I'm really excited about our upcoming sustainable collection. We're incorporating biodegradable fabrics and collaborating with a graffiti artist for some unique prints. It's all about pushing the boundaries of cutting-edge design while staying true to our roots.

>>Textile Expert: You know, it's fascinating how these historical influences continue to shape our future collections, but what's equally interesting is how modern technology is revolutionizing textile production. We're seeing incredible advancements like self-repairing fabrics and sensor-embedded materials.

>>Fashion Journalist: Yeah, it's amazing how everything ties together. So, any exciting projects or events coming up that you're particularly looking forward to?

>>Fashion Designer: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we're working on this new collection with biodegradable fabrics and unique graffiti prints. Additionally, we're experimenting with natural dyes sourced from local plants to further reduce our environmental impact.

>>Textile Expert: And I'm thrilled about exploring more innovative textiles like self-repairing fabrics and sensor-embedded materials. The possibilities are endless!

>>Fashion Historian: Indeed! And let's not forget the importance of understanding our past as we innovate for the future. This has been really eye-opening.

>>Fashion Journalist: Definitely! Thanks everyone for your time and contributions today. This has been incredibly insightful."
