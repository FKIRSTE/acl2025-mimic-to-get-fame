Statistics,"Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. ""description of a state, a country""[1]) is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.[2] In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal"". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[3]

When census data (comprising every member of the target population) cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).[4] Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a ""false positive"") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a ""false negative""). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.[4]

Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

""Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data."" - featured in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science.[5]
Statistics is the discipline that deals with data, facts and figures with which meaningful information is inferred. Data may represent a numerical value, in form of quantitative data, or a label, as with qualitative data. Data may be collected, presented and summarised, in one of two methods called descriptive statistics. Two elementary summaries of data, singularly called a statistic, are the mean and dispersion. Whereas inferential statistics interprets data from a population sample to induce statements and predictions about a population.[6][7][5]

Statistics is regarded as a body of science[8] or a branch of mathematics.[9] It is based on probability, a branch of mathematics that studies random events. Statistics is considered the science of uncertainty. This arises from the ways to cope with measurement and sampling error as well as dealing with uncertanties in modelling. Although probability and statistics was once paired together as a single subject, they are conceptually distinct from one another. The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability, meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set. Statistics serves to bridge the gap between probability and applied mathematical fields.[10][5][11]

Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. While many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is generally concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty.[12][13] Statistics is indexed at 62, a subclass of probability theory and stochastic processes, in the Mathematics Subject Classification.[14] Mathematical statistics is covered in the range 276-280 of subclass QA (science > mathematics) in the Library of Congress Classification.[15]

The word statistics ultimately comes from the Latin word Status, meaning ""situation"" or ""condition"" in society, which in late Latin adopted the meaning ""state"". Derived from this, political scientist Gottfried Achenwall, coined the German word statistik (a summary of how things stand). In 1770, the term entered the English language through German and referred to the study of political arrangements. The term gained its modern meaning in the 1790s in John Sinclair's works.[16][17] In modern German, the term statistik is synonymous with mathematical statistics. The term statistic, in singular form, is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name.[18]

When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models.

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory. Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction—inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies, they are also applied to other kinds of data—like natural experiments and observational studies[19]—for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables, among many others) that produce consistent estimators.

The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness. The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.[20]

An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort study, and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.[21] A case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating-point arithmetic. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)[22] distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)[23] described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. (See also: Chrisman (1998),[24] van den Berg (1991).[25])

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. ""The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer.""[26]: 82 

A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information,[27] while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent.[28]

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution.[29] Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.[30]

Consider independent identically distributed (IID) random variables with a given probability distribution: standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables.[31] The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but not a function of unknown parameters. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters. Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include sample mean, unbiased sample variance and sample covariance.

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot. Widely used pivots include the z-score, the chi square statistic and Student's t-value.

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the method of moments, the maximum likelihood method, the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations.

Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.[32][33]

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H0, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H1, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H0 (status quo) stands in opposition to H1 and is maintained unless H1 is supported by evidence ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". However, ""failure to reject H0"" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily accept H0 but fails to reject H0. While one can not ""prove"" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a power test, which tests for type II errors.

What statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis.

Working from a null hypothesis, two broad categories of error are recognized:

Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value. A residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators, a widely used class of estimators. Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error.

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares, and these are called ""methods of least squares"" in contrast to Least absolute deviations. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non-linear least squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares, which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.[34]

Most studies only sample part of a population, so results do not fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the frequentist perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a random variable.  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed random variables. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics: this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by ""probability"", that is as a Bayesian probability.

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the p-value).

The standard approach[31] is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate, the significance level is the largest p-value that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic. Therefore, the smaller the significance level, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See criticism of hypothesis testing):

Some well-known statistical tests and procedures are:

An alternative paradigm to the popular frequentist paradigm is to use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability of the hypotheses in consideration based on the relative likelihood of the evidence gathered to obtain a posterior probability. Bayesian methods have been aided by the increase in available computing power to compute the posterior probability using numerical approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 

For statistically modelling purposes, Bayesian models tend to be hierarchical, for example, one could model each Youtube channel as having video views distributed as a normal distribution with channel dependent mean and variance

, while modeling the channel means as themselves coming from a normal distribution representing the distribution of average video view counts per channel, and the variances as coming from another distribution. 

The concept of using likelihood ratio can also be prominently seen in medical diagnostic testing.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory.[1][7] All statistical analyses make use of at least some mathematics, and mathematical statistics can therefore be regarded as a fundamental component of general statistics.[8]

Formal discussions on inference date back to the mathematicians and cryptographers of the Islamic Golden Age between the 8th and 13th centuries. Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.[36] Al-Kindi's Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages, providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding. Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis.[36]

Although the term statistic was introduced by the Italian scholar Girolamo Ghilini in 1589 with reference to a collection of facts and information about a state, it was the German Gottfried Achenwall in 1749 who started using the term as a collection of quantitative information, in the modern use for this science.[37][38] The earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt.[39] Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

The mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal, Pierre de Fermat, and Christiaan Huygens. Although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy (such as the work of Juan Caramuel), probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the 17th century, particularly in Jacob Bernoulli's posthumous work Ars Conjectandi.[40] This was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable (which concerned opinion, evidence, and argument) were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis.[41] The method of least squares was first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, though Carl Friedrich Gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in 1795.[42]

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.[43] The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics—height, weight and eyelash length among others.[44] Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment,[45] the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things.[46] Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.[47]

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset, and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher, who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance (which was the first to use the statistical term, variance), his classic 1925 work Statistical Methods for Research Workers and his 1935 The Design of Experiments,[48][49][50] where he developed rigorous design of experiments models. He originated the concepts of sufficiency, ancillary statistics, Fisher's linear discriminator and Fisher information.[51] He also coined the term null hypothesis during the Lady tasting tea experiment, which ""is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation"".[52][53] In his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as Fisher's principle[54] (which A. W. F. Edwards called ""probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology"") and Fisherian runaway,[55][56][57][58][59][60] a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway effect found in evolution.

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of ""Type II"" error, power of a test and confidence intervals. Jerzy Neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.[61]

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze big data.[62]

Applied statistics, sometimes referred to as Statistical science,[63] comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.[64][65] Theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference, as well as encompassing mathematical statistics. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments.

Statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that do not have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.

Machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms.

Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences, government, and business. Business statistics applies statistical methods in econometrics, auditing and production and operations, including services improvement and marketing research.[66] A study of two journals in tropical biology found that the 12 most frequent statistical tests are: analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-squared test, Student's t-test, linear regression, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Shannon's diversity index, Tukey's range test, cluster analysis, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and principal component analysis.[67]

A typical statistics course covers descriptive statistics, probability, binomial and normal distributions, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, linear regression, and correlation.[68] Modern fundamental statistical courses for undergraduate students focus on correct test selection, results interpretation, and use of free statistics software.[67]

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models (such as neural networks) as well as the creation of new types, such as generalized linear models and multilevel models.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling, such as permutation tests and the bootstrap, while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on ""experimental"" and ""empirical"" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as Mathematica, SAS, SPSS, and R.

In business, ""statistics"" is a widely used management- and decision support tool. It is particularly applied in financial management, marketing management, and production, services and operations management.[69][70] Statistics is also heavily used in management accounting and auditing. The discipline of Management Science formalizes the use of statistics, and other mathematics, in business. (Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships.)

A typical ""Business Statistics"" course is intended for business majors, and covers[71] descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability (typically the binomial and normal distributions), test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, linear regression, and correlation; (follow-on) courses may include forecasting, time series, decision trees, multiple linear regression, and other topics from business analytics more generally. Professional certification programs, such as the CFA, often include topics in statistics.

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: biostatistics, computational biology, computational sociology, network biology, social science, sociology and social research. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology. These disciplines include:

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in statistical process control or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions.

Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.[72] A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book How to Lie with Statistics,[72] by Darrell Huff, outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).[73]

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias.[74] Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.[75] Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.[74] Most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented.[75] To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.[76] According to Huff, ""The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.""[77]

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:[72]

The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death, might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables.

It was noted that statistics begins with a statistical population or model to be studied and deals with every aspect of data collection planning through surveys and experiments. When full census data cannot be collected, representative sampling is used to extend conclusions from samples to populations. Two main methods in data analysis were highlighted: descriptive statistics, which summarize sample data using indexes like mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions subject to random variation. The importance of hypothesis testing was discussed, including Type I and Type II errors. Statistical measurement processes are prone to errors such as random noise or systematic bias. Techniques have been developed to address issues like missing data or censoring. The historical development of statistics was reviewed, noting contributions from figures like Francis Galton and Karl Pearson in transforming it into a rigorous mathematical discipline. Modern applications span various fields including government, business, natural sciences, and social sciences. The misuse of statistics can lead to serious errors in decision-making; thus proper application and interpretation are crucial for reliable results.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants to set a collaborative tone.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick acknowledgment of familiarity\n- Brief overview of meeting objectives"", ""Scene 2: Aligning on Project Objectives\nTLDR: Discuss shared project goals and ensure alignment across departments.\n- Statistician outlines key statistical methods relevant to the project\n- Data Scientist shares practical applications and insights from data analysis\n- Educator simplifies complex concepts for clarity"", ""Scene 3: Resolving Interdepartmental Issues\nTLDR: Address any existing issues between departments and find resolutions.\n- Open floor for participants to voice concerns or challenges\n- Collaborative problem-solving session led by Statistician, Data Scientist, and Educator\n- Encourage spontaneous contributions and personal experiences"", ""Scene 4: Discussion on Statistical Methods\nTLDR: Dive deeper into specific statistical techniques used in the project.\n- Statistician explains descriptive vs. inferential statistics with examples\n- Data Scientist discusses hypothesis testing and error types (Type I & II)\n- Educator provides analogies to simplify understanding"", ""Scene 5: Handling Data Collection Challenges\nTLDR: Explore strategies for effective data collection and dealing with missing data.\n- Statistician talks about planning surveys and experiments\n- Data Scientist shares techniques for handling missing data or censoring issues\n- Educator offers simplified explanations for better grasp"", ""Scene 6: Historical Context of Statistics\nTLDR: Review the historical development of statistics and its impact on modern applications.\n- Statistician highlights contributions from Francis Galton and Karl Pearson\n- Data Scientist connects historical methods to current practices in various fields\n- Educator uses storytelling to make history engaging"", ""Scene 7: Misuse of Statistics in Decision-Making\nTLDR: Discuss the importance of proper application and interpretation of statistics.\n- Statistician warns against common pitfalls in statistical analysis\n- Data Scientist shares real-world examples of misuse leading to errors in decision-making\n- Educator emphasizes critical thinking skills for reliable results"", ""Scene 8: Open Floor for Spontaneous Discussion \nTLDR: Allow participants to bring up unplanned topics or share additional insights. \n - Encourage sharing personal experiences related to statistics \n - Facilitate natural topic evolution based on participant interests \n - Allow brief off-topic moments for lighter conversation"", ""Scene 9: Closing Remarks \n TLDR : Summarize key points discussed and outline next steps .\\ n - Recap aligned objectives , resolved issues ,and collaborative efforts \\ n - Outline action items moving forward \\ n - Thank participants for their contributions""]",">>Educator: Hey everyone, great to see you all here! Let's kick things off with today's agenda.

>>Statistician: Good to see everyone! We'll be discussing some important statistical methods today.

>>Data Scientist: Sounds good! I'm particularly interested in how we can apply these methods practically.

>>Educator: Absolutely! Feel free to jump in with questions or comments as we go along.

>>Statistician: Right, let's keep this interactive. I'll start by outlining the main methods we'll discuss, then we can talk about how they apply in real-world scenarios.

>>Data Scientist: Perfect. It's crucial that we understand not just the theory but also how these methods work in practice. 
 >>Statistician: It's essential to consider both descriptive and inferential statistics for our project. Descriptive statistics will help us summarize the data we collect, while inferential statistics will allow us to make predictions and draw conclusions about the larger population from our sample.
>>Educator: Got it. So, descriptive stats give us a snapshot of our data, like averages or ranges. Inferential stats help us predict trends and understand broader implications from our sample.
>>Data Scientist: Exactly! And from a machine learning perspective, these methods are crucial for building models that can forecast trends and make informed decisions. Imagine the insights we could uncover with accurate predictions!
>>Statistician: Right. To ensure our models are robust, we need to account for potential biases in our sample. Techniques like stratified sampling can improve representativeness, and cross-validation helps assess model reliability.
>>Educator: Stratified sampling sounds like making sure every part of our dataset is represented fairly. That way, we avoid biases and get more accurate conclusions.
>>Data Scientist: Yes, and handling missing data is another key aspect. Imputation techniques can estimate missing values so that our analysis remains unbiased.
>>Statistician: Absolutely. We also need to address outliers since they can skew results significantly. Using methods like trimming or winsorizing can mitigate their effects.
>>Data Scientist: Handling outliers is crucial for model accuracy too. Techniques like isolation forests or robust scaling minimize their impact on predictions.
>>Educator: Makes sense. If one extreme event doesn't fit the overall pattern, adjusting for it ensures we reflect the true story accurately.
>>Statistician: Another important aspect is multicollinearity in predictive models. It inflates variance of coefficient estimates and makes models unstable. Variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis helps detect this issue.
>>Data Scientist: Multicollinearity really messes with models by inflating variance of coefficients and making predictions unstable. Using VIF analysis or regularization methods tackles this issue effectively.
>>Educator: In simpler terms, it's like having two variables that always move together; if we can't separate their individual impacts, it muddles understanding of results. 
 >>Statistician: I appreciate that analogy. Now, let's address the interdepartmental issues at hand. One recurring concern seems to be the communication gap between our data science and education teams. Improving this could significantly enhance our collaborative efforts.

>>Data Scientist: That's a good point about communication gaps. One practical way we could bridge this is by having regular workshops with both teams to understand each other's workflows better.

>>Educator: Workshops sound great! We could also create a shared glossary of terms and concepts to ensure we're all speaking the same language.

>>Statistician: To build on that, we could use a shared project management tool where both teams can track progress and collaborate more effectively. This would ensure transparency and accountability in our projects.

>>Data Scientist: Using visual tools can help everyone see patterns in the data clearly. It makes it easier for both teams to understand the insights from our models.

>>Statistician: Establishing regular feedback loops would allow us to continuously monitor and improve our communication strategies, ensuring any emerging issues are promptly addressed.

>>Educator: Regular joint training sessions will definitely help both teams understand each other's tools and methodologies better. This way, we can foster a more collaborative environment.

>>Statistician: Implementing a shared knowledge base where both teams can contribute and access information would ensure that everyone is on the same page and can easily find answers to common questions.

>>Data Scientist: And using data-driven decision-making frameworks can help us make more informed choices based on actual data rather than assumptions.

>>Educator: Incorporating some fun team-building activities might break the ice and foster better relationships between departments. 
 >>Statistician: Um, it's crucial to differentiate between descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics help us summarize and describe the features of a dataset, like calculating the mean or standard deviation. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, allow us to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. For instance, using hypothesis testing to determine if there's a significant difference between two groups.

>>Data Scientist: Right, from a machine learning perspective, hypothesis testing is essential for validating our models. We need to be cautious about Type I and Type II errors because they can significantly impact the reliability of our predictions. Imagine the consequences if we misinterpret these errors in a critical application.

>>Educator: Okay, let's break this down. Think about hypothesis testing like a courtroom trial. The null hypothesis is the assumption that the defendant is innocent. A Type I error happens when we wrongly convict an innocent person, while a Type II error occurs when we fail to convict a guilty one.

>>Statistician: That's an interesting analogy! When we talk about Type I and Type II errors in medical research, for example—

>>Data Scientist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—I'm curious about how these errors specifically affect medical research?

>>Statistician: Sure! A Type I error might lead us to believe a new drug is effective when it isn't, while a Type II error could result in missing out on a potentially life-saving treatment.

>>Data Scientist: Got it. And from our side in machine learning, understanding these errors helps ensure our models don't misclassify patients' health conditions—the consequences could be dire!

>>Educator: Like giving medicine unnecessarily versus not giving it when needed!

>>Statistician: Exactly! In medical research, falsely concluding that a treatment is effective can cause harm; overlooking beneficial treatments deprives patients of necessary care.

>>Data Scientist: So essentially, whether it's medical research or model validation in machine learning, minimizing these errors is crucial for reliable outcomes.

>>Educator: Absolutely. It's all about making informed decisions based on accurate data analysis.

>>Statistician: Great discussion everyone! To wrap up, let's remember that understanding and minimizing Type I and Type II errors are vital across various fields—from healthcare to technology—to ensure we're making sound decisions based on our data. 
 >>Data Scientist: Handling missing data can be tricky, but we've got some techniques like mean substitution or k-nearest neighbors that could work. Let's dive into the data and see which method fits best.
>>Statistician: Absolutely! And stratified sampling can help reduce biases from the outset. It's crucial to plan surveys and experiments carefully to ensure our data is reliable.
>>Educator: Can you explain how stratified sampling works in this context?
>>Statistician: Sure! Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups and then sampling from each group. This way, we get a more representative sample and reduce biases.
>>Data Scientist: You know, even with these methods, sometimes missing data can't be fully captured. It's important to understand why data is missing in the first place.
>>Educator: Right, addressing the root cause of missing data is crucial. If we know why it's happening, we can prevent it from occurring again.
>>Statistician: Exactly. Plus, considering when and how often we collect data can help us spot patterns of missingness early on.
>>Data Scientist: Yeah, unforeseen circumstances can still lead to gaps in our data. But understanding these patterns helps us choose the best imputation method.
>>Educator: So it's like fixing a problem at its root to prevent future issues—makes sense! 
 >>Statistician: Galton and Pearson really changed how we look at data with their work on correlation and regression. Their contributions laid the groundwork for modern statistical analysis.
>>Data Scientist: Absolutely! Their methods are still crucial in developing algorithms that can predict trends and behaviors accurately. For instance, Pearson's correlation coefficient is widely used in predicting stock market trends.
>>Educator: That's a great point about predictive modeling! How do you think their methods compare to modern techniques?
>>Statistician: Well, while their foundational work remains relevant, we've built on it significantly. Today, we use more advanced models that incorporate machine learning and AI to handle larger datasets and more complex relationships.
>>Data Scientist: Exactly. Take neural networks, for example—they're capable of identifying patterns that traditional regression analysis might miss. But understanding the basics of correlation is still essential for interpreting these models correctly.
>>Educator: It's fascinating how these historical techniques continue to be the backbone of our current methodologies. Speaking of applications, have you seen how regression analysis is used in healthcare to predict patient outcomes?
>>Statistician: Yes, that's a great example! Regression models help identify risk factors and predict recovery times based on various patient data points.
>>Data Scientist: And it's not just healthcare—these techniques are applied across industries. In marketing, for instance, companies use regression analysis to understand consumer behavior and optimize their campaigns.
>>Educator: It’s amazing how versatile these tools are. They’ve truly stood the test of time by adapting to new challenges and technologies. 
 >>Statistician: It's crucial to understand that even the most sophisticated models can lead to erroneous conclusions if misapplied. For instance, failing to account for multicollinearity or using inappropriate sampling methods can significantly skew results. The numbers don't lie, but they must be interpreted correctly.
>>Data Scientist: Absolutely! I've seen firsthand how misinterpreting statistical data can lead to disastrous decisions. For example, we once used a small sample size for predicting market trends, which led to inaccurate forecasts and financial losses. From a machine learning perspective, it's essential to validate models with robust datasets to avoid these pitfalls.
>>Educator: That's a great point about validation. When we misuse statistics, it's like trying to navigate with a faulty map. We might end up making decisions that lead us astray. Critical thinking and proper interpretation are key to ensuring our conclusions are reliable.
>>Statistician: One common pitfall is overfitting, where a model performs exceptionally well on training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This often happens when too many parameters are used without proper validation techniques.
>>Data Scientist: Yes, that's true! And it reminds me of a project where we had exactly that issue. Using cross-validation techniques helped us mitigate the problem and improve the model's performance on new data.
>>Educator: Overfitting is indeed problematic. I also think it's important to educate decision-makers about these pitfalls so they understand why robust validation is necessary.
>>Statistician: You know, one thing we often overlook is how misusing p-values can lead to wrong conclusions. Many decision-makers interpret a low p-value as definitive proof of an effect without considering the context or the possibility of Type I errors.
>>Data Scientist: Absolutely! P-values are often misinterpreted in machine learning too. Decision-makers jump to conclusions based on low p-values without considering broader context or potential errors.
>>Educator: Misinterpreting p-values is problematic. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other; we need thorough analysis before making decisions.
>>Statistician: Misuse of correlation and causation is another critical aspect. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other; this common pitfall can lead to misguided decisions if we don't carefully analyze the underlying data and context.
>>Data Scientist: I've seen decision-makers confuse correlation with causation too many times, leading to bad decisions. For instance, just because sales increase when marketing spend increases doesn't necessarily mean marketing spend directly causes higher sales!
>>Educator: Exactly! We need to dig deeper into understanding true relationships between variables rather than jumping to conclusions based on surface-level observations. 
 >>Statistician: You know, one of the most intriguing cases I encountered was during a study on hospital performance metrics. We found that hospitals with higher patient satisfaction scores also had lower readmission rates. But when we looked deeper, it became clear that staffing levels and resource availability were the real drivers behind both metrics.

>>Data Scientist: That's fascinating! In my experience with social media data, we discovered how sentiment analysis can predict customer behavior. Positive sentiment was linked to increased sales, but it turned out our marketing campaigns were influencing both.

>>Educator: Exactly! When teaching data analysis, I use real-world datasets like sales from local businesses to illustrate key concepts. For instance, we found that coffee shop sales went up on sunny days, but promotional events were actually driving those numbers.

>>Statistician: It's interesting how hidden factors can change our understanding of data. In a study on educational outcomes, schools with higher test scores also had more extracurricular activities. But parental involvement was the true driver behind both metrics.

>>Data Scientist: It’s funny how often these patterns emerge. I remember working on a telecom project where customer churn seemed linked to service outages. But poor customer service was the actual cause once we dug into the details.

>>Educator: Absolutely! It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals something new about the data. And it's crucial for students to grasp this concept early on.

>>Statistician: One of my most challenging projects involved dealing with missing data. We had to fill in gaps using different methods like k-nearest neighbors and mean substitution. It was eye-opening to see how these techniques impacted our final results.

>>Data Scientist: Oh yeah! Predicting customer churn for a telecom company showed high churn rates correlated with frequent service outages initially. But poor customer service was really driving those numbers once we controlled for satisfaction scores.

>>Educator: You know what? This reminds me of teaching students about correlation versus causation using everyday examples like ice cream sales and temperature changes—it's all about understanding what's really driving those numbers! 
 >>Statistician: Um, we've made significant progress today. We've aligned on the importance of robust validation techniques and minimizing errors, particularly Type I and Type II errors. Moving forward, we should focus on implementing these methods effectively to ensure our models are reliable across different datasets.

>>Data Scientist: Absolutely, I agree with you there! From a machine learning perspective, it's crucial that we implement these validation techniques effectively. This will help us ensure our models perform consistently across various datasets. Thanks everyone for your contributions!

>>Educator: It's been great seeing how well we've worked together to get to this point. Regular workshops, shared glossaries, and team-building activities have really helped us stay on track. Let's keep up the good work as we move forward with our action items. Thanks everyone!"
