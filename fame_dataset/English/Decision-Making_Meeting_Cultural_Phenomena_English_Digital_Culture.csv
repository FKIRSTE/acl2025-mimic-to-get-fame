Digital Culture,"Internet culture is a culture developed and maintained among frequent and active users of the Internet (also known as netizens) who primarily communicate with one another as members of online communities; that is, a culture whose influence is ""mediated by computer screens"" and information communication technology,[1]: 63  specifically the Internet.

Internet culture arises from the frequent interactions between members within various online communities and the use of these communities for communication, entertainment, business, and recreation.

Studied aspects of Internet culture include anonymity/pseudonymity, social media, gaming and specific communities, such as fandoms, and has also raised questions about online identity and Internet privacy.[2]

Increasingly widespread Internet adoption has influenced Internet culture; frequently provoking enforcing norms via shaming, censuring and censorship while pressuring other cultural expressions underground.[3]

The cultural history of the Internet is a story of rapid change. The Internet developed in parallel with rapid and sustained technological advances in computing and data communication. Widespread access to the Internet emerged as the cost of infrastructure dropped by several orders of magnitude with consecutive technological improvements.

Though Internet culture originated during the creation and development of early online communities – such as those found on bulletin board systems before the Internet reached mainstream adoption in developed countries – many cultural elements have roots in other previously existing offline cultures and subcultures which predate the Internet. Specifically, Internet culture includes many elements of telegraphy culture (especially amateur radio culture), gaming culture and hacker culture.

Initially, digital culture tilted toward the Anglosphere. As a consequence of computer technology's early reliance on textual coding systems that were mainly adapted to the English language, Anglophone societies—followed by other societies with languages based on Latin script—enjoyed privileged access to digital culture. However, other languages have gradually increased in prominence. In specific, the proportion of content on the Internet that is in English has dropped from roughly 80% in the 1990s to around 52.9% in 2018.[4][5]

As technology advances, Internet Culture continues to change. The introduction of smartphones and tablet computers and the growing computer network infrastructure around the world have increased the number of Internet users and have likewise resulted in the proliferation and expansion of online communities. While Internet culture continues to evolve among active and frequent Internet users, it remains distinct from other previously offline cultures and subcultures which now have a presence online, even those cultures and subcultures from which Internet Culture borrows many elements.

One cultural antecedent of Internet culture was amateur radio (commonly known as ham radio). By connecting over great distances, ham operators were able to form a distinct cultural community with a strong technocratic foundation, as the radio gear involved was finicky and prone to failure. The area that later became Silicon Valley, where much of modern Internet technology originates, had been an early locus of radio engineering.[6] Alongside the original mandate for robustness and resiliency, the renegade spirit of the early ham radio community later infused the cultural value of decentralization and near-total rejection of regulation and political control that characterized the Internet's original growth era, with strong undercurrents of the Wild West spirit of the American frontier.

At its inception in the early 1970s as part of ARPANET, digital networks were small, institutional, arcane, and slow, which confined the majority of use to the exchange of textual information, such as interpersonal messages and source code. Access to these networks was largely limited to a technological elite based at a small number of prestigious universities; the original American network connected one computer in Utah with three in California.[7]

Text on these digital networks usually encoded in the ASCII character set, which was minimalistic even for established English typography, barely suited to other European languages sharing a Latin script (but with an additional requirement to support accented characters), and entirely unsuitable to any language not based on a Latin script, such as Mandarin, Arabic, or Hindi.

Interactive use was discouraged except for high value activities. Hence a store and forward architecture was employed for many message systems, functioning more like a post office than modern instant messaging; however, by the standards of postal mail, the system (when it worked) was stunningly fast and cheap. Among the heaviest users were those actively involved in advancing the technology, most of whom implicitly shared much the same base of arcane knowledge, effectively forming a technological priesthood.

The origins of social media predate the Internet proper. The first bulletin board system was created in 1978,[8] GEnie was created by General Electric in 1985[9][unreliable source?], the mailing list Listserv appeared in 1986[9][unreliable source?], and Internet Relay Chat was created in 1988.[9][unreliable source?] The first official[dubious – discuss] social media site, SixDegrees launched in 1997.[9][unreliable source?]

In the 1980s, the network grew to encompass most universities and many corporations, especially those involved with technology, including heavy but segregated participation within the American military–industrial complex. Use of interactivity grew, and the user base became less dominated by programmers, computer scientists and hawkish industrialists, but it remained largely an academic culture centered around institutions of higher learning. It was observed that each September, with an intake of new students, standards of productive discourse would plummet until the established user base brought the influx up to speed on cultural etiquette.

Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia, opening the door for public participation. Soon the network was no longer dominated by academic culture, and the term eternal September, initially referring to September 1993, was coined as Internet slang for the endless intake of cultural newbies.

Commercial use became established alongside academic and professional use, beginning with a sharp rise in unsolicited commercial e-mail commonly called spam. Around this same time, the network transitioned to support the burgeoning World Wide Web. Multimedia formats such as audio, graphics, and video become commonplace and began to displace plain text, but multimedia remained painfully slow for dial-up users. Also around this time the Internet also began to internationalize, supporting most of the world's major languages, but support for many languages remained patchy and incomplete into the 2010s.

On the arrival of broadband access, file sharing services grew rapidly, especially of digital audio (with a prevalence of bootlegged commercial music) with the arrival of Napster in 1999 and similar projects which effectively catered to music enthusiasts, especially teenagers and young adults, soon becoming established as a prototype for rapid evolution into modern social media. Alongside ongoing challenges to traditional norms of intellectual property, business models of many of the largest Internet corporations evolved into what Shoshana Zuboff terms surveillance capitalism. Not only is social media a novel form of social culture, but also a novel form of economic culture where sharing is frictionless, but personal privacy has become a scarce good.
In 1998, there was Hampster Dance, the first[dubious – discuss] successful Internet meme.[10]

One early study, conducted from 1998 to 1999, found that the participants view information obtained online as slightly more credible than information from magazines, radio, and television, information obtained from newspapers was the most credible.[11] Credibility online is established in much the same way that it is established in the offline world. Lawrence Lessig claimed that the architecture of a given online community may be the most important factor in establishing credibility. Factors include: anonymity, connection to physical identity, comment rating system, feedback type (positive vs positive/negative), moderation.[12]

Many sites allow anonymous commentary, where the user-id attached to the comment is something like ""guest"". In an architecture that allows anonymous commentary, credibility attaches only to the object of the comment. Sites that require some link to an identity may require only a nickname that is sufficient to allow comment readers to rate the commenter, either explicitly, or by informal reputation.

Architectures can require that physical identity be associated with commentary, as in Lessig's example of Counsel Connect.[12]: 94–97  However, to require linkage to a physical identity, sensitive information about a user must be collected and safeguards for that collected information must be established – users must place sufficient trust in the site. Irrespective of safeguards, as with Counsel Connect,[12]: 94–97  use of physical identities links credibility across the frames of the Internet and real space, influencing the behaviors of those who contribute in those spaces. However, even purely online identities can establish credibility. Even though nothing inherently links a person or group to their Internet-based persona, credibility can be earned, because of the time required.[12]: 113 

In some architectures, commenters can, in turn, be rated by other users, potentially encouraging more responsible commentary, although the profusion of popular shitposters belies this. 

Architectures can be oriented around positive feedback or allow both positive and negative feedback. While a particular user may be able to equate fewer stars with a ""negative"" rating, the semantic difference is potentially important. The ability to actively downrate an identify may violate laws or norms.[13]

Architectures can give editorial control to a group or individual not employed by the site (e.g., Reddit), termed moderators. Moderation may take be either proactive (previewing contents) or reactive (punishing violators). 

The moderator's credibility can be damaged by overly aggressive behavior.[1]

It's great to see you all here. How's everyone doing today?  
>>Social Media Strategist: Hi there! I'm really looking forward to our discussion. So, how's everyone feeling about today's agenda?  
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Let's be clear, privacy is a fundamental right that must be protected in the digital age. For instance, the recent data breach at Company X highlights the need for robust privacy measures. We should consider implementing similar safeguards in our strategies.  
>>Digital Historian: Looking back at history, digital technologies have always evolved alongside societal changes. From ARPANET to social media, each leap brought new challenges and opportunities. What can we learn from these past experiences to help us navigate today's complexities?  
>>Digital Anthropologist: You know, it's fascinating how digital cultures have evolved over time. Each phase brings unique challenges and opportunities. How do you think these historical contexts can inform our approach to privacy and engagement?  
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Absolutely! While history provides context, adapting our strategies to comply with current privacy laws is crucial. The example I mentioned earlier shows why safeguarding personal data is paramount—what steps can we take next?  
>>Social Media Strategist: That's an interesting point you made about ARPANET and its lessons for today’s world. Building on that, how can we ensure our digital marketing strategies are engaging yet respectful of privacy concerns? That's key for us moving forward!  
>>Digital Historian: You see, the development of digital technologies has always been a double-edged sword—enabling connectivity while raising significant concerns about privacy and security. Back then, early adopters couldn't foresee today's complexities; what do you think this means for us now?  
>>Digital Communication Expert: Hmm... Digital communication has changed our daily lives—from social media to instant messaging—revolutionizing how we connect and share information. How do we balance this transformation with the need for privacy? 
 >>Alex (Digital Historian): Looking back at history, the roots of Internet culture can be traced to amateur radio and hacker communities. These early adopters fostered a spirit of innovation and decentralization that shaped online interactions. What can history teach us about maintaining this balance between freedom and regulation?

>>Jordan (Digital Anthropologist): That's a great point, Alex. Those communities were like the pioneers of cyberspace, laying down the groundwork for today's decentralized culture. It's fascinating how offline subcultures influenced the digital realm! How do you think we can keep this spirit alive in today's more regulated environment?

>>Taylor (Social Media Strategist): Building on what Jordan said, these early communities really set the stage for engagement strategies we use now. For example, viral marketing techniques have their roots in the decentralized nature of amateur radio and hacker groups. Engagement is key—how can we improve our strategies to reflect this innovative spirit?

>>Morgan (Digital Communication Expert): Absolutely, Taylor. The impact of these early communities on today's digital landscape is profound. They championed innovation and pushed traditional boundaries. How does this influence our approach to modern communication technologies?

>>Casey (Internet Privacy Advocate): While fostering innovation through decentralization is important, we must also prioritize privacy as a fundamental right. In the digital age, how can we ensure these historical influences coexist with robust privacy protections?

>>Alex (Digital Historian): Right, Casey. Amateur radio and hacker communities were instrumental in shaping Internet culture by championing freedom from regulation. How can we ensure these values persist amidst increasing digital regulations?

>>Taylor (Social Media Strategist): Exactly! The way those early communities embraced decentralization is like a blueprint for today's engagement strategies. It's all about creating content that resonates deeply with audiences! How can we harness this spirit to enhance our digital marketing efforts?

>>Morgan (Digital Communication Expert): Good point, Taylor! In today's world, their technological impact is undeniable—they laid the groundwork for a landscape where innovation thrives. Can we leverage this legacy to address current challenges in communication technology?

>>Casey (Internet Privacy Advocate): I agree with Morgan's perspective but want to emphasize that while fostering innovation through decentralization, we shouldn't compromise on privacy rights. We need ways for these historical influences to coexist with strong privacy protections.

>>Taylor (Social Media Strategist): And building on Casey's point—the sense of belonging those early communities fostered is something we should tap into for engagement optimization today. Creating spaces where people feel connected and valued could really enhance our online communities. 
 >>Digital Communication Expert: You know, smartphones have really changed how we interact online. They've made it easier for people to connect and share experiences instantly.

>>Digital Anthropologist: That's true! Smartphones have also transformed how we present ourselves online. We've created these digital personas that keep evolving with new technology.

>>Social Media Strategist: Speaking of transformation, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are driving cultural trends at lightning speed. Engagement is crucial; these platforms thrive on user interaction, shaping our digital culture in real-time.

>>Digital Historian: Historically, the rise of smartphones and social media continues the shifts started by earlier technologies like amateur radio and early Internet communities. These innovations fostered new ways of communication and community building.

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: While it's great that smartphones and social media have revolutionized our digital lives, privacy is a big concern. The amount of data collected is staggering, and we need stronger regulations to protect people's rights.

>>Digital Anthropologist: Exactly! And this shift has changed how we consume and create content. We're both the audience and performers now. How do you think this impacts our cultural norms?

>>Social Media Strategist: Good point! With everyone constantly connected through their phones, our digital culture is always changing. What can we do to make these interactions more meaningful?

>>Digital Communication Expert: Smartphones are so integrated into our lives that they're part of our cultural fabric now. They affect not just communication but also social norms and values.

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Right, but with constant connectivity comes significant privacy issues. We need to be careful about how personal information is used—and potentially misused.

>>Digital Historian: History shows us how to manage rapid changes brought by technology. Understanding past innovations helps us navigate current challenges effectively.

>>Social Media Strategist: Interesting! With smartphones driving constant connectivity, we're shaping a dynamic digital culture together. What strategies can enhance meaningful engagement?

>>Digital Anthropologist: It's fascinating how smartphones influence immediacy too—like we're always looking for the next notification or update! 
 >>Digital Communication Expert: Hmm! In today's world, the shift from English dominance online to a mix of languages is a big change. How does this affect our engagement strategies and the way we interact with different communities?
>>Social Media Strategist: Absolutely, it's a game-changer! We're no longer just targeting English-speaking audiences. We need to optimize our content for diverse linguistic groups to really connect and engage!
>>Digital Anthropologist: Yeah, it adds a lot of value culturally. But how do we navigate this new landscape without losing sight of privacy concerns?
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: That's a great point. With more languages online, ensuring data security becomes more complex. We could look into technologies like encryption or AI-driven language processing to help protect personal data across different contexts.
>>Digital Historian: You know, looking back at recent history, when social media first exploded globally, companies faced similar challenges in adapting their messages for various cultures and languages. Those lessons could be useful here.
>>Social Media Strategist: Imagine tailoring our strategies so they resonate deeply with different cultural contexts! How can we leverage this diversity to create more inclusive digital marketing campaigns?
>>Digital Anthropologist: Right, how do we make sure these diverse voices are not only heard but also integrated effectively into our strategies? Any thoughts on that?
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Well, one approach might be collaborating with local experts who understand both the cultural nuances and privacy needs specific to each region.
>>Digital Communication Expert: So how do we balance engaging diverse linguistic groups while maintaining strong privacy protections? It's quite the puzzle.
>>Social Media Strategist: Exactly! This diversity offers us unique opportunities for creating more inclusive campaigns. 
 >>Internet Privacy Advocate: The issue of anonymity isn't just about hiding who you are; it's really about protecting your privacy. Without strong privacy laws, people can be exploited or have their data misused. We need to look closely at moderation systems to make sure they don't infringe on these rights.
>>Digital Anthropologist: It's fascinating how anonymity can be both liberating and limiting, like a mask that lets us explore new identities while sometimes hiding our true selves. How do we ensure these moderation systems balance freedom without becoming too restrictive?
>>Social Media Strategist: Let's dive into the idea of moderation systems! If we optimize these systems to enhance user engagement while respecting privacy, we could create a space where users feel both safe and valued. How can we improve these systems to balance freedom and protection?
>>Digital Historian: Historically speaking, the concept of anonymity has deep roots in digital culture. Early online communities like bulletin board systems thrived on pseudonymity, allowing users to explore ideas freely without fear of repercussions. What can history teach us about balancing this freedom with the need for privacy protection?
>>Digital Communication Expert: Consider this—the technological impact of moderation systems is profound. They can either foster a safe environment or stifle creativity and expression. How do we ensure these systems adapt to evolving digital landscapes without compromising user privacy?
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: It's important to note that while moderation systems are essential for maintaining order—
[Phone rings loudly]
>>Social Media Strategist: Looks like someone's popular today! Sorry about that! As I was saying...
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: No problem at all! Any system that collects user data for moderation purposes must follow privacy laws closely and make sure this data isn't misused.
>>Social Media Strategist: Imagine if we could leverage historical insights to design moderation systems that protect privacy but also enhance user engagement. How can we integrate lessons from the past to create a balanced online environment?
>>Digital Historian: From a historical standpoint—
[Phone rings again]
>>Social Media Strategist: Alright, let's hope that's the last one!
>>Digital Historian: No worries at all! The evolution of moderation systems has always been about finding that delicate balance between freedom and control. Early online communities thrived with minimal regulation fostering creativity and open dialogue. We can learn from this by designing systems that protect privacy but also encourage innovation. 
 >>Social Media Strategist: So, let's dive into how engagement strategies can adapt amidst censorship pressures. We're trying to create viral content but have to navigate these restrictions. How can we optimize our approach to ensure maximum engagement without crossing the line?
>>Digital Anthropologist: Censorship often pushes cultural expressions underground, creating vibrant subcultures that thrive away from mainstream scrutiny. These underground movements sometimes influence mainstream trends. Have you noticed this in recent social media patterns?
>>Digital Historian: In history, we've seen authorities use censorship to control information flow, like with the printing press and radio. But people found ways around it—secretly circulating banned books or using coded language. What can we learn from these tactics for today's digital landscape?
>>Digital Anthropologist: Absolutely! When certain topics are banned, people find creative ways to discuss them indirectly—like memes carrying hidden messages or satire bypassing restrictions. It's a digital game of cat and mouse.
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Privacy is crucial even amidst censorship pressures. Without strong privacy laws, individuals are vulnerable to exploitation and misuse of their data. How do we protect user privacy while encouraging free expression?
>>Social Media Strategist: Good point on privacy! Let's think about real examples where content creators managed to engage audiences under restrictive conditions without getting flagged. What strategies did they use?
>>Digital Historian: During the era of the printing press, banned books circulated secretly and influenced public opinion profoundly. Today, similar tactics could involve using encrypted messaging apps or decentralized platforms to share content safely.
>>Digital Anthropologist: And modern parallels show that creativity flourishes under restriction—people use humor and satire effectively online to communicate ideas subtly yet powerfully.
>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Right, but we also need robust privacy protections so individuals feel safe sharing their thoughts without fear of surveillance or data misuse.
>>Digital Communication Expert: The internet's constant evolution means our communication strategies must adapt quickly. How can we leverage this change to craft engaging stories that challenge the status quo subtly yet effectively? 
 >>Internet Privacy Advocate: You know, the way our current intellectual property laws work just doesn't fit the digital age. They often lead to surveillance capitalism, where personal data gets used without us even knowing. We really need to rethink privacy laws to stop this kind of exploitation.

>>Digital Anthropologist: That reminds me of how early internet communities were all about privacy and autonomy. Back then, people were super protective of their data. How do we take that mindset and apply it to today's need for stronger privacy laws?

>>Social Media Strategist: If we focus on engagement strategies that prioritize user privacy, we can build trust and foster deeper connections. So, how can we use what we've learned from the past to find a balanced approach?

>>Digital Historian: Historically speaking, intellectual property norms have always been a balancing act between innovation and regulation.

>>Internet Privacy Advocate (interrupting): Sorry to jump in! But isn't there a risk that too much regulation could stifle creativity?

>>Digital Historian: That's a good point! Early internet communities thrived on open sharing and collaboration. What can history teach us about finding a middle ground that protects privacy while encouraging creativity?

>>Digital Anthropologist: Balancing privacy with innovation has always been tricky—like walking a fine line. How do we make sure our digital natives feel safe without holding back creativity?

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: While historical insights are valuable, our current situation demands immediate action. We need to overhaul these frameworks now to prioritize privacy rights because the way data is commodified today is different—and without strong laws, exploitation will continue.

>>Social Media Strategist: If we can optimize engagement while respecting privacy norms, we might find a way to balance innovation with protection. How can we create campaigns that not only captivate but also safeguard user data?

>>Digital Anthropologist: The evolution of internet culture has always been about keeping things vibrant yet secure. How do we ensure our digital spaces remain innovative without compromising on privacy?

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Maybe one step forward is proposing specific changes in legislation or industry standards that reflect these needs.

>>Social Media Strategist: I agree—perhaps starting with clearer guidelines for companies on how they handle user data could be effective.

>>Digital Historian: And looking at past examples where similar issues were tackled might give us some ideas on how best to implement these changes. 
 >>Digital Anthropologist: The way online communities are structured really affects how we perceive credibility. Anonymity can be freeing but also chaotic if not managed well.

>>Social Media Strategist: Let's talk about moderation systems. A balanced system can boost engagement and maintain credibility. How do we improve these systems to build trust and encourage participation?

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: We need to protect privacy online just like we do offline. Anonymity lets people speak freely, but without strong privacy laws and good moderation, it can lead to data breaches and misuse of personal info.

>>Digital Anthropologist: Balancing anonymity with credibility is key. Moderation systems should guide interactions so everyone feels heard without compromising trust.

>>Digital Historian: Early online forums showed us that community-driven moderation works well for maintaining credibility. What lessons from those days can we apply now?

>>Digital Communication Expert: Today, AI tools can enhance moderation by providing real-time monitoring and adjustments, keeping things credible while boosting engagement.

>>Social Media Strategist: Imagine using AI tools to create a dynamic moderation system that adapts in real-time to user behavior. This could help us keep engagement high while maintaining credibility. How do we make this happen?

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Sure, AI tools can help, but they must prioritize privacy protections. Without strict laws, these tools could cause more data breaches and misuse of information.

>>Digital Historian: Community-driven moderation has always been effective in maintaining standards. We should look at how early forums did it and see what we can learn for modern AI systems.

>>Digital Anthropologist: The structure of online communities shapes trust and credibility—like roads in a city guiding traffic flow. Moderation systems should direct interactions smoothly.

>>Social Media Strategist: Using AI tools for dynamic moderation sounds great, but let's ensure they're designed with privacy in mind from the start.

>>Internet Privacy Advocate: Absolutely, any AI-driven tool needs strong privacy protections built-in; otherwise, we're risking more data breaches. 
 >>Social Media Strategist: Great point! Let's make sure our engagement strategies work well and keep user data safe. How about we assign a team to develop these AI-driven tools and monitor their effectiveness?
>>Digital Anthropologist: Balancing privacy and engagement is like walking a tightrope. We need to make sure our AI tools enhance user interaction while safeguarding their data. Maybe we should have specific roles within the team focusing on different aspects, like privacy compliance and engagement optimization.
