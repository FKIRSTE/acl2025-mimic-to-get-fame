Number Theory,"Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers). 

Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory can often be understood through the study of analytical objects, such as the Riemann zeta function, that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, as for instance how irrational numbers can be approximated by fractions (Diophantine approximation).

Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics alongside geometry.  One quirk of number theory is that it deals with statements that are simple to understand but are very difficult to solve. Examples of this are Fermat's Last Theorem, which was proved 358 years after the original formulation, and Goldbach's conjecture, which remains unsolved since the 18th century. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, ""Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.""[1] It was regarded as the example of pure mathematics with no applications outside mathematics until the 1970s, when it became known that prime numbers would be used as the basis for the creation of public-key cryptography algorithms.

Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies integers and their properties, such as divisibility.[2] The integers comprise a set that extends the set of natural numbers

. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).[3][4]

Number theory is closely related to arithmetic and some authors use the terms as synonyms.[5] However, the word ""arithmetic"" is used today to mean the study of numerical operations and extends to the real numbers.[6] In a more specific sense, number theory is restricted to the study of integers and focuses on their properties and relationships such as divisibility, factorization, and primality in elementary number theory.[7][8] Traditionally, it is known as higher arithmetic.[9] By the early twentieth century, the term number theory had been widely adopted.[note 1]

Elementary number theory studies aspects of integers that can be investigated using elementary methods such as elementary proofs.[8] Analytic number theory, by contrast, relies on complex numbers and techniques from analysis and calculus.[10] Algebraic number theory employs algebraic structures such as fields and rings to analyze the properties of and relations between numbers. Geometric number theory uses concepts from geometry to study numbers.[11] Further branches of number theory are probabilistic number theory,[12] combinatorial number theory,[13] computational number theory,[14] and applied number theory, which examines the application of number theory to science and technology.[15]

The earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: Plimpton 322 (Larsa, Mesopotamia, c. 1800 BC), a broken clay tablet, contains a list of ""Pythagorean triples"", that is, integers 



(
a
,
b
,
c
)


{\displaystyle (a,b,c)}

 such that 




a

2


+

b

2


=

c

2




{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}

. The triples are too numerous and too large to have been obtained by brute force. The heading over the first column reads: ""The takiltum of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...""[16]

The table's layout suggests that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity[17]

which is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises. If some other method was used, the triples were first constructed and then reordered by 



c

/

a


{\displaystyle c/a}

, presumably for actual use as a ""table"", for example, with a view to applications.[18]

It is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; Babylonian astronomy, for example, truly came into its own many centuries later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.[19][note 2] Plimpton 322 tablet is the only surviving evidence of what today would be called number theory within Babylonian mathematics, though a kind of Babylonian algebra was much more developed.[20]

Although other civilizations probably influenced Greek mathematics at the beginning,[21] all evidence of such borrowings appear relatively late,[22][23] and it is likely that Greek arithmētikḗ (the theoretical or philosophical study of numbers) is an indigenous tradition. Aside from a few fragments, most of what is known about Greek mathematics in the 6th to 4th centuries BC (the Archaic and Classical periods) comes through either the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or references from mathematical works in the early Hellenistic period.[24] In the case of number theory, this means largely Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid.

Plato had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmētikḗ and calculation (logistikē). Plato reports in his dialogue Theaetetus that Theodorus had proven that 





3


,


5


,
…
,


17




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}},{\sqrt {5}},\dots ,{\sqrt {17}}}

 are irrational. Theaetetus, a disciple of Theodorus's, worked on distinguishing different kinds of incommensurables, and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of number systems. Aristotle further claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,[25] and Cicero repeats this claim: Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia (""They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean"").[26]

Euclid devoted part of his Elements (Books VII–IX) to topics that belong to elementary number theory, including prime numbers and divisibility.[27] He gave an algorithm, the Euclidean algorithm, for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (Prop. VII.2) and a proof implying the infinitude of primes (Prop. IX.20). There is also older material likely based on Pythagorean teachings (Prop. IX.21–34), such as ""odd times even is even"" and ""if an odd number measures [= divides] an even number, then it also measures [= divides] half of it"".[28] This is all that is needed to prove that 





2




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}

 is irrational.[29] Pythagoreans apparently gave great importance to the odd and the even.[30] The discovery that 





2




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}

 is irrational is credited to the early Pythagoreans, sometimes assigned to Hippasus, who was expelled or split from the Pythagorean community as a result.[31][32] This forced a distinction between numbers (integers and the rationals—the subjects of arithmetic) and lengths and proportions (which may be identified with real numbers, whether rational or not).

The Pythagorean tradition also spoke of so-called polygonal or figurate numbers.[33] While square numbers, cubic numbers, etc., are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers, pentagonal numbers, etc., the study of the sums of triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period (17th to early 19th centuries).

An epigram published by Lessing in 1773 appears to be a letter sent by Archimedes to Eratosthenes.[34][35] The epigram proposed what has become known as Archimedes's cattle problem; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed Pell's equation). As far as it is known, such equations were first successfully treated by Indian mathematicians. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.

Aside from the elementary work of Neopythagoreans such as Nicomachus and Theon of Smyrna, the foremost authority in arithmētikḗ in Late Antiquity was Diophantus of Alexandria, who probably lived in the 3rd century AD, approximately five hundred years after Euclid. Little is known about his life, but he wrote two works that are extant: On Polygonal Numbers, a short treatise written in the Euclidean manner on the subject, and the Arithmetica, a work on pre-modern algebra (namely, the use of algebra to solve numerical problems). Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's Arithmetica survive in the original Greek and four more survive in an Arabic translation. The Arithmetica is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form 



f
(
x
,
y
)
=

z

2




{\displaystyle f(x,y)=z^{2}}

 or 



f
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=

w

2




{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=w^{2}}

. In modern parlance, Diophantine equations are polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions are sought.

The Chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise[36] in Sunzi Suanjing (between the third and fifth centuries).[37] (There is one important step glossed over in Sunzi's solution:[note 3] it is the problem that was later solved by Āryabhaṭa's Kuṭṭaka – see below.) The result was later generalized with a complete solution called Da-yan-shu (大衍術) in Qin Jiushao's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections[38] which was translated into English in early nineteenth century by British missionary Alexander Wylie.[39] There is also some numerical mysticism in Chinese mathematics,[note 4] but, unlike that of the Pythagoreans, it seems to have led nowhere.

While Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,[40] it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an autochthonous tradition;[41] in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the eighteenth century.[42] Āryabhaṭa (476–550 AD) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences 



n

a

{\displaystyle n\equiv a_{1}{\bmod {m}}_{1}}

,

{\displaystyle n\equiv a_{2}{\bmod {m}}_{2}}

 could be solved by a method he called kuṭṭaka, or pulveriser;[43] this is a procedure close to (a generalization of) the Euclidean algorithm, which was probably discovered independently in India.[44] Āryabhaṭa seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations.[40]

Brahmagupta (628 AD) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations—in particular, the misnamed Pell equation, in which Archimedes may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the chakravala, or ""cyclic method"") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in Bhāskara II's Bīja-gaṇita (twelfth century).[45]

Indian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century;[46] Brahmagupta and Bhāskara's work was translated into English in 1817 by Henry Colebrooke.[47]

In the early ninth century, the caliph al-Ma'mun ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the Sindhind, which may[48] or may not[49] be Brahmagupta's Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta).
Diophantus's main work, the Arithmetica, was translated into Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820–912).
Part of the treatise al-Fakhri (by al-Karajī, 953 – c. 1029) builds on it to some extent. According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karajī's contemporary Ibn al-Haytham knew[50] what would later be called Wilson's theorem.

Other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci—who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople—no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus' Arithmetica.[51]

Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665) never published his writings but communicated through correspondence instead. Accordingly, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes.[52] Although he drew inspiration from classical sources, in his notes and letters Fermat scarcely wrote any proofs—he had no models in the area.[53]

Over his lifetime, Fermat made the following contributions to the field:

The interest of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) in number theory was first spurred in 1729, when a friend of his, the amateur[note 7] Goldbach, pointed him towards some of Fermat's work on the subject.[64][65] This has been called the ""rebirth"" of modern number theory,[66] after Fermat's relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries' attention for the subject.[67] Euler's work on number theory includes the following:[68]

Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) was the first to give full proofs of some of Fermat's and Euler's work and observations; for instance, the four-square theorem and the basic theory of the misnamed ""Pell's equation"" (for which an algorithmic solution was found by Fermat and his contemporaries, and also by Jayadeva and Bhaskara II before them.) He also studied quadratic forms in full generality (as opposed to 



m

X

2


+
n

Y

2




{\displaystyle mX^{2}+nY^{2}}

), including defining their equivalence relation, showing how to put them in reduced form, etc.

Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity. He also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He gave a full treatment of the equation 



a

x

y

z

{\displaystyle ax^{2}+by^{2}+cz^{2}=0}

[79] and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.[80] In his old age, he was the first to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for 



n
=
5


{\displaystyle n=5}

 (completing work by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and crediting both him and Sophie Germain).[81]

Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) worked in a wide variety of fields in both mathematics and physics including number theory, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, magnetism, astronomy and optics. The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801), which he wrote three years earlier when he was 21, had an immense influence in the area of number theory and set its agenda for much of the 19th century. Gauss proved in this work the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation (congruences) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.[82] The last section of the Disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory:

The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong by itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.[83]
In this way, Gauss arguably made forays towards Évariste Galois's work and the area algebraic number theory.

Starting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:

Algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy, but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (1837),[85][86] whose proof introduced L-functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.[87] The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually goes back to Euler (1730s),[88][89] who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of complex analysis in number theory comes later: the work of Bernhard Riemann (1859) on the zeta function is the canonical starting point;[90] Jacobi's four-square theorem (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory (modular forms).[91]

The American Mathematical Society awards the Cole Prize in Number Theory. Moreover, number theory is one of the three mathematical subdisciplines rewarded by the Fermat Prize.

Elementary number theory deals with the topics in number theory by means of basic methods in arithmetic.[4] Topics studied in elementary number theory are divisibility and congruences, as well as Diophantine equations, continued fraction, integer partitions, and Diophantine approximations.[92][93]

Arithmetic is the study of numerical operations and investigates how numbers are combined and transformed using the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, extraction of roots, and logarithms. Multiplication, for instance, is an operation that combines two numbers, referred to as factors, to form a single number, termed the product, such as 



2
×
3
=
6


{\displaystyle 2\times 3=6}

.[94]

Divisibility is a property between two nonzero integers related to division. An integer 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is said to be divisible by a divisor 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 if 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is a multiple of 



m


{\displaystyle m}

; that is, if there exists an integer 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 such that 



n
=
k
m


{\displaystyle n=km}

. An equivalent formulation is that 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 divides 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 and is denoted by a vertical bar, which in this case is 



m

|

n


{\displaystyle m|n}

. A common divisor of several nonzero integers is an integer that divides all of them. The greatest common divisor (gcd) is the largest of such divisors. A prime number is an integer greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and the prime itself. There are infinitely many prime numbers. A positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.[95]

Factorization is a method of expressing a number as a product. Specifically in number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of an integer into a product of integers. The unique factorization theorem is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that relates to prime factorization, integer factorization into a product of prime numbers. The theorem states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. For example, 



120


{\displaystyle 120}

 is expressed uniquely as 



2
×

{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 3\times 5}

 or simply

{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 3\times 5}

.[96]

Modular arithmetic works with finite sets of integers. A congruence of two integers 



a
,
b


{\displaystyle a,b}

 modulo 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is a relation whereby 



n

|

(
a
−
b
)


{\displaystyle n|(a-b)}

 is true. This written as 



a
≡
b


(
mod

n
)



{\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}}

, where 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 is said to be congruent to 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 modulo 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. Performing Euclidean division on both 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, and on 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

, yields the same remainder.[97]

More specifically, elementary number theory works with elementary proofs, a term that excludes the use of complex numbers but may include basic analysis.[92] For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg.[98] The term is somewhat ambiguous. For example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems, such as Wiener–Ikehara, are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary despite using Fourier analysis, not complex analysis. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a more advanced proof.

Number theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, many of the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.[99]

Analytic number theory may be defined

Some subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory (e.g., sieve theory) are better covered by the second rather than the first definition.[note 8] Small sieves, for instance, use little analysis and yet still belong to analytic number theory.[note 9]

The following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture, the twin prime conjecture, the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures, the Waring problem and the Riemann hypothesis. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, automorphic forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.[101]

One may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.[102] This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.[103]

An algebraic number is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation 



f
(
x
)
=
0


{\displaystyle f(x)=0}

 with rational coefficients; for example, every solution 



x

{\displaystyle x^{5}+(11/2)x^{3}-7x^{2}+9=0}

 is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields, or shortly number fields. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields.[104]

It could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields, namely quadratic fields, were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in Disquisitiones Arithmeticae can be restated in terms of ideals and
norms in quadratic fields. (A quadratic field consists of all
numbers of the form 



a
+
b


d




{\displaystyle a+b{\sqrt {d}}}

, where




a


{\displaystyle a}

 and 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 are rational numbers and 



d


{\displaystyle d}


is a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)
For that matter, the eleventh-century chakravala method amounts—in modern terms—to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither Bhāskara nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.

The grounds of the subject were set in the late nineteenth century, when ideal numbers, the theory of ideals and valuation theory were introduced; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorization in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals
and

are irreducible, and thus, in a naïve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by Kummer) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,[105] that is, generalizations of quadratic reciprocity.

Number fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field L is said to be an extension of a field K if L contains K.
(For example, the complex numbers C are an extension of the reals R, and the reals R are an extension of the rationals Q.)
Classifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions—that is, extensions L of K such that the Galois group[note 10] Gal(L/K) of L over K is an abelian group—are relatively well understood.
Their classification was the object of the programme of class field theory, which was initiated in the late nineteenth century (partly by Kronecker and Eisenstein) and carried out largely in 1900–1950.

An example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is Iwasawa theory. The Langlands program, one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.

The central problem of Diophantine geometry is to determine when a Diophantine equation has integer or rational solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.

For example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation or system of equations in two or more variables defines a curve, a surface, or some other such object in n-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any rational points (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or
integral points (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is whether there are finitely
or infinitely many rational points on a given curve or surface.

Consider, for instance, the Pythagorean equation 




x

2


+

y

2


=
1


{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}

. One would like to know its rational solutions, namely 



(
x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle (x,y)}

 such that x and y are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions
to 




a

2


+

b

2


=

c

2




{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}

; any solution to the latter equation gives us a solution 



x
=
a

/

c


{\displaystyle x=a/c}

, 



y
=
b

/

c


{\displaystyle y=b/c}

 to the former. It is also the
same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve described by 




x

2


+

y

2


=
1


{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}

 (a circle of radius 1 centered on the origin).

The rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves is felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve (that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation 



f
(
x
,
y
)
=
0


{\displaystyle f(x,y)=0}

, where 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 is a polynomial in two variables) depends crucially on the genus of the curve.[note 11] A major achievement of this approach is Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, for which other geometrical notions are just as crucial.

There is also the closely linked area of Diophantine approximations: given a number 



x


{\displaystyle x}

, determine how well it can be approximated by rational numbers. One seeks approximations that are good relative to the amount of space required to write the rational number: call 



a

/

q


{\displaystyle a/q}

 (with 



gcd
(
a
,
q
)
=
1


{\displaystyle \gcd(a,q)=1}

) a good approximation to 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 if 




|

x
−
a

/

q

|

<


1

q

c






{\displaystyle |x-a/q|<{\frac {1}{q^{c}}}}

, where 



c


{\displaystyle c}

 is large. This question is of special interest if 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is an algebraic number. If 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 cannot be approximated well, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of height) are critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in transcendental number theory: if a number can be approximated better than any algebraic number, then it is a transcendental number. It is by this argument that π and e have been shown to be transcendental.

Diophantine geometry should not be confused with the geometry of numbers, which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. Arithmetic geometry is a contemporary term for the same domain covered by Diophantine geometry, particularly when one wishes to emphasize the connections to modern algebraic geometry (for example, in Faltings's theorem) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.

The areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, although algorithms in number theory have a long history, the modern study of computability began only in the 1930s and 1940s, while computational complexity theory emerged in the 1970s.

Probabilistic number theory starts with questions such as the following: Take an integer n at random between one and a million. How likely is it to be prime? (this is just another way of asking how many primes there are between one and a million). How many prime divisors will n have on average? What is the probability that it will have many more or many fewer divisors or prime divisors than the average?

Much of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually independent. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.

It is sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than 



0


{\displaystyle 0}

 must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.

At times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of heuristic algorithms and open problems, notably Cramér's conjecture.

Combinatorics in number theory starts with questions like the following: Does a fairly ""thick"" infinite set 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 contain many elements in arithmetic progression:

{\displaystyle a+b,a+2b,a+3b,\ldots ,a+10b}

? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of

?

These questions are characteristic of arithmetic combinatorics, a coalescing field that subsumes additive number theory (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares), some of the geometry of numbers, as well as some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with ergodic theory, finite group theory, model theory, and other fields.

The term additive combinatorics is also used; however, the sets

 being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative groups, for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of rings, in which case the growth of

While the word algorithm goes back only to certain readers of al-Khwārizmī, careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics—ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese—whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.

An early case is that of what is now called the Euclidean algorithm. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in Elements, together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation 



a
x
+
b
y
=
c


{\displaystyle ax+by=c}

, or, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the Chinese remainder theorem) it first appears in the works of Āryabhaṭa (fifth to sixth centuries) as an algorithm called kuṭṭaka (""pulveriser""), without a proof of correctness.

There are two main questions: ""Can this be computed?"" and ""Can it be computed rapidly?"" Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. Fast algorithms for testing primality are now known, but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.

The difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for encrypting messages (for example, RSA) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.

Some things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to Hilbert's tenth problem, that there is no Turing machine which can solve all Diophantine equations.[106] In particular, this means that, given a computably enumerable set of axioms, there are Diophantine equations for which there is no proof, starting from the axioms, of whether the set of equations has or does not have integer solutions. (i.e., Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. It cannot be proven that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)

For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of mathematics other than the use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.[107] In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.[108] The number-theorist Leonard Dickson (1874–1954) said ""Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application"". Such a view is no longer applicable to number theory.[109]

This vision of the purity of number theory was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public-key cryptography algorithms.[110] Schemes such as RSA are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors.[111] These applications have led to significant study of algorithms for computing with prime numbers, and in particular of primality testing, methods for determining whether a given number is prime. Prime numbers are also used in computing for checksums, hash tables, and pseudorandom number generators.

In 1974, Donald Knuth said ""virtually every theorem in elementary number theory arises in a natural, motivated way in connection with the problem of making computers do high-speed numerical calculations"".[112]
Elementary number theory is taught in discrete mathematics courses for computer scientists. It also has applications to the continuous in numerical analysis.[113]

Number theory has now several modern applications spanning diverse areas such as:

[...] the question ""how was the tablet calculated?"" does not have to have the same answer as the question ""what problems does the tablet set?"" The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems (Robson 2001, p. 202).
Robson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 (who had to ""work for a living"", and would not have belonged to a ""leisured middle class"") could have been motivated by his own ""idle curiosity"" in the absence of a ""market for new mathematics"".(Robson 2001, pp. 199–200)

[26] Now there are an unknown number of things. If we count by threes, there is a remainder 2; if we count by fives, there is a remainder 3; if we count by sevens, there is a remainder 2. Find the number of things. Answer: 23.

Method: If we count by threes and there is a remainder 2, put down 140. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 3, put down 63. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 2, put down 30. Add them to obtain 233 and subtract 210 to get the answer. If we count by threes and there is a remainder 1, put down 70. If we count by fives and there is a remainder 1, put down 21. If we count by sevens and there is a remainder 1, put down 15. When [a number] exceeds 106, the result is obtained by subtracting 105.
[36] Now there is a pregnant woman whose age is 29. If the gestation period is 9 months, determine the sex of the unborn child. Answer: Male.

Method: Put down 49, add the gestation period and subtract the age. From the remainder take away 1 representing the heaven, 2 the earth, 3 the man, 4 the four seasons, 5 the five phases, 6 the six pitch-pipes, 7 the seven stars [of the Dipper], 8 the eight winds, and 9 the nine divisions [of China under Yu the Great]. If the remainder is odd, [the sex] is male and if the remainder is even, [the sex] is female.
This is the last problem in Sunzi's otherwise matter-of-fact treatise.

Two of the most popular introductions to the subject are:

Hardy and Wright's book is a comprehensive classic, though its clarity sometimes suffers due to the authors' insistence on elementary methods (Apostol 1981).
Vinogradov's main attraction consists in its set of problems, which quickly lead to Vinogradov's own research interests; the text itself is very basic and close to minimal. Other popular first introductions are:

For example, Fermat's Last Theorem, which remained unsolved for centuries, was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994 using sophisticated techniques from algebraic geometry. This breakthrough not only solved a long-standing problem but also demonstrated the deep connections between different branches of mathematics.
>>Historian of Mathematics: Well, in the grand scheme of things, Brahmagupta and Āryabhaṭa made quite remarkable contributions to number theory! Brahmagupta's work on quadratic equations and Āryabhaṭa's method for solving simultaneous congruences laid foundational principles that continue to influence modern mathematics.
>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Actually, we must ponder the implications of these historical contributions to number theory. The work of figures like Euclid and Brahmagupta not only laid the groundwork for modern mathematics but also raises profound questions about the nature of mathematical truth and existence. How do these ancient methods continue to shape our understanding of abstract concepts today?
>>Mathematician: Building on what was said earlier, Euler and Gauss made significant contributions in quadratic reciprocity and modular arithmetic that have profoundly influenced modern number theory.

 >>Mathematician: Let's consider this from another angle. The Riemann zeta function encodes properties of prime numbers and their distribution. By analyzing its zeros, we can gain insights into the behavior of primes, which leads us to deeper understanding in both theoretical and applied contexts.
>>Historian of Mathematics: Bernhard Riemann first introduced the zeta function in 1859, laying the foundation for much of modern analytic number theory. It's fascinating how such a concept has influenced centuries of mathematical thought!

>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Analytic number theory not only helps us understand primes but also raises interesting questions about how abstract concepts impact our understanding of mathematics.
>>Cryptographer: Computational number theory is crucial for cryptography, especially when it comes to prime factorization and modular arithmetic. These methods ensure the security of our communication systems by making it computationally infeasible to break encryption without the correct keys.

>>Cryptographer: In terms of security, computational methods are indispensable for cryptography—prime factorization and modular arithmetic form the backbone of encryption algorithms.
>>Mathematician: Probabilistic number theory offers fascinating insights into prime distribution by examining likelihoods rather than deterministic methods. 
 >>Computer Scientist: Let's look at this from an algorithmic perspective. Using probabilistic methods for prime testing can really boost our cryptographic applications.

>>Historian of Mathematics: Euclid's algorithm has been a cornerstone since ancient times. Understanding these historical methods can help us improve efficiency today.

>>Mathematician: Prime factorization is crucial for developing strong encryption methods, which are essential for secure data transmission.

>>Educator: If we integrate number theory into our encryption strategies, our cybersecurity team could work closely with computer science to develop more secure algorithms.

>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Number theory offers deep insights that go beyond just technical solutions. It can enrich our approach to these problems in meaningful ways.

>>Cryptographer: Applying number theory effectively will definitely strengthen our data security measures across all departments.

>>Historian of Mathematics: The Chinese remainder theorem, developed centuries ago, can be applied today to synchronize data across different systems. This kind of collaboration could lead to innovative solutions!

>>Mathematician: Right! Prime factorization is indeed pivotal for robust encryption methods. Aligning our objectives allows us to leverage these principles effectively.

>>Educator: Great point! Integrating number theory means the cybersecurity team and computer science department could collaborate on more secure algorithms, benefiting both departments.

>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Let's consider how number theory's abstract nature provides profound insights into mathematical truths and fosters collaboration between departments. 
 >>Computer Scientist: Um, in terms of algorithms, how can we ensure that our computational methods for prime testing are efficiently integrated across departments to enhance both security and efficiency?
>>Cryptographer: You know, the real issue here is the lack of coordination between our departments when implementing cryptographic algorithms. We need a standardized protocol to ensure everyone is on the same page; otherwise, we're just creating vulnerabilities.
>>Historian of Mathematics: The lack of coordination reminds me of how ancient mathematicians worked independently but their contributions eventually converged. Maybe we need a similar approach—standardized protocols that allow for independent innovation while ensuring overall coherence.
>>Educator: Great point! Let's break this down... We need clear communication channels between departments. Regular interdepartmental meetings or shared documentation could help.
>>Mathematician: Absolutely. But we also need to address technical discrepancies that arise when different departments use varied computational methods for prime testing. This inconsistency can lead to vulnerabilities in our encryption systems.
>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Historical examples like Euclid's algorithm show us that standardized protocols can foster innovation while maintaining coherence. How do we ensure these protocols are flexible enough to accommodate each department's unique needs?
>>Educator: Regular interdepartmental meetings sound solid. But let's also consider creating a shared digital platform where all departments can collaborate in real-time. This way, any issues or discrepancies can be addressed immediately.
>>Mathematician: In theory, establishing standardized protocols is essential, but they must be adaptable to the unique computational methods each department employs. This flexibility will help mitigate technical discrepancies and enhance overall system security.
>>Computer Scientist: Right! And um... if we integrate these protocols effectively, it could streamline our processes and reduce potential vulnerabilities.
>>Cryptographer: Exactly! We can't afford any gaps in our security framework due to miscommunication or inconsistent methodologies.
>>Philosopher of Mathematics: Well said! It's crucial that our approach remains dynamic and adaptable while maintaining rigorous standards. 
 >>Historian of Mathematics: You see, the historical evolution of number theory is truly fascinating! From the Babylonians' Pythagorean triples to Euclid's algorithm and Āryabhaṭa's simultaneous congruences, each era has contributed significantly to our understanding.
