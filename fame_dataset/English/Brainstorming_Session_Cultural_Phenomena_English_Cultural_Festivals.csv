Cultural Festivals,"

A festival is an event celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect or aspects of that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship.[2]  Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.

Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they are called patronal festivals. They may also provide entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among families.[3] Attendants of festivals are often motivated by a desire for escapism, socialization and camaraderie; the practice has been seen as a means of creating geographical connection, belonging and adaptability.[4][5]

The word ""festival"" was originally used as an adjective from the late fourteenth century, deriving from Latin via Old French.[6] In Middle English, a ""festival dai"" was a religious holiday.[7]

The first recorded used of the word ""festival"" as a noun was in 1589 (as ""Festifall"").[6] Feast first came into usage as a noun c. 1200,[8] and its first recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.[9]

The word gala comes from Arabic word khil'a, meaning robe of honor.[10] The word gala was initially used to describe ""festive dress"", but came to be a synonym of ""festival"" starting in the 18th century.[11]

Festivals have long been significant in human culture and history and are found in virtually all cultures.[12][13] The importance of festivals, to the present, is found in private and public; secular and religious life.[14] Ancient Greek and Roman societies relied heavily upon festivals, both communal and administrative.[15] Saturnalia was likely influential to Christmas and Carnival.[16] Celebration of social occasions, religion and nature were common.[16] Specific festivals have century-long histories and festivals in general have developed over the last few centuries – some traditional festivals in Ghana, for example, predate European colonisation of the 15th century.[5][16][17] Festivals prospered following the Second World War.[16] Both established in 1947, Avignon Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe have been notable in shaping the modern model of festivals.[18] Art festivals became more prominent by the turn of the 21st century.[14] In modern times, festivals are offered to public as a global tourist prospect although they are commonly public or not-for-profit.[19][20]

Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. The most important religious festivals such as Christmas, Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, Holi, Eid-al-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha serve to mark out the year. Others, such as harvest festivals, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. An early example is the festival established by Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses III celebrating his victory over the Libyans.[21] In many countries, royal holidays commemorate dynastic events just as agricultural holidays are about harvests. Festivals are often commemorated annually.

There are numerous types of festivals in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to ""feasting"") and they bring people together. Festivals are also strongly associated with national holidays. Lists of national festivals are published to make participation easier.[22]

The scale of festivals varies; in location and attendance, they may range from a local to national level.[23][16] Music festivals, for example, often bring together disparate groups of people, such that they are both localised and global.[24] The ""vast majority"" of festivals are, however, local, modest and populist.[25] The abundance of festivals significantly hinders quantifying the total there of.[14] There exists significant variation among festivals, beyond binary dichotomies of sacred and secular, rural and urban, people and establishment.[25]

Among many religions, a feast is a set of celebrations in honour of God or gods.[26] A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as Passover, Easter, and Eid al-Adha are moveable feasts – that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The Sed festival, for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian pharaoh's rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.[27] Among the Ashantis, most of their traditional festivals are linked to gazette sites which are believed to be sacred with several rich biological resources in their pristine forms. Thus, the annual commemoration of the festivals helps in maintaining the buoyancy of the conserved natural site, assisting in biodiversity conservation.[28]

In the Christian liturgical calendar, there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection (Easter), but minor festivals in honour of local patron saints are celebrated in almost all countries influenced by Christianity. In the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines. In the Philippines, each day of the year has at least one specific religious festival, either from Catholic, Islamic, or indigenous origins.[29]

Hindus celebrate many festivals, such as Navaratri, Holi, Rama Navami, Karva Chauth, Diwali, Pongal, Kartika Purnima; among others. Most Hindu festivals are not celebrated by all Hindus.[30]: 226–227  One example of a Hindu festival is Ganesh Chaturthi, which is dedicated to the god Ganesha and is celebrated throughout India, but especially in Maharashtra.[30]: 237  During the festival, idols of the god Ganesha, traditionally made of clay, are worshipped, and on the same day or after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 or 11 days, are immersed in water.[31] The public celebration of the festival, which includes a public procession, was promoted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak as a means of asserting and celebrating a Hindu nationalist identity and to provide a sense of Hindu solidarity during the British Raj.[30]: 237–238, 698 [32]

Buddhist religious festivals, such as Esala Perahera are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.[33] The Sikh community celebrates the Vaisakhi festival marking the new year and birth of the Khalsa.[34]

Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as science festivals, literary festivals and music festivals.[35]  Sub-categories include comedy festivals, rock festivals, jazz festivals and buskers festivals; poetry festivals,[36] theatre festivals, and storytelling festivals; and re-enactment festivals such as Renaissance fairs. In the Philippines, aside from numerous art festivals scattered throughout the year, February is known as national arts month, the culmination of all art festivals in the entire archipelago.[37] The modern model of music festivals began in the 1960s-70s and have become a lucrative global industry.[4] Predecessors extend back to the 11th century and some, such as the Three Choirs Festival, remain to this day.[38]

Film festivals involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the most significant film festivals include the Berlin International Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival.

A food festival is an event celebrating food or drink. These often highlight the output of producers from a certain region. Some food festivals are focused on a particular item of food, such as the National Peanut Festival in the United States, or the Galway International Oyster Festival in Ireland. There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous Oktoberfest in Germany for beer. Many countries hold festivals to celebrate wine. One example is the global celebration of the arrival of Beaujolais nouveau, which involves shipping the new wine around the world for its release date on the third Thursday of November each year.[39][40] Both Beaujolais nouveau and the Japanese rice wine sake are associated with harvest time. In the Philippines, there are at least two hundred festivals dedicated to food and drinks.[citation needed]

Seasonal festivals, such as Beltane, are determined by the solar and the lunar calendars and by the cycle of the seasons, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a wide range of ancient and modern harvest festivals. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal inundation caused by the Nile River, a form of irrigation, which provided fertile land for crops.[41] In the Alps, in autumn the return of the cattle from the mountain pastures to the stables in the valley is celebrated as Almabtrieb. A recognized winter festival, the Chinese New Year, is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day of the second new moon after the winter solstice. Dree Festival of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.[42]

Midsummer or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the feast day of a Christian saint as well as a celebration of the time of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, where it is particularly important in Sweden. Winter carnivals also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice. In the Philippines, each day of the year has at least one festival dedicated to harvesting of crops, fishes, crustaceans, milk, and other local goods.[citation needed]

Scholarly literature notes that festivals functionally disseminate political values and meaning, such as ownership of place, which undergoes transformation in accordance with the festival.[5][25] Furthermore, a festival may act as an artefact which allows citizens to achieve ""certain ideals"", including those of identity and ideology.[43] Festivals may be used to rehabilitate or elevate the image of a city; the ephemerality of festivals means that their impact is often incorporeal, of name, memory and perception.[14][25] In deviating from routine, festivals may reinforce the convention, be it social, cultural or economic.[16][25]

Festivals are recognized as events that celebrate religious, cultural, or agricultural aspects, often marked by holidays and communal gatherings. They serve purposes such as commemoration, entertainment, and education about traditions, fostering unity through shared experiences. The etymology of 'festival' traces back to Latin origins, evolving over centuries to encompass various forms of celebration.

Historically, festivals have played crucial roles in societies like Ancient Greece and Rome, influencing modern celebrations such as Christmas and Carnival. The post-World War II era saw a proliferation of festivals with notable examples like the Avignon Festival shaping contemporary models. Religious festivals remain prominent globally, marking significant events across Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism among others.

Modern festivals include arts-focused events like music and film festivals which have become lucrative industries. Food and beverage festivals celebrate regional produce while seasonal festivals align with natural cycles. Festivals also serve political functions by disseminating values and transforming perceptions of places. Despite their ephemeral nature, they reinforce social conventions and contribute to identity formation within communities.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the brainstorming session.\n- Quick greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Encouragement for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Significance of Cultural Festivals\nTLDR: Discussing the importance of cultural festivals in community life and historical contexts.\n- Cultural Anthropologist shares insights on historical significance\n- Event Organizer discusses logistical aspects of modern festivals\n- Music Festival Curator highlights artistic elements"", ""Scene 3: Types of Festivals\nTLDR: Exploring various types of festivals and their unique characteristics.\n- Religious festivals overview by Cultural Anthropologist\n- Harvest and seasonal festivals insights from Event Organizer\n- Music and arts-focused festivals discussion led by Music Festival Curator"", ""Scene 4: Modern Trends in Festivals\nTLDR: Examining contemporary trends in festival organization and participation.\n- Event Organizer talks about recent changes in event planning post-pandemic\n- Music Festival Curator discusses emerging musical genres at festivals\n- Open floor for participants to share personal experiences with modern festivals"", ""Scene 5: Challenges and Opportunities\nTLDR: Identifying challenges faced by festival organizers and potential opportunities for innovation.\n- Event Organizer outlines common logistical challenges\n- Cultural Anthropologist reflects on cultural sensitivity issues\n- Music Festival Curator suggests creative solutions to enhance festival experiences"", ""Scene 6: Spontaneous Discussion Time\nTLDR: Allowing space for unplanned topics, personal anecdotes, and natural flow of conversation.\n- Participants share off-topic moments related to their experiences with festivals\n- Encouraging open-ended questions to explore new ideas"", ""Scene 7: Prioritizing Ideas for Further Exploration\nTLDR: Reviewing generated ideas and prioritizing concepts that warrant further investigation.\n- Collaborative discussion on which ideas have the most potential impact\n- Agreement on next steps for exploring prioritized concepts"", ""Scene 8: Closing Remarks and Next Steps\nTLDR: Summarizing key points discussed, outlining action items, and closing the session.\n- Recap of main ideas generated during the session\n- Assigning tasks or follow-up actions to participants""]",">>Event Organizer: Hey everyone!

 >>Cultural Anthropologist: From what I've observed, festivals often create a unique sense of community. I remember attending a harvest festival in a small village where everyone contributed to the preparations, and it felt like one big family celebration. Maybe we could focus on activities that bring people together.
>>Event Organizer: That's a great point! When I organized a music festival in a remote village, we coordinated with local farmers for parking spaces and even used their barns for storage. It was chaotic but incredibly rewarding. Any ideas on how we could use local resources creatively?
>>Music Festival Curator: Definitely! We could involve local artists for decorations. I once attended an event where they did that, and it added such a personal touch.
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Festivals can also serve as bridges between generations. At a storytelling festival I went to, elders shared ancient tales with the younger crowd, creating beautiful connections. What if we included some intergenerational activities?
>>Music Festival Curator: That sounds amazing! Imagine blending traditional folk music with modern electronic beats. I curated a lineup for a mountain festival once, and the fusion of genres created an electrifying atmosphere.
>>Event Organizer: Speaking of blending elements, how about incorporating natural themes? Like at the cherry blossom festival in Japan where the whole community came together to appreciate nature's beauty.
>>Cultural Anthropologist: Yes! Nature can really unify people. And speaking of unity, weather can be unpredictable—remember that food festival where unexpected rain turned into a cozy event under tents? We should definitely have contingency plans.
>>Music Festival Curator: Good call on being prepared for anything! How about adding interactive elements too? Live painting sessions alongside musical performances could be incredible; I've seen artists paint to the rhythm of music before—it was mesmerizing! 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, incorporating interactive elements like live painting can create a unique experience. But we should also consider the logistics—how do we make sure these spaces are accessible and engaging for everyone?

>>Event Organizer: Right! Let's focus on ideas that work well in practice and have a real impact. Interactive workshops with local artists could be fantastic, but we've got to ensure proper space and accessibility. Maybe we can start by identifying some venues that would suit these activities.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's a great idea! Creating dedicated spaces for interactive workshops can really bring people together. We should think about how these spaces reflect cultural diversity. Perhaps we could feature specific traditions from various communities—any thoughts on which ones might resonate most?

>>Event Organizer: Absolutely! We need ideas that are both impactful and practical. Interactive workshops with local artists are great, but let's make sure we have the right spaces and resources to support them. How about reaching out to some community leaders for their input on potential themes?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's fascinating how festivals can bridge different cultural traditions. Prioritizing zones that highlight diverse traditions could allow attendees to experience a rich tapestry of narratives. Maybe storytelling sessions led by community elders could be part of this.

>>Music Festival Curator: Picture this—a festival stage where emerging artists showcase their talents by blending traditional and modern music genres, maybe even featuring cross-cultural collaborations. It'd keep the festival exciting while supporting local talent!

>>Event Organizer: Alright folks, let's dive into the logistics of these zones. We need them to be accessible and engaging for everyone. How about starting by mapping out potential locations? And Cultural Anthropologist, any specific cultural traditions you think should be highlighted?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: In my experience, storytelling sessions led by community elders can enrich the festival experience significantly—they offer a unique opportunity for attendees to connect with cultural narratives deeply.

>>Event Organizer: Okay, let's get moving on this! Mapping out potential locations for these cultural zones is key—and ensuring we have the resources to support them is crucial.

>>Music Festival Curator: What if we incorporated musical fusion workshops where attendees learn about blending traditional and modern genres? It'd engage people while showcasing local talent in an interactive way! 
 >>Event Organizer: Alright, let's wrap this up. We'll map out potential locations for these activities and ensure resources are available to support them. Let's make it happen!

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! And we should choose places that have cultural significance—it'll make everything more meaningful.

>>Music Festival Curator: Great point! Imagine a musical fusion workshop at one of those spots—it'd be incredible! Local musicians could jam together using both traditional and modern instruments.

>>Event Organizer: Right, we'll assign teams to handle logistics like transportation and power supply. Plus, we'll work with local artisans to create interactive spaces that really draw people in.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, festivals can serve as a bridge between generations and cultures. Involving community elders in storytelling sessions would add so much depth to the events.

>>Music Festival Curator: And what if we mix live music sessions with local artists and emerging talents? It would give attendees a chance to experience something truly unique—an unforgettable atmosphere.

>>Event Organizer: Okay, here's the plan again but with some tweaks based on your ideas: we'll set up specific teams for logistics like transportation and power supply, coordinate with local artisans for interactive spaces, and involve community elders in storytelling. Fantastic! The show must go on!"
