Bilingual Education,"

In bilingual education, students are taught in two (or more) languages.[1] It is distinct from learning a second language as a subject because both languages are used for instruction in different content areas like math, science, and history. The time spent in each language depends on the model. For example, some models focus on providing education in both languages throughout a student's entire education while others gradually transition to education in only one language.[2] The ultimate goal of bilingual education is fluency and literacy in both languages through a variety of strategies such as translanguaging and recasting.[3]

There are several different ways to categorize bilingual education models, one of the most common approaches being to separate programs by their end goal. This is the approach used below, though it is not the only possible approach.[4] For a more comprehensive review of different approaches to bilingual education worldwide see bilingual education by country or region and intercultural bilingual education.

In a maintenance bilingual education program, the goal is for students to continue to learn about and in both languages for the majority of their education.[5] Students in a maintenance bilingual education program should graduate being able to have a discussion about any content area in either language.[6] Two common forms of maintenance bilingual education are two-way/dual language immersion and developmental (late-exit) bilingual education. Both programs are considered language immersion programs.

A program that utilizes two languages, known as a dual language program, typically places students in classrooms with a mixture of native speakers for each language. One popular approach to dual language programs is the 90/10 model, where in the early grades 90% of instruction is conducted in the student's native language and 10% is taught in their second language. As the student advances, this proportion changes until an equal amount of time is spent on both languages. Another model, the 50/50 model, starts with an even distribution of instruction time between the two languages right from the start of the student's education.[7]

In a late exit or developmental program, students all have the same native language. They tend to follow the 90/10 model described above and gradually transition from a majority of instruction in their home language to a more balanced split between languages as they progress through primary school.[8]

In a bimodal bilingual program, students are taught in two languages in two different modalities, typically a spoken/written language and a signed language. This type of program is common at schools serving deaf and hard of hearing students.[9]

In transitional (early-exit) bilingual education programs, the goal is to provide education in a child's native language to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas such as mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning the new language.[10] Unlike in maintenance bilingual education programs, when the child's second language proficiency is deemed satisfactory, they transition to using only that language.[4] This approach is based on the common underlying proficiency model of bilingualism which posits that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later.[11] While the linguistic goal of such programs is to help students transition to mainstream, single language classrooms, the use of the student's primary language as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge also prevents the degeneration of a child's native language.[12] Transitional bilingual education is the most prominent special language program in the United States with around 60% of state and locally funded programs having this title. However, according to a study of educational effectiveness by educational social scientists, transitional bilingual education programs have the same or worse effect on English Language Learner students than other types of bilingual education that are prominent in Canada. [13]

English as a second language (ESL) programs are not considered bilingual education programs because they do not aim to have students become bi-literate in two (or more) languages. The goal of ESL programs is for English-language learners to learn English after having acquired one or more native languages. ESL is a supplementary, comprehensive English language learning program common in English-speaking countries and countries where English has an important role in communication as a result of colonialism or globalization.[14] One common approach in ESL programs is sheltered English instruction (SEI). Bilingual education ESL programs are increasingly common throughout the United States, especially in states with large immigrant populations. California, for example, had 2,363,000 Dual Language Learners in 2022, making up 32% of all children aged 0-8. [15]

Translanguaging or language mixing is a strategy that emphasizes using all languages a student knows to support their learning. One example of this is allowing students to express themselves in either or both languages when discussing different academic content.[16] Practicing translanguaging can help students more easily switch between languages.[17]

Language separation in a classroom refers to assigning a specific language for a particular time, content, or activity with the aim of helping students concentrate on developing their skills in that language. Bilingual programs often combine both language separation and translanguaging approaches to facilitate students in achieving bi-literacy.[18]

Instructional scaffolding can be used in all types of education, not only bilingual education. A teacher scaffolds instruction to provide the necessary support for students to learn the content. In a bilingual education classroom, this could look like pre-teaching content in the student's native language before teaching the same content in the second language.[citation needed]

In bilingual education, teachers may use different techniques to correct students' language errors. One such technique is recasting, which involves repeating the student's statement with corrections for any grammatical or pronunciation mistakes, akin to how parents assist their children in learning their first language. Another technique is explicit correction, where the teacher directly points out the error in the student's statement.[19]

This section focuses on the effects of bilingual education specifically, see Cognitive effects of bilingualism for information about the effects of bilingualism or multilingualism.

The most obvious benefit of bilingual education is proficiency and literacy in two (or more languages).[20] Fluency in multiple languages can lead to increased employment options[21] as well as create more opportunities for intercultural communication.[22][23]

Bilingual education can also support minority language speakers by communicating the value of their home or heritage language, resulting in increased self-esteem.[24][25] Additionally, bilingual education models have been shown to improve student engagement and attendance as parent involvement in school activities.[26][27]

Bilingual education supports students in becoming literate in both languages, which has been shown to increase reading scores for students in both languages.[27][28] Researchers have proposed that this could be due to students in bilingual programs having an increased awareness of languages and their writing systems.[23]

While there has been significant research on the ""bilingual brain,"" research specifically on how bilingual education impacts brain structure and activation is fairly limited. Though much of the research on bilinguals shows that the benefits of bilingualism are maximized when children are exposed to multiple languages at an early age,[29] as they are in many bilingual education programs.[30] However, some initial research has shown preschool children in bilingual education programs have similar brain activation patterns in response to known and unknown languages as adults who have been learning a second language for several years.[31]

In many English-speaking countries, standardized tests are in English, so there is a push to maximize the time spent learning English. Proponents of this framing advocate for Structured English Immersion in which students spend the majority of their day learning about English and in English with scaffolded supports based on their current English knowledge.[32]

Bilingual education requires teachers to be fluent and literate in both languages, as compared to English as a second language programs that only require teachers to have English fluency and literacy.[33][34]

Bilingual education can also support language revitalization efforts in countries with endangered languages.[35] These dormant languages are heavily intertwined with the culture, place and identity of the subsequent community, so the creation of bilingual programs to help re-awaken the endangered languages is extremely beneficial. Generally speaking, the official primary and secondary languages of a country are favored for bilingual programs, but there have been emerging bilingual programs to re-introduce an endangered language to a community.[36] These education policies are fundamental to a communities' and next generation's identity development. An example that hindered this is that of the residential schools of Canada. Children were punished severely for speaking their mother-tongue, which has caused generational trauma among a plethora of Indigenous persons who attended these schools throughout the country.[36] However, learning from events such as these, has helped spread awareness of language revitalization.

Bilingual programs for language revitalization are tricky; each language is different, and there is a lack of educational resources and training for teachers in that specific language. Furthermore, there is not enough research done on what the goal for bilingual programs is: is it cultural acknowledgment or bilingualism?[37] Quite often there is a clash between the government educational policies and the actual implementation of said policies.[37] That being said, there has been tremendous progress of working bilingual programs, one being in New Zealand. The Māori community in the Te Kōhanga Reo region created an early language childhood program that includes traditional customs of the culture.[38] The program takes advantage of having native speakers while also recognizing that new and upcoming speakers can help the language adapt to more modern times.[38]

Thanks to the emerging language revitalization programs, more communities can break free from an accommodation norm – feeling threatened to speak their native language due to political tensions, such as colonialism that still persists throughout most nations.[39] The question of whose language and knowledge is more valuable should no longer linger with the help of these bilingual programs.[36]

It's great to see familiar faces here today. Let's start by outlining our objectives for this meeting: discussing the current state of bilingual education and exploring effective policy implementation strategies.
>>Linguist: Morning! I'm excited about today's discussion on bilingual education strategies.
>>Community Advocate: Hi all! Looking forward to diving into how we can improve policy implementation for bilingual education.
>>Educational Policy Maker: Absolutely! We need to align our strategies with the needs of both students and educators for better educational equity.
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: That's right. Let's explore practical classroom applications so every student benefits from bilingual education.
>>Psychologist: As we discuss these strategies, let's also consider their impact on cognitive and emotional development alongside academic achievement. How can we support their mental well-being while fostering language proficiency?
>>Sociologist: Good point. From my perspective, it's crucial we look at how these policies affect community dynamics and social equity too. 
 >>Linguist: Bilingual education models like dual language immersion help students become fluent in both languages while also enhancing their cognitive skills and cultural understanding. It's really about creating an environment where both languages can thrive.
>>Educational Policy Maker: Right, but we need to focus on how these models can be effectively implemented across different schools. Policies should be tailored to meet the specific needs of each community. Using data-driven decisions will help us make these programs as impactful as possible.
>>Community Advocate: You know, cultural preservation is crucial in these programs. Imagine if we could create programs that not only teach languages but also deeply integrate cultural practices and traditions. This way, students don't just learn to speak another language; they connect with their heritage and identity.
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: Absolutely! Integrating cultural practices can really enrich students' learning experiences. For instance, in a dual language immersion program, we can use translanguaging strategies to help students switch seamlessly between languages. It boosts their confidence and reinforces their understanding of content across subjects.
>>Psychologist: That's interesting! I've seen how it helps with mental flexibility too. Students in maintenance programs often develop strong mental resilience, which enhances their overall academic performance. How can we support their emotional well-being to ensure they thrive?
>>Linguist: Integrating cultural practices is like adding different ingredients to a recipe—it makes the final dish richer.
>>Community Advocate (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! I love that comparison about the recipe—it's so vivid! But I'm curious about how exactly you see this playing out practically? Like what kind of activities would nurture this 'recipe'?
>>Linguist: Great question! Practical activities could include traditional storytelling sessions where students share tales from their cultures or organizing cultural festivals within schools where different traditions are celebrated through music, dance, and food.
>>Educational Policy Maker: We need policies that support activities like bilingual storytelling sessions or cultural festivals to ensure both languages are valued equally. Tailoring these programs based on community needs will optimize educational equity. 
 >>Linguist: You know, transitional bilingual education programs aim to ensure students don't fall behind in core subjects while acquiring a new language. The challenge is balancing the transition without compromising proficiency in either language.

>>Community Advocate: Absolutely, and these programs can really help preserve our cultural heritage while promoting academic success. Imagine if we could integrate more community-driven activities that celebrate our roots during this transition. How can we create spaces where students feel connected to their culture even as they master a new language?

>>Bilingual Education Teacher: That's a great point! In the classroom, one effective strategy is using scaffolding techniques—pre-teaching content in the student's native language before transitioning to the second language. This helps them grasp core concepts without falling behind academically. What do you think about incorporating local stories or traditions into this approach?

>>Educational Policy Maker: Actually, policy implementation is key here. We need data-driven decisions that support both linguistic and cognitive development during this transition. By setting clear standards and integrating community-specific activities, we can enhance educational equity and make the transition smoother for students.

>>Psychologist: Um, let's consider the cognitive and emotional impact of transitional bilingual education on students. How can we support mental well-being during the transition? Every student is unique, and emotional resilience matters in ensuring they don't feel overwhelmed or disconnected.

>>Sociologist: From a sociological perspective, these programs often serve as a bridge, fostering social cohesion by maintaining cultural identity while promoting linguistic proficiency. However, there's a challenge in ensuring equity across diverse communities. How do we address potential disparities so all students benefit equally from these programs?

>>Community Advocate: You know what? It's crucial that we focus not just on language skills but also on keeping our traditions alive. What if we could incorporate local customs into the curriculum? This way, students learn a new language while staying connected to their heritage.

>>Bilingual Education Teacher: Consider this—integrating translanguaging strategies effectively by allowing students to express themselves in both languages during discussions builds confidence and proficiency simultaneously. How do we ensure these practices are consistently applied across different subjects?

>>Psychologist: Indeed! Mental well-being is crucial; every student adapts differently to changes like these transitions. Let's think about incorporating mindfulness practices or peer support groups to help them build emotional resilience.

>>Educational Policy Maker: Speaking of resources, how do we tackle funding challenges for these programs? Maybe exploring partnerships with local businesses or grants could be beneficial.

>>Linguist: That's an interesting angle! Long-term impacts are also worth considering—how does bilingual education affect career opportunities down the line? I've seen studies suggesting positive outcomes; perhaps that's something we should delve into further. 
 >>Bilingual Education Teacher: Let's talk about how we can use translanguaging in the classroom. For example, letting students switch between languages during group discussions can help them understand better and feel more comfortable. How can we make sure this works for everyone?
>>Educational Policy Maker: Translanguaging is a great tool if used right. We need to think about how our policies can support teachers in using it consistently. By setting clear guidelines and providing resources, we can make sure all students benefit.
>>Linguist: Absolutely! Translanguaging helps with language learning because it mirrors how our brains naturally handle multiple languages. When students switch between languages, they engage more deeply and become more flexible with their language skills.
>>Community Advocate: It's not just about switching languages; it's also about embracing cultural identity. Imagine bringing local traditions and stories into these discussions—it would make them more relatable and engaging for students.
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone pauses briefly)
>>Psychologist (annoyed): Ugh, that phone!
>>(Phone stops ringing)
>>Community Advocate: Sorry about that! As I was saying, integrating local traditions and stories into translanguaging practices could really help.
>>Linguist: And recasting is another useful technique. It's when you repeat what someone said but correctly—like if they say ""I goed,"" you respond with ""Oh, you went."" It's a gentle way to correct mistakes without discouraging them.
>>Educational Policy Maker: Right, so we need policies that support these techniques in classrooms. Clear guidelines and resources will help teachers use translanguaging effectively.
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: I've seen this work well in my class when students share stories from their cultures. It makes the lessons more engaging and helps everyone learn better. 
 >>Linguist: The shortage of fluent teachers is a significant barrier to effective bilingual education. Without proficient educators, students may struggle to achieve true fluency and literacy in both languages. Moreover, resources for endangered languages are often scarce, making it challenging to implement comprehensive programs that support language revitalization.
>>Community Advocate: The shortage of fluent teachers is definitely a challenge, but what if we could get our community's native speakers involved? Language is part of who we are, and having community members help out can really preserve our culture while solving resource issues. Together we can make a difference.
>>Educational Policy Maker: Creating targeted training programs for native-speaking community members ensures they meet educational standards while preserving cultural integrity. Data-driven decisions will help us allocate resources effectively and promote educational equity.
>>Psychologist: Building on what was said about mentorship programs, let's also consider how the shortage of fluent teachers affects students emotionally and cognitively. Without fluent teachers, students may experience frustration and anxiety, which can hinder their language acquisition and overall mental well-being. How can we support these students to build emotional resilience while navigating these challenges?
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: One effective strategy is mentorship programs where experienced bilingual educators guide new teachers. This not only helps in skill development but also fosters a supportive community. How can we improve these mentorship initiatives?
>>Sociologist: From a sociological perspective, the social impact of bilingual education is profound. When communities engage in language revitalization efforts, it not only preserves cultural heritage but also strengthens social cohesion and identity. While involving community members is crucial, we must also address systemic barriers like resource allocation that were mentioned earlier.
>>Community Advocate: Imagine if we could create community-driven programs that not only teach the language but also immerse students in cultural practices. This way we're not just preserving the language but also the rich heritage that comes with it. What if we could involve elders and storytellers to bring these languages to life?
>>Linguist: Integrating cultural practices into bilingual education enriches the learning experience and serves as a vital tool for language revitalization. By embedding traditional customs and stories within the curriculum, we can create a more immersive environment that supports both linguistic proficiency and cultural identity. 
 >>Community Advocate: Let me share an example from New Zealand's Māori program. Imagine if we could create similar community-driven initiatives here, where native speakers and cultural practices are integrated into early childhood education. Language is our identity, and these programs show how powerful it can be when we work together to preserve it.
>>Educational Policy Maker: That's a great point! We need to figure out how to make this work here. Implementing policies that leverage local traditions and involve community members is crucial. But we also need to consider the challenges, like funding and training teachers.
>>Linguist: Absolutely, the Māori program is inspiring. It shows that integrating heritage language and cultural activities can really boost linguistic proficiency and cultural identity. But let's not forget the importance of adapting these ideas to fit our own community's needs.
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: I agree! In my classroom, I've seen firsthand how engaging students with traditional stories or crafts makes learning more meaningful for them. It's not just about language; it's about connecting with their roots.
>>Psychologist: And there's a significant cognitive and emotional impact too. When students engage with their heritage language, they feel a stronger sense of belonging and identity, which is crucial for their mental well-being. How do you think we can best support students in bilingual settings?
>>Linguist: That's a great question! One way might be through regular check-ins with students to understand their emotional needs better. Also, involving parents in the process can help reinforce what they're learning at school.
>>Community Advocate: Speaking of involving parents, let me share another example from Hawaii's Pūnana Leo program. They've successfully revitalized the Hawaiian language by immersing children in cultural practices from a young age. If we could replicate such change here, it would be amazing!
>>Educational Policy Maker: The success of these programs definitely highlights the importance of tailored approaches. But I'm concerned about how we'll fund these initiatives locally. We need to look at potential grants or partnerships.
>>Bilingual Education Teacher: You know what? Integrating elders into daily classroom activities really works wonders! Having them share traditional stories or teach crafts makes learning so much more engaging for students.
>>Community Advocate: Yes, but we also need to ensure that these elders feel supported and valued in their roles within the schools. 
 >>Linguist: You know, integrating elders into educational roles not only supports cultural preservation but also enhances students' intercultural communication skills. Language is a living entity, and having native speakers involved can really help students understand and appreciate linguistic diversity.

>>Educational Policy Maker: Absolutely! We need to think about how we can use data to better integrate native speakers into educational roles. This could boost employment opportunities and improve intercultural communication skills among students.

>>Community Advocate: Involving native speakers in bilingual education can be a game-changer for cultural preservation. Imagine if students could learn math or science through the lens of their heritage language—it's not just about language skills but embracing identity and history. Together we can make a difference by integrating these voices into our classrooms.

>>Sociologist: From a sociological perspective, the social impact of bilingual education is profound. When native speakers are integrated into educational roles, it strengthens community dynamics by fostering intercultural communication and equity in education. These programs can transform communities by bridging cultural gaps and promoting inclusivity.

>>Linguist: Moreover, the cognitive benefits of bilingual education cannot be overstated. Research shows that students engaged in bilingual programs exhibit enhanced mental flexibility and problem-solving skills. This prepares them for diverse employment opportunities while fostering a deeper understanding of different cultures.

>>Bilingual Education Teacher: Let's explore how bilingual education can be a catalyst for both personal and professional growth. When students learn in two languages, they're not just gaining language skills but also developing critical thinking abilities that are highly valued in the workforce. It's amazing to see how this approach opens doors to diverse career paths while fostering a deeper connection with different cultures.

>>Psychologist: Well, let's consider the emotional resilience that bilingual education fosters. When students see their heritage language valued, it boosts their self-esteem and identity, which is crucial for mental well-being. How can we support these students in maintaining this positive emotional impact throughout their educational journey?

>>Linguist: Bilingual education serves as a bridge between cultures, allowing students to navigate and appreciate diverse perspectives. This intercultural competence is invaluable in today's globalized job market where understanding across cultural boundaries is essential.

>>Educational Policy Maker: To illustrate this point further—data-driven decisions can significantly enhance the integration of native speakers into educational roles. By analyzing employment trends and community needs, we can create targeted training programs that boost employment opportunities while fostering intercultural communication skills among students.

>>Community Advocate: Imagine if we could harness the power of bilingual education to not only teach languages but also preserve our cultural heritage. When students learn through their heritage language it strengthens their identity and connects them deeply with their community—like giving them roots while they grow wings.

>>Bilingual Education Teacher: Consider this—bilingual education not only enhances students' language skills but also boosts their confidence and self-esteem. When they see their heritage language valued in the classroom it reinforces their identity motivating them to engage more deeply with studies. How can we further integrate these practices to support minority language speakers? 
 >>Community Advocate: Let me share a story from our community. We had elders come in to share traditional tales in their native language, and the students were captivated. It was amazing to see how these stories not only preserved our culture but also helped the students feel more connected.

>>Linguist: That's a great point! Integrating community elders' storytelling can significantly enhance students' cognitive and cultural development. I've seen it work wonders in other districts where they held monthly storytelling sessions with elders. How do you think we can best align resources across departments to support this initiative without stepping on each other's toes?

>>Community Advocate: I totally agree with you there. Imagine if we could bring community elders into the fold more actively—not just for storytelling but as cultural mentors across departments. This could bridge gaps and foster a shared understanding of our goals. But what if some departments are hesitant? How do we address that?

>>Educational Policy Maker: To illustrate, resolving interdepartmental conflicts requires a structured approach. We need clear communication channels and shared objectives across departments. Maybe forming cross-departmental committees could help us allocate resources efficiently while ensuring community elders' storytelling is integrated seamlessly.

>>Bilingual Education Teacher: Building on what you said, let's explore how we can practically integrate community elders' storytelling into our classrooms. Creating interactive sessions where students engage directly with these stories enhances language skills and fosters a deeper cultural connection. Perhaps starting with pilot programs could be a way forward—what do others think?

>>Psychologist: Um, let's consider the emotional resilience that students gain from engaging with community elders' storytelling. This interaction not only enhances cognitive abilities but also provides a sense of belonging and identity. But I'm concerned about consistency—how can we ensure these sessions are supported regularly?
