Table_Tennis,"Table tennis (also known as ping-pong) is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin, which can affect the ball's trajectory more than in other ball sports.
Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.
Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with event categories in both men's and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF handbook. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.


History

The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as an after-dinner parlour game. It has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British military officers in India around the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball. In 1883, British sporting goods company Slazenger filed a patent for a net for table tennis.
The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s, making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, term. The U.S. trademark for ""Ping-Pong"" is currently owned by Indian Industries, Inc. d/b/a Escalade Sports.
The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British table tennis enthusiast, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of pimpled, or stippled, rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was growing in popularity by 1901 to the extent that tournaments were being organized, books were being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902. In those early days, the scoring system was the same as in lawn tennis.
Although both a ""Table Tennis Association"" and a ""Ping Pong Association"" existed by 1910, a new Table Tennis Association was founded in 1921, and renamed the English Table Tennis Association in 1926. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed.
In the 1930s, Edgar Snow commented in Red Star Over China that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in the 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects.
In the 1950s, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, introducing greater spin and speed. These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue beginning in the mid-1980s increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988.


Rules and regulations
The official rules and regulations are specified in the ITTF handbook, which was first published in 1927. The current (fiftieth) version was published in 2022.


Rule changes

After the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the ITTF instituted several rule changes that were aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport. First, the older 38 mm (1.50 in) balls were officially replaced by 40 mm (1.57 in) balls in October 2000. This increased the ball's air resistance and effectively slowed down the game. By that time, players had begun increasing the thickness of the fast sponge layer on their paddles, which made the game excessively fast and difficult to watch on television. A few months later, the ITTF changed from a 21-point to an 11-point scoring system (and the serve rotation was reduced from five points to two), effective in September 2001. This was intended to make games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a player from hiding the ball during service, in order to increase the average length of rallies and to reduce the server's advantage, effective in 2002. For the opponent to have time to realize a serve is taking place, the ball must be tossed a minimum of 16 centimetres (6.3 in) in the air. The ITTF states that all events after July 2014 are played with a new poly material ball.


Equipment


Ball

The international rules specify that the game is played with a sphere having a mass of 2.7 grams (0.095 oz) and a diameter of 40 millimetres (1.57 in). The rules say that the ball shall bounce up 24–26 cm (9.4–10.2 in) when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm (12.0 in) onto a standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92. As of 2015, balls are now made of a polymer instead of celluloid, colored white or orange, with a matte finish. The choice of ball color is made according to the table color and its surroundings. For example, a white ball is easier to see on a green or blue table than it is on a grey table. Manufacturers often indicate the quality of the ball with a star rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade. As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official competition is upon ITTF approval (the ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball).
The 40 mm ball was introduced after the end of the 2000 Summer Olympics; previously a 38 mm ball was standard. This created some controversies. Vladimir Samsonov, the World No. 1 table tennis professional at the time, threatened to pull out of the World Cup, which was scheduled to debut the new regulation ball on 12 October 2000.


Table

The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in) when a standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 77%. The table or playing surface is uniformly dark colored and matte, divided into two halves by a net at 15.25 cm (6.0 in) in height. The ITTF approves only wooden tables or their derivates. Concrete tables with a steel net or a solid concrete partition are sometimes available in outside public spaces, such as parks.


Playing area
ITTF regulations require a playing space of at least 14 m (45.9 ft) long by 7 m (23.0 ft) wide, and a height clearance of at least 5 m (16.4 ft). For wheelchair events, the minimums are 8 m (26.2 ft) long and 6 m (19.7 ft) wide.


Racket

Players are equipped with a laminated wooden racket covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the grip of the player. The ITTF uses the term ""racket"", though ""bat"" is common in Britain, and ""paddle"" in the U.S. and Canada.
The wooden portion of the racket, often referred to as the ""blade"", commonly features anywhere between one and seven plies of wood, though cork, glass fiber, carbon fiber, aluminum fiber, and Kevlar are sometimes used. According to the ITTF regulations, at least 85% of the blade by thickness shall be of natural wood. Common wood types include balsa, limba, cypress, and hinoki, which is popular in Japan. The average size of the blade is about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) long and 15 centimetres (5.9 in) wide. Although the official restrictions only focus on the flatness and rigidity of the blade itself, these dimensions are optimal for most play styles.
Table tennis regulations allow different rubber surfaces on each side of the racket. Various types of surfaces provide various levels of spin or speed, and in some cases they nullify spin. For example, a player may have a rubber that provides much spin on one side of their racket, and one that provides no spin on the other. By flipping the racket in play, different types of returns are possible. To help a player distinguish between the rubber used by their opposing player, international rules specify that one side must be black while the other side must be a bright color clearly distinguishable from black and from the color of the ball. The player has the right to inspect their opponent's racket before a match to see the type of rubber used and what color it is. Despite high-speed play and rapid exchanges, a player can see clearly what side of the racket was used to hit the ball. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the racket cannot be exchanged for another racket at any time during a match.


Gameplay


Starting a game
According to ITTF rule 2.13.1, the first service is decided by lot, normally a coin toss. It is also common for one player (or the umpire/scorer) to hide the ball in one or the other hand, usually hidden under the table, allowing the other player to guess which hand the ball is in. The correct or incorrect guess gives the ""winner"" the option to choose to serve, receive, or to choose which side of the table to use. (A common but non-sanctioned method is for the players to play the ball back and forth three times and then play out the point. This is commonly referred to as ""serve to play"", ""rally to serve"", ""play for serve"", or ""volley for serve"". Another common method is referred to as ""Ping for serve"" or ""Pinging for serve"" where players will begin playing by hitting or bouncing the ball and playing a rally spelling out the word ping P-I-N-G with each hit then playing out the point for service).


Service and return

In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. The server first stands with the ball held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle, called the freehand, and tosses the ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high. The server strikes the ball with the racket on the ball's descent so that it first touches the server's court, and then touches directly the receiver's court without touching the net assembly. In casual games, many players do not toss the ball upward; however, this is technically illegal and can give the serving player an unfair advantage.
The ball must remain behind the endline and above the playing surface of the table at all times during the service. The server's body or clothing cannot be used to obstruct sight of the ball; the opponent and the umpire must have a clear view of the ball at all times. If the umpire is doubtful of the legality of a service they may first interrupt play and give a warning to the server. If the serve is a clear failure or is doubted again by the umpire after the warning, the receiver scores a point.
If the service is ""good"", then the receiver must make a ""good"" return by hitting the ball back before it bounces a second time on receiver's side of the table so that the ball passes the net and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly. Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until the rally is over. Returning the serve is one of the most difficult parts of the game, as the server's first move is often the least predictable and thus most advantageous shot due to the numerous spin and speed choices at the server's disposal.


Let
A let is a rally of which the result is not scored, and is called in the following circumstances:

The ball touches the net in service (service), provided the service is otherwise correct or the ball is obstructed by the player on the receiving side. Obstruction means a player touches the ball when it is above or traveling towards the playing surface, not having touched the player's court since last being struck by the player.
When the player on the receiving side is not ready and the service is delivered.
Player's failure to make a service or a return or to comply with the Laws is due to a disturbance outside the control of the player.
Play is interrupted by the umpire or assistant umpire.
A let is also called foul service, if the ball hits the server's side of the table, if the ball does not pass further than the edge, and if the ball hits the table edge and hits the net.


Scoring

A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally:

The opponent fails to make a correct service or return.
After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by the opponent.
The ball passes over the player's court or beyond their end line without touching their court, after being struck by the opponent.
The opponent obstructs the ball.
The opponent strikes the ball twice successively. The hand that is holding the racket counts as part of the racket and that making a good return off one's hand or fingers is allowed. It is not a fault if the ball accidentally hits one's hand or fingers and then subsequently hits the racket.
The opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade whose surface is not covered with rubber.
The opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net assembly.
The opponent's free hand touches the playing surface.
As a receiver under the expedite system, completing 13 returns in a rally.
The opponent that has been warned by the umpire commits a second offense in the same individual match or team match. If the third offence happens, 2 points will be given to the player. If the individual match or the team match has not ended, any unused penalty points can be transferred to the next game of that match.
A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games. In competition play, matches are typically best of five or seven games.


Alternation of services and ends
Service alternates between opponents every two points (regardless of winner of the rally) until the end of the game, unless both players score ten points or the expedite system is operated, when the sequences of serving and receiving stay the same but each player serves for only one point in turn (Deuce). The player serving first in a game receives first in the next game of the match.
After each game, players switch sides of the table. In the last possible game of a match, for example the seventh game in a best of seven match, players change ends when the first player scores five points, regardless of whose turn it is to serve. If the sequence of serving and receiving is out of turn or the ends are not changed, points scored in the wrong situation are still calculated and the game shall be resumed with the order at the score that has been reached.


Doubles game

In addition to games between individual players, pairs may also play table tennis. Singles and doubles are both played in international competition, including the Olympic Games since 1988 and the Commonwealth Games since 2002.
In doubles, all the rules of single play are applied except for the following.
Service

A line painted along the long axis of the table to create doubles courts bisects the table. This line's only purpose is to facilitate the doubles service rule, which is that service must originate from the right hand ""box"" in such a way that the first bounce of the serve bounces once in said right hand box and then must bounce at least once in the opponent side's right hand box (far left box for server), or the receiving pair score a point.
Order of play, serving and receiving

Players must hit the ball in turn. For example, if A is paired with B and X is paired with Y, then A is the server and X is the receiver. and the order of play shall be A→X→B→Y. The rally proceeds this way until one side fails to make a legal return and the other side scores.
At each change of service, the previous receiver shall become the server and the partner of the previous server shall become the receiver. For example, if the previous order of play is A→X→B→Y, the order becomes X→B→Y→A after the change of service.
In the second or the latter games of a match, the game begins in reverse order of play. For example, if the order of play is A→X→B→Y at beginning of the first game, the order begins with X→A→Y→B or Y→B→X→A in the second game depending on either X or Y being chosen as the first server of the game. That means the first receiver of the game is the player who served to the first server of the game in the preceding game. In each game of a doubles match, the pair having the right to serve first shall choose which of them will do so. The receiving pair, however, can only choose in the first game of the match.
When a pair reaches 5 points in the final game, the pairs must switch ends of the table and change the receiver to reverse the order of play. For example, when the last order of play before a pair score 5 points in the final game is A→X→B→Y, the order after change shall be A→Y→B→X if A still has the second serve. Otherwise, X is the next server and the order becomes X→A→Y→B.


Expedite system
If a game is unfinished after 10 minutes of play and fewer than 18 points have been scored, the expedite system is initiated. The umpire interrupts the game, and the game resumes with players serving for one point in turn. If the expedite system is introduced while the ball is not in play, the previous receiver shall serve first. Under the expedite system, the server must win the point before the opponent makes 13 consecutive returns or the point goes to the opponent. The system can also be initiated at any time at the request of both players or pairs. Once introduced, the expedite system remains in force until the end of the match. As it is intended as a rule to shorten the duration of a match, it is mainly deployed in defensive players' matches, which tend to have longer points.


Grips

Though table tennis players grip their rackets in various ways, their grips can be classified into two major families of styles, penhold and shakehand. The rules of table tennis do not prescribe the manner in which one must grip the racket, and numerous grips are employed.


Penhold

The penhold grip is so-named because one grips the racket similarly to the way one holds a writing instrument. The style of play among penhold players can vary greatly from player to player. The most popular style, usually referred to as the Chinese penhold style, involves curling the middle, ring, and fourth finger on the back of the blade with the three fingers always touching one another. Chinese penholders favour a round racket head, for a more over-the-table style of play. In contrast, another style, sometimes referred to as the Japanese/Korean penhold grip, involves splaying those three fingers out across the back of the racket, usually with all three fingers touching the back of the racket, rather than stacked upon one another. Sometimes a combination of the two styles occurs, wherein the middle, ring and fourth fingers are straight, but still stacked, or where all fingers may be touching the back of the racket, but are also in contact with one another. Japanese and Korean penholders will often use a square-headed racket for an away-from-the-table style of play. Traditionally these square-headed rackets feature a block of cork on top of the handle, as well as a thin layer of cork on the back of the racket, for increased grip and comfort. Penhold styles are popular among players originating from East Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Traditionally, penhold players use only one side of the racket to hit the ball during normal play, and the side which is in contact with the last three fingers is generally not used. This configuration is sometimes referred to as ""traditional penhold"" and is more commonly found in square-headed racket styles. However, the Chinese developed a technique in the 1990s in which a penholder uses both sides of the racket to hit the ball, where the player produces a backhand stroke (most often topspin) known as a reverse penhold backhand by turning the traditional side of the racket to face one's self, and striking the ball with the opposite side of the racket. This stroke has greatly improved and strengthened the penhold style both physically and psychologically, as it eliminates the strategic weakness of the traditional penhold backhand.


Shakehand

The shakehand grip is so-named because the racket is grasped as if one is performing a handshake. Though it is sometimes referred to as the ""tennis"" or ""Western"" grip, it bears no relation to the Western tennis grip, which was popularized on the West Coast of the United States in which the racket is rotated 90°, and played with the wrist turned so that on impact the knuckles face the target.  In table tennis, ""Western"" refers to Western nations, for this is the grip that players native to Europe and the Americas have almost exclusively employed.
The shakehand grip's simplicity and versatility, coupled with the acceptance among top-level Chinese trainers that the European style of play should be emulated and trained against, has established it as a common grip even in China. Many world-class European and East Asian players currently use the shakehand grip, and it is generally accepted that shakehands is easier to learn than penholder, allowing a broader range of playing styles both offensive and defensive.


Seemiller
The Seemiller grip is named after the American table tennis champion Danny Seemiller, who used it. It is achieved by placing the thumb and index finger on either side of the bottom of the racquet head and holding the handle with the rest of the fingers. Since only one side of the racquet is used to hit the ball, two contrasting rubber types can be applied to the blade, offering the advantage of ""twiddling"" the racket to fool the opponent. Seemiller paired inverted rubber with anti-spin rubber. Many players today combine inverted and long-pipped rubber. The grip is considered exceptional for blocking, especially on the backhand side, and for forehand loops of backspin balls.
The Seemiller grip's popularity reached its apex in 1985 when four (Danny Seemiller, Ricky Seemiller, Eric Boggan and Brian Masters) of the United States' five participants in the World Championships used it.


Stance
'A good ready position will enable you to move quickly into position and to stay balanced whilst playing powerful strokes.'
The stance in table tennis is also known as the 'ready position'. It is the position every player initially adopts when receiving and returns to after playing a shot in order to be prepared to make the next shot. It involves the feet being spaced wider than shoulder width and a partial crouch being adopted; the crouch is an efficient posture for moving quickly from and also preloads the muscles enabling a more dynamic movement. The upper torso is positioned slightly forward and the player is looking forwards. The racket is held at the ready with a bent arm. The position should feel balanced and provide a solid base for striking and quick lateral movement. Players may tailor their stance based upon their personal preferences, and alter it during the game based upon the specific circumstances.


Types of strokes
Table tennis strokes generally break down into offensive and defensive categories.


Offensive strokes


Hit
Also known as speed drive, a direct hit on the ball propelling it forward back to the opponent. This stroke differs from speed drives in other racket sports like tennis because the racket is primarily perpendicular to the direction of the stroke and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather than spin, creating a shot that does not arc much, but is fast enough that it can be difficult to return. A speed drive is used mostly for keeping the ball in play, applying pressure on the opponent, and potentially opening up an opportunity for a more powerful attack.


Loop
Perfected during the 1960s, the loop is essentially the reverse of the chop. The racket is parallel to the direction of the stroke (""closed"") and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. A good loop drive will arc quite a bit, and once striking the opponent's side of the table will jump forward, much like a kick serve in tennis. Most professional players nowadays, such as Ding Ning, Timo Boll and Zhang Jike, primarily use loop for offense.


Counter-hit
The counter-hit is usually a counterattack against drives, normally high loop drives. The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement ""off the bounce"" (immediately after hitting the table) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. Kenta Matsudaira is known for primarily using counter-hit for offense.


Flip
When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, the player does not have the room to wind up in a backswing. The ball may still be attacked, however, and the resulting shot is called a flip because the backswing is compressed into a quick wrist action. A flip is not a single stroke and can resemble either a loop drive or a loop in its characteristics. What identifies the stroke is that the backswing is compressed into a short wrist flick.


Smash
A player will typically execute a smash when the opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high or too close to the net. It is nearly always done with a forehand stroke. Smashing uses rapid acceleration to impart as much speed on the ball as possible so that the opponent cannot react in time. The racket is generally perpendicular to the direction of the stroke. Because the speed is the main aim of this shot, the spin on the ball is often minimal, although it can be applied as well. An offensive table tennis player will think of a rally as a build-up to a winning smash. Smash is used more often with penhold grip.


Defensive strokes


Push
The push (or ""slice"" in Asia) is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice: the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. A push can be difficult to attack because the backspin on the ball causes it to drop toward the table upon striking the opponent's racket. In order to attack a push, a player must usually loop (if the push is long) or flip (if the push is short) the ball back over the net. Often, the best option for beginners is to simply push the ball back again, resulting in pushing rallies. Against good players, it may be the worst option because the opponent will counter with a loop, putting the first player in a defensive position. Pushing can have advantages in some circumstances, such as when the opponent makes easy mistakes.


Chop
A chop is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier push, taken well back from the table. The racket face points primarily horizontally, perhaps a little bit upward, and the direction of the stroke is straight down. The object of a defensive chop is to match the topspin of the opponent's shot with backspin. A good chop will float nearly horizontally back to the table, in some cases having so much backspin that the ball actually rises. Such a chop can be extremely difficult to return due to its enormous amount of backspin. Some defensive players can also impart no-spin or sidespin variations of the chop. Some famous choppers include Joo Sae-hyuk and Wu Yang.


Block
A block is executed by simply placing the racket in front of the ball right after the ball bounces; thus, the ball rebounds back toward the opponent with nearly as much energy as it came in with. This requires precision, since the ball's spin, speed, and location all influence the correct angle of a block. It is very possible for an opponent to execute a perfect loop, drive, or smash, only to have the blocked shot come back just as fast. Due to the power involved in offensive strokes, often an opponent simply cannot recover quickly enough to return the blocked shot, especially if the block is aimed at an unexpected side of the table. Blocks almost always produce the same spin as was received, many times topspin.


Lob
The defensive lob propels the ball about five metres in height, only to land on the opponent's side of the table with great amounts of spin. The stroke itself consists of lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent's side of the table. A lob can have nearly any kind of spin. Though the opponent may smash the ball hard and fast, a good defensive lob could be more difficult to return due to the unpredictability and heavy amounts of the spin on the ball. Thus, though backed off the table by tens of feet and running to reach the ball, a good defensive player can still win the point using good lobs. The lob is used less frequently by professional players. A notable exception is Michael Maze.


Effects of spin
Adding spin onto the ball causes major changes in table tennis gameplay. Although nearly every stroke or serve creates some kind of spin, understanding the individual types of spin allows players to defend against and use different spins effectively.


Backspin
Backspin is where the bottom half of the ball is rotating away from the player, and is imparted by striking the base of the ball with a downward movement. At the professional level, backspin is usually used defensively in order to keep the ball low. Backspin is commonly employed in service because it is harder to produce an offensive return, though at the professional level most people serve sidespin with either backspin or topspin.  Due to the initial lift of the ball, there is a limit on how much speed with which one can hit the ball without missing the opponent's side of the table. However, backspin also makes it harder for the opponent to return the ball with great speed because of the required angular precision of the return. Alterations are frequently made to regulations regarding equipment in an effort to maintain a balance between defensive and offensive spin choices. It is actually possible to smash with backspin offensively, but only on high balls that are close to the net.


Topspin
The topspin stroke has a smaller influence on the first part of the ball curve. Like the backspin stroke, however, the axis of spin remains roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball thus allowing for the Magnus effect to dictate the subsequent curvature. After the apex of the curve, the ball dips downwards as it approaches the opposing side, before bouncing. On the bounce, the topspin will accelerate the ball, much in the same way that a wheel which is already spinning would accelerate upon making contact with the ground. When the opponent attempts to return the ball, the topspin causes the ball to jump upwards and the opponent is forced to compensate for the topspin by adjusting the angle of his or her racket. This is known as ""closing the racket"".
The speed limitation of the topspin stroke is minor compared to the backspin stroke. This stroke is the predominant technique used in professional competition because it gives the opponent less time to respond. In table tennis topspin is regarded as an offensive technique due to increased ball speed, lower bio-mechanical efficiency and the pressure that it puts on the opponent by reducing reaction time. (It is possible to play defensive topspin-lobs from far behind the table, but only highly skilled players use this stroke with any tactical efficiency.) Topspin is the least common type of spin to be found in service at the professional level, simply because it is much easier to attack a top-spin ball that is not moving at high speed.


Sidespin
This type of spin is predominantly employed during service, wherein the contact angle of the racket can be more easily varied. Unlike the two aforementioned techniques, sidespin causes the ball to spin on an axis which is vertical, rather than horizontal. The axis of rotation is still roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball. In this circumstance, the Magnus effect will still dictate the curvature of the ball to some degree. Another difference is that, unlike backspin and topspin, sidespin will have relatively very little effect on the bounce of the ball, much in the same way that a spinning top would not travel left or right if its axis of rotation were exactly vertical. This makes sidespin a useful weapon in service, because it is less easily recognized when bouncing, and the ball ""loses"" less spin on the bounce. Sidespin can also be employed in offensive rally strokes, often from a greater distance, as an adjunct to topspin or backspin. This stroke is sometimes referred to as a ""hook"". The hook can even be used in some extreme cases to circumvent the net when away from the table.


Corkspin
Players employ this type of spin almost exclusively when serving, but at the professional level, it is also used from time to time in the lob. Unlike any of the techniques mentioned above, corkspin (or ""drill-spin"") has the axis of spin relatively parallel to the ball's trajectory, so that the Magnus effect has little or no effect on the trajectory of a cork-spun ball: upon bouncing, the ball will dart right or left (according to the direction of the spin), severely complicating the return. In theory, this type of spin produces the most obnoxious effects, but it is less strategically practical than sidespin or backspin, because of the limitations that it imposes upon the opponent during their return. Aside from the initial direction change when bouncing, unless it goes out of reach, the opponent can counter with either topspin or backspin. A backspin stroke is similar in the fact that the corkspin stroke has a lower maximum velocity, simply due to the contact angle of the racket when producing the stroke. To impart a spin on the ball which is parallel to its trajectory, the racket must be swung more or less perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball, greatly limiting the forward momentum that the racket transfers to the ball. Corkspin is almost always mixed with another variety of spin since alone, it is not only less effective but also harder to produce.


Competitions

Competitive table tennis is popular in East Asia and Europe, and has been gaining attention in the United States. The most important international competitions are the World Table Tennis Championships, the Table Tennis World Cup, the Olympics and the ITTF World Tour. Continental competitions include the following: 

European Championships
Europe Top-16
the Asian Championships
the Asian Games
Chinese players have won 60% of the men's World Championships since 1959; in the women's competition for the Corbillon Cup, Chinese players have won all but three of the World Championships since 1971. Other strong teams come from East Asia and Europe, including Austria, Belarus, Germany, Hong Kong, Portugal, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and Taiwan.
There are professional competitions at the clubs level; the respective leagues of Austria, Belgium, China (China Table Tennis Super League), Japan (T.League), France, Germany (Bundesliga), and Russia are examples of the highest level. There are also some important international club teams competitions such as the European Champions League and its former competitor, the European Club Cup, where the top club teams from European countries compete.
Virtual reality table tennis competition took place in Olympic Esports Week on June 24, 2023 in Singapore. Eleven Table Tennis was the game played during the event. The final match was played between two players both representing France. ITTF Group CEO, Steve Dainton also participated in the event. European table tennis federation and French table tennis association are also arranging virtual reality table tennis tournaments.


Naturalized players in international competition

According to the New York Times, 31% of the table tennis players at the 2016 Summer Olympics were naturalized. The rate was twice as high as the next sport, basketball, which featured 15% of naturalized players.
Feng Tianwei, a Chinese-born player representing Singapore, has medaled in three Olympic table tennis events, more medals than native Singaporeans have won in all other sports combined (two). These successes have been somewhat controversial in Singapore. In 2014, Singapore Table Tennis Association's president Lee Bee Wah quit over this issue; her successor, Ellen Lee, later favored the application for citizenship of Zeng Jian, a China-born paddler.
The rate of naturalization accelerated after the ITTF's 2009 decision (one year after China won every possible Olympic medal in the sport) to reduce the number of entries per association in both the Olympics and the World Table Tennis Championships.
In 2019, the ITTF adopted new regulations which state that players who acquired a new nationality may not represent their new association before:

1 year after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 15 when registered and has never represented another association
3 years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 15 when registered and has already represented another association
5 years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 18 but at least 15 years of age when registered
7 years after the date of registration, if the player is under the age of 21 but at least 18 years of age when registered
9 years after the date of registration, if the player is at least 21 years old when registered


Notable players

An official hall of fame exists at the ITTF Museum. A Grand Slam is earned by a player who wins singles crowns at the Olympic Games, World Championships, and World Cup. Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden first completed the grand slam at 1992 Olympic Games. Deng Yaping of China is the first female recorded at the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1996. The following table presents an exhaustive list of all players to have completed a grand slam.

Jean-Philippe Gatien, Wang Hao and Sun Yingsha won both the World Championships and the World Cup, but lost in the gold medal matches at the Olympics. Ma Lin and Chen Meng won both the Olympic gold and the World Cup, but lost in the finals of the World Championships. Jörgen Persson and Liu Shiwen also won the titles except the Olympic Games. Persson is one of the five table tennis players to have competed at seven Olympic Games. Zhang Yining and Ma Long are the only players to have completed the grand slam twice.


Governance

Founded in 1926, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) is the worldwide governing body for table tennis, which maintains an international ranking system in addition to organizing events like the World Table Tennis Championships.  In 2007, the governance for table tennis for persons with a disability was transferred from the International Paralympic Committee to the ITTF.
On many continents, there is a governing body responsible for table tennis on that continent. For example, the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) is the governing body responsible for table tennis in Europe. There are also national bodies and other local authorities responsible for the sport, such as USA Table Tennis (USATT), which is the national governing body for table tennis in the United States.


Variants
Hardbat table tennis uses rackets with short outward ""pips"" and no sponge, resulting in decreased speeds and reduced spin. World Championship of Ping Pong uses old-fashioned wooden paddles covered with sandpaper.
Round the World (also called Round Robin or Round the Table) table tennis is an informal party-type variation in which players line up on either side of the table. When a player hits the ball he sets the paddle down, and the player behind him picks it up to receive the return. When a player sets down his paddle, he moves to the line at the opposing side of the table. Players are eliminated as they lose a point. When only 2 players remain, a player hits the ball, sets his paddle down, spins and then retrieves his paddle to make the return.

It was noted that table tennis is played on a stationary table with small rackets and a light ball, requiring quick reactions and an emphasis on spin. The sport's accessibility and ability to be played indoors make it popular worldwide for both competitive and recreational purposes. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), which was founded in 1926 and includes 226 member associations globally. The history of table tennis dates back to Victorian England, evolving from a parlour game to a competitive sport with significant innovations such as celluloid balls and rubber-covered rackets introduced in the early 1900s. Rule changes after the 2000 Olympics aimed at making the game more spectator-friendly were discussed, including larger balls and shorter scoring systems. Equipment specifications for balls, tables, rackets, and playing areas were reviewed according to ITTF regulations. Various gameplay elements like service rules, scoring methods, doubles play, grips, stances, strokes, and spin effects were highlighted. Competitive aspects include major international tournaments dominated by East Asian countries like China. Governance structures at global and continental levels ensure standardized play across regions.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and smiles\n- Light-hearted comments about the day or week\n- Mention of the meeting objectives"", ""Scene 2: Table Tennis Overview\nTLDR: Introduction to table tennis, its history, and significance.\n- Coach shares quick facts about table tennis\n- Historian provides historical context and evolution of the sport\n- Player adds personal anecdotes from competitions"", ""Scene 3: Equipment and Rules Discussion\nTLDR: Review of equipment specifications and rule changes in table tennis.\n- Coach explains equipment used (balls, rackets, tables)\n- Historian discusses rule changes post-2000 Olympics\n- Player shares experiences with different equipment types"", ""Scene 4: Gameplay Elements\nTLDR: Exploration of gameplay techniques and strategies in table tennis.\n- Coach talks about grips, stances, strokes, spin effects\n- Player describes competitive strategies and training routines\n- Open floor for spontaneous questions or comments"", ""Scene 5: Competitive Landscape\nTLDR: Discussion on major international tournaments and dominant countries.\n- Historian highlights key tournaments and historical dominance by East Asian countries\n- Player shares insights on competing internationally\n- Coach discusses training methods for high-level competition"", ""Scene 6: Personal Experiences & Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Sharing personal stories related to table tennis; brief off-topic discussions allowed.\n- Each participant shares a memorable experience related to table tennis\n- Open floor for any off-topic moments or spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 7: Wrap-Up & Future Plans\nTLDR: Concluding thoughts on table tennis; discussing future catch-ups or plans.\n- Summary of key points discussed during the meeting\n- Ideas for future meetings or activities related to team building""]",">>Professional Table Tennis Player: Hey everyone! How's your week been? I had a pretty intense training session yesterday, but I'm feeling pumped for today's meeting!
>>Table Tennis Coach: Hey there! My week's been good, thanks. Any exciting plans for the weekend?
>>Sports Historian: Speaking of interesting things, I came across an old photograph of Victorian England where table tennis was played with books as nets. It's fascinating how the sport has evolved!
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Wait, really? That's interesting! Do you have a copy of that photo?
>>Sports Historian: Yes, I do! I'll send it to you after the meeting. It reminds me of how my grandfather used to tell stories about playing with makeshift equipment.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Wow, I'd love to see that too! 
 >>Sports Historian: It's interesting how table tennis evolved from a parlor game in Victorian England to a global sport. It started among the upper class and transformed into something everyone enjoys. The introduction of celluloid balls and rubber paddles in the early 20th century really sped up the game.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: The thrill of competing at international tournaments is unmatched. I remember my first World Championship; the atmosphere was electric, and every point felt like a battle. It's not just about skill but also mental toughness. You have to stay focused!
>>Table Tennis Coach: Table tennis is all about precision and timing. Hitting the ball at just the right moment can make a huge difference in your performance. Keep your eye on the ball!
>>Sports Historian: And then there's China's rise in table tennis during the mid-20th century, which is pretty fascinating. It became a symbol of national pride and was heavily promoted by the government, leading to China's dominance in the sport.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Absolutely! Competing against Chinese players is always challenging because of their strong training programs.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Let's talk about footwork in table tennis. Being able to move quickly and efficiently around the table can significantly impact your performance. How does it feel when you nail that perfect footwork?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Footwork is crucial. I remember a match where my opponent's footwork was impeccable; it felt like he was gliding across the table.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Footwork helps you position yourself correctly for each shot. Speaking of shots, let's discuss how different grips can affect your playing style.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: The grip can really change your game. I remember switching from penhold to shakehand during a crucial match; it felt like a whole new world opened up.
>>Sports Historian: I remember watching my first international table tennis match; it was incredible to see how much faster and competitive the game had become with modern equipment. 
 >>Table Tennis Coach: Alright, let's dive into the equipment specifics! The balls we use now are 40mm in diameter, which slows down the game a bit compared to the old 38mm ones. And the rackets? They can have different types of rubber on each side for varied spin and speed. Keep your eye on the ball!
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: You know, the change to 40mm balls really altered the dynamics of the game. I remember when they first introduced them; it felt like everything slowed down, but it also gave us more control over our shots. And those rackets with different rubbers? Wow! They can make or break your strategy.
>>Sports Historian: Historically speaking, the rule changes post-2000 Olympics were quite significant. The shift from 38mm to 40mm balls was intended to slow down the game and make it more viewer-friendly. Moreover, changing to an 11-point scoring system in 2001 aimed to create faster-paced matches.
>>Table Tennis Coach: The change to the 11-point scoring system really intensified matches and made them more strategic. Players had to adapt quickly, you know?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Absolutely! Adapting is crucial. I remember my first match with poly material balls introduced in 2014—it was a real challenge adjusting to their higher bounce and unpredictable spin.
>>Sports Historian: Yeah, those poly material balls standardized ball quality across competitions and influenced playing styles globally as players adapted.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Right! Understanding their higher bounce and unpredictable spin is key. It's all about adjusting your footwork and timing.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Every point counts when you're dealing with these changes. It took a while for everyone to adjust but once you get used to it... For instance, during last year's championship, I had to completely rethink my approach mid-game because of how these new balls behaved under pressure.
>>Sports Historian: These changes have definitely made the game more exciting for viewers everywhere. 
 >>Table Tennis Coach: Alright, let's dive into grips and stances! The penhold grip is quite popular in East Asia, especially China. It allows for quick wrist movements and a strong forehand. On the other hand, the shakehand grip is more common in Europe and America, offering versatility and ease of learning. What do you think about these grips?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Both grips have their merits. The penhold grip offers incredible wrist flexibility, which is great for quick attacks and spin variations. On the other hand, the shakehand grip provides a more balanced approach, making it easier to switch between forehand and backhand shots. Personally, I find the shakehand grip gives me better control during intense rallies.
>>Sports Historian: It's fascinating how these grips reflect broader cultural trends. The penhold grip originated in China, showcasing their emphasis on rapid wrist movements and agility. Meanwhile, the shakehand grip's popularity in Europe and America highlights a preference for versatility and balance.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Speaking of grips, they also affect how we generate spin during strokes like loops or sidespins. Generating topspin with a loop is crucial for controlling the ball's trajectory during intense rallies. How does it feel when you execute this technique?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: It's all about timing and precision; executing a perfect topspin shot can really put your opponent on the defensive.
>>Table Tennis Coach: And what about sidespin? Generating sidespin can throw off your opponent's timing by creating an unpredictable curve.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: A perfect sidespin serve can really mess with your opponent's positioning. I remember during my last tournament, using a sidespin serve really threw off my opponent's timing.
>>Sports Historian: Rubber paddles introduced in the 1950s changed table tennis by allowing players to generate more spin—this fundamentally altered gameplay strategies.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Footwork is crucial in table tennis! Quick footwork helps maintain balance during rallies so you can cover all angles effectively. How do you train for this?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: I focus on agility drills and practice moving quickly between shots to stay balanced. Quick footwork is absolutely crucial during matches; it allows maintaining balance especially with fast-paced rallies. 
 >>Sports Historian: Interestingly, the dominance of East Asian countries in table tennis can be traced back to historical and cultural factors. Historically speaking, China has invested heavily in developing the sport as a symbol of national pride, leading to their unparalleled success in international tournaments.
>>Table Tennis Coach: So when it comes to training for high-level competition, it's crucial to focus on both physical and mental aspects. We need to incorporate drills that enhance precision, timing, and footwork. You know, practice makes perfect! What do you think about integrating more agility exercises into our routine?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Competing internationally is a whole different ball game. The level of competition is intense, and every point counts! The mental aspect is just as crucial as physical training. I mean, you can have all the skills in the world—
>>Sports Historian (interrupting): Can I ask—what mental techniques work best against top players from China or Japan?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Great question! Visualization techniques are really effective. Imagining yourself winning points against tough opponents can boost confidence and focus.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Fantastic! Integrating agility exercises is a great idea. It will definitely help with quick footwork and maintaining balance during those intense rallies. How does that feel for everyone?
>>(All nodding) 
 >>Professional Table Tennis Player: You know, one of my most memorable experiences was competing in the World Championships. The atmosphere was electric, and every point felt like a battle. It was amazing to feel the intensity and pressure at that level. Another unforgettable moment for me was playing against a top-ranked player in an international tournament. The match was intense, with each point feeling like a battle, just like at the World Championships.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Wow, those sound like incredible experiences! One of my most memorable moments was coaching a young player who had incredible potential but struggled with consistency. We worked on his footwork and timing, and it was fantastic to see him improve and eventually win his first major tournament!
>>Sports Historian: That's fascinating! I remember discovering an old photograph from the early 1900s that depicted British officers playing a makeshift version of table tennis with books as nets and golf balls as the ball. It's interesting how those makeshift games show the creativity people had even back then. It really makes you think about how table tennis has evolved over time.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Wow, that's fascinating! I can't imagine playing with books as nets.
>>Table Tennis Coach: That sounds incredible! How did you come across that photograph?
>>Sports Historian: I found it while researching early sports history archives. It's these little discoveries that make my work so exciting.
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Speaking of exciting moments, one time during training camp we had this hilarious off-topic moment where everyone tried playing with their non-dominant hand just for fun. It really lightened up the mood!
>>Table Tennis Coach: Haha! That sounds like fun! Speaking of off-topic moments, I remember once we had an impromptu karaoke session after practice—it really brought everyone together after practice.
>>Sports Historian: That's interesting! It's these spontaneous moments that often create lasting memories and strengthen team bonds. 
 >>Table Tennis Coach: Alright, we've had some great discussions today! How about we plan a team-building activity next week with a friendly match and some new drills?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Sounds awesome! Mixing in new drills will keep it challenging. But let's make sure everyone is ready to give it their all. Every point counts, you know?
>>Sports Historian: A friendly match is a great idea for team-building, and new drills will definitely keep things interesting.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Fantastic! We can incorporate some agility exercises to keep everyone engaged and improve their skills. I'll draft an outline for the session. Can everyone review it by Friday?
>>Professional Table Tennis Player: Sure thing. And maybe we could set up a mini-tournament to keep that competitive spirit alive? What do you think?
>>Sports Historian: I agree with the idea of adding new drills; it aligns well with modern training techniques.
>>Table Tennis Coach: Great, so we've got the friendly match, new drills, and possibly a mini-tournament planned. Let's make sure it's not just about winning but also improving our skills and strategies."
