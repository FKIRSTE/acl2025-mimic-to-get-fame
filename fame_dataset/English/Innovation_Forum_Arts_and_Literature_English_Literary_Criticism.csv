Literary Criticism,"A genre of arts criticism, literary criticism or literary studies is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical analysis of literature's goals and methods. Although the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists.
Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from literary theory is a matter of some controversy. For example, The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of literary theory, because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works, while theory may be more general or abstract.
Literary criticism is often published in essay or book form. Academic literary critics teach in literature departments and publish in academic journals, and more popular critics publish their reviews in broadly circulating periodicals such as The Times Literary Supplement, The New York Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, the London Review of Books, the Dublin Review of Books, The Nation, Bookforum, and The New Yorker.


History


Classical and medieval criticism
Literary criticism is thought to have existed as far back as the classical period. In the 4th century BC Aristotle wrote the Poetics, a typology and explanation along with understanding of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. Poetics developed for the first time the concepts of mimesis and catharsis, which are still crucial in literary studies.
Later classical and medieval criticism often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of hermeneutics and textual exegesis have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of the three Abrahamic religions: Jewish literature, Christian literature and Islamic literature.
Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval Arabic literature and Arabic poetry from the 9th century, notably by Al-Jahiz in his al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin and al-Hayawan, and by Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz in his Kitab al-Badi.


Renaissance criticism
The literary criticism of the Renaissance developed classical ideas of unity of form and content into literary neoclassicism, proclaiming literature as central to culture, entrusting the poet and the author with preservation of a long literary tradition. The birth of Renaissance criticism was in 1498, with the recovery of classic texts, most notably, Giorgio Valla's Latin translation of Aristotle's Poetics. The work of Aristotle, especially Poetics, was the most important influence upon literary criticism until the late eighteenth century. Lodovico Castelvetro was one of the most influential Renaissance critics who wrote commentaries on Aristotle's Poetics in 1570.


Baroque criticism
The seventeenth-century  witnessed the first full-fledged crisis in modernity of the core critical-aesthetic principles inherited from classical antiquity, such as proportion, harmony, unity, decorum, that had long governed, guaranteed, and stabilized Western thinking about artworks. Although Classicism was very far from spent as a cultural force, it was to be gradually challenged by a rival movement, namely Baroque, that favoured the transgressive and the extreme, without laying claim to the unity, harmony, or decorum that supposedly distinguished both nature and its greatest imitator, namely ancient art. The key concepts of the Baroque aesthetic, such as ""conceit' (concetto), ""wit"" (acutezza, ingegno), and ""wonder"" (meraviglia), were not fully developed in literary theory until the publication of Emanuele Tesauro's Il Cannocchiale aristotelico (The Aristotelian Telescope) in 1654. This seminal treatise – inspired by Giambattista Marino's epic Adone and the work of the Spanish Jesuit philosopher Baltasar Gracián – developed a theory of metaphor as a universal language of images and as a supreme intellectual act, at once an artifice and an epistemologically privileged mode of access to truth.


Enlightenment criticism

In the Enlightenment period (1700s–1800s), literary criticism became more popular. During this time literacy rates started to rise in the public; no longer was reading exclusive for the wealthy or scholarly. With the rise of the literate public, the swiftness of printing and commercialization of literature, criticism arose too. Reading was no longer viewed solely as educational or as a sacred source of religion; it was a form of entertainment. Literary criticism was influenced by the values and stylistic writing, including clear, bold, precise writing and the more controversial criteria of the author's religious beliefs. These critical reviews were published in many magazines, newspapers, and journals. The commercialization of literature and its mass production had its downside. The emergent literary market, which was expected to educate the public and keep them away from superstition and prejudice, increasingly diverged from the idealistic control of the Enlightenment theoreticians so that the business of Enlightenment became a business with the Enlightenment. This development – particularly of emergence of entertainment literature – was addressed through an intensification of criticism. Many works of Jonathan Swift, for instance, were criticized including his book Gulliver's Travels, which one critic described as ""the detestable story of the Yahoos"".


19th-century Romantic criticism
The British Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new aesthetic ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could enlighten and add to the knowledge of a common subject to the level of the sublime. German Romanticism, which followed closely after the late development of German classicism, emphasized an understanding and beauty of fragmentation that can appear startlingly modern to the reader of English literature, and valued Witz – that is, ""wit"" or ""humor"" of a certain sort – more highly than the serious Anglophone Romanticism. The late nineteenth century brought renown to authors known more for their literary criticism than for their own literary work, such as Matthew Arnold.


The New Criticism
However important all of these aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken in the early twentieth century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as Russian Formalism, and slightly later the New Criticism in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the close reading of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either authorial intention (to say nothing of the author's psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or reader response: together known as Wimsatt and Beardsley's intentional fallacy and affective fallacy. This emphasis on form and precise attention to ""the words themselves"" has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.


Theory
In 1957 Northrop Frye published the influential Anatomy of Criticism. In his works Frye noted that some critics tend to embrace an ideology, and to judge literary pieces on the basis of their adherence to such ideology. This has been a highly influential viewpoint among modern conservative thinkers. E. Michael Jones, for example, argues in his Degenerate Moderns that Stanley Fish was influenced by his own adulterous affairs to reject classic literature that condemned adultery. Jürgen Habermas, in Erkenntnis und Interesse [1968] (Knowledge and Human Interests), described literary critical theory in literary studies as a form of hermeneutics: knowledge via interpretation to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressions – including the interpretation of texts which themselves interpret other texts.

In the British and American literary establishment, the New Criticism was more or less dominant until the late 1960s. Around that time Anglo-American university literature departments began to witness a rise of a more explicitly philosophical literary theory, influenced by structuralism, then post-structuralism, and other kinds of Continental philosophy. It continued until the 1990s when interest in ""concept"" peaked. Many later critics, though undoubtedly still influenced by theoretical work, have been comfortable simply interpreting literature rather than writing explicitly about methodology and philosophical presumptions.


Current state
Today, approaches based in literary theory and continental philosophy largely coexist in university literature departments, while conventional methods, some informed by the New Critics, also remain active. Disagreements over the goals and methods of literary criticism, which characterized both sides taken by critics during the ""rise"" of theory, have declined.
Some critics work largely with theoretical texts, while others read traditional literature; interest in the literary canon is still great, but many critics are also interested in nontraditional texts and women's literature, as elaborated on by certain academic journals such as Contemporary Women's Writing, while some critics influenced by cultural studies read popular texts like comic books or pulp/genre fiction. Ecocritics have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. Darwinian literary studies studies literature in the context of evolutionary influences on human nature. And postcritique has sought to develop new ways of reading and responding to literary texts that go beyond the interpretive methods of critique. Many literary critics also work in film criticism or media studies.


History of the book
Related to other forms of literary criticism, the history of the book is a field of an inter-disciplinary inquiry drawing on the methods of bibliography, cultural history, history of literature, and media theory. Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.
Among the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.

Great to see you all here. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of literary criticism and its evolution over time. Feel free to jump in with your thoughts or questions as we go along.
>>Literary Critic: The evolution of literary criticism has seen some major changes over time. Take the shift from classical to Renaissance criticism—there was a big focus on unity of form and content back then. Later, Baroque aesthetics came in, favoring more extreme and transgressive styles. What does this imply for our understanding of literary traditions?
>>Historian: Absolutely! And that shift mirrored broader cultural changes. The Renaissance was all about moving away from medieval fragmentation towards a more unified approach. How did these changes influence subsequent literary movements?
>>Philosopher: Interesting point! From a philosophical angle, these shifts reflect deeper changes in how we understand knowledge itself. How can we see this in relation to Continental philosophy's impact on literary theory?
>>Literary Critic: You know, the interplay between literary theory and criticism is indeed fascinating. These methodological changes show not just shifts in thinking but also how dynamic literature is as an art form. How should we interpret these changes in light of contemporary practices?
>>Philosopher: Well, particularly through the lens of Continental philosophy, it reveals profound shifts in how we perceive subjective experience and individual freedom. How do phenomenology and existentialism play into this?
>>Historian: To understand the evolution of literary criticism, we must consider how Enlightenment values influenced its development too. The rise in literacy rates and commercialization during that period led to a more diverse readership, democratizing literature consumption.
>>Educator: Right! And it's interesting how those changes made literature more accessible to everyone—it wasn't just for scholars anymore; it became something people could enjoy casually.
>>Literary Critic: Indeed! The Enlightenment period's impact cannot be overstated—the rise in literacy rates fundamentally altered the landscape, making works accessible to many and intensifying critical engagement.
>>Philosopher: Exactly! From a philosophical standpoint, this period marked the transition from literature as an elite pursuit to a more accessible form of cultural expression.
>>Historian: Well said! And that accessibility changed everything—literature became part of everyday life for many people. 
 >>Literary Critic: The Enlightenment made literature accessible to more people, which meant critics had to look at works in new ways.
>>Philosopher: That's true! And it also led us to explore texts through new philosophical lenses, like focusing on personal experiences and deeper meanings.
>>Historian: Exactly! Higher literacy rates during the Enlightenment turned literature into something people enjoyed as well as learned from. It became a form of cultural commentary.
>>Educator: And these historical shifts really enrich our teaching methods today because we can relate them to students' lives and experiences.
>>Literary Critic: Right, so when we teach literature now, we're not just looking at the text itself but also considering its broader impact and how it reflects human nature.
>>Philosopher: Absolutely. Philosophical movements have changed our approach by emphasizing subjective experience. This makes literary analysis much more engaging and relevant.
>>Historian: It's fascinating how the rise in literacy transformed literature's role in society. It went from being purely educational or religious to something that could entertain and provoke thought.
>>Educator: Yes, and that transformation is still evident today. When students see how literature has evolved, they can appreciate its relevance in their own lives. 
 >>Historian: Um, to understand the evolution of literary studies, we must consider how historical contexts have shaped critical approaches. For instance, the Enlightenment period's emphasis on accessibility and democratization profoundly influenced literary criticism, making it more inclusive and reflective of societal changes.

>>Literary Critic: Absolutely! The Enlightenment's push for accessibility opened doors for diverse voices. But what about the rise of nontraditional texts and women's literature? How do these developments fit into this broader narrative?

>>Educator: That's a great point. The inclusion of nontraditional texts and women's literature really shakes up traditional narratives. It's refreshing to see new perspectives being recognized in literary studies. Have you noticed any specific works that stand out?

>>Philosopher: Definitely! Take Mary Wollstonecraft's ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,"" for example. It not only challenged societal norms but also paved the way for feminist literary criticism. This shift forces us to rethink what we value in literature.

>>Literary Critic: Yes, Wollstonecraft is a perfect example. And then there's Zora Neale Hurston's ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" which brought African American women's experiences to the forefront. These works redefine our understanding of merit and cultural significance.

>>Philosopher: Exactly! And from a philosophical standpoint, these texts invite us to explore deeper implications of inclusivity in literature. How can we use these insights to shape future directions in literary studies?

>>Historian: Historically speaking, um, this shift towards inclusivity reflects broader societal changes initiated during the Enlightenment but carried forward by subsequent movements like feminism and civil rights. It's fascinating how these developments influence each other over time.

>>Educator: Right! And incorporating these diverse voices into curricula helps students see themselves reflected in what they study, making learning more engaging. What strategies do you think educators can use to integrate these texts effectively?

>>Literary Critic: One approach could be thematic units that highlight different perspectives within a historical context—like pairing Wollstonecraft with contemporary feminist writers or Hurston with modern African American authors.

>>Philosopher: Absolutely! And considering phenomenological aspects allows us to delve into lived experiences represented by these works. Educators could use philosophical insights to encourage students to connect personally with the material.

>>Historian: Well said! Understanding historical contexts behind these shifts is crucial for educators aiming to provide comprehensive views on literature's evolution. 
 >>Educator: You know, one of the most amazing things I've seen is when students take a concept and run with it in unexpected directions. I remember this one time, um, a student used a historical event to create an innovative project that blew everyone away!

>>Literary Critic: Absolutely! Encouraging creativity in literature requires an environment where students can engage deeply with texts, exploring their own perceptions and experiences. This reminds me of a time when I had my students interpret a classic novel through the lens of contemporary social issues. The results were fascinating!

>>Philosopher: Well, promoting new ideas means creating a space where individuals can think beyond everyday concepts and explore deeper meanings. For instance, when students analyze their personal experiences, they often uncover profound insights that spark original thinking.

>>Historian: In historical context, encouraging creativity in literary criticism has often been tied to broader cultural shifts. For instance, during the Enlightenment—

>>Literary Critic: Wait, can you explain how these changes affected literary criticism?

>>Historian: Of course! During the Enlightenment, um, the rise of literacy and the democratization of literature allowed for more diverse voices and perspectives to emerge. This period saw critics engaging with texts not just as educational tools but as sources of entertainment and social commentary.

>>Literary Critic: In the grand scheme of things, promoting originality in literary criticism requires balancing deep textual engagement with personal interpretation. I recall an instance where students reimagined Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' using modern psychological theories. The results were not only creative but also profoundly insightful.

>>Philosopher: Indeed! When students dive into their own experiences and challenge conventional perspectives, they often come up with innovative ideas that surprise us all.

>>Literary Critic: Exactly! Encouraging students to reinterpret texts through various critical lenses can lead to groundbreaking insights. I remember when my class analyzed a classic novel using feminist theory—it sparked some incredible discussions. 
 >>Educator: You know, when students get the chance to explore literature through different perspectives, it really opens up their minds. I remember a student project where they reimagined Shakespeare's plays in modern settings—it was so innovative and engaging!
>>Philosopher: Absolutely! It's amazing how reimagining Shakespeare can bring new insights. How do you think this impacts their overall learning experience?
>>Literary Critic: Yes, it's great to see these classics come alive in modern settings. It not only revitalizes them but also invites us to examine their themes in today's context.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, reinterpretations like these have always enriched literary discourse by challenging traditional norms. Increased literacy rates during the Enlightenment democratized criticism, allowing diverse voices to emerge.
>>Educator: Right! And you know what? When students see that their interpretations are valued just as much as those from established critics, it boosts their confidence and creativity.
>>Philosopher: That's so true! It reminds me of how we approach reinterpretation in philosophy—it's all about seeing things from new angles.
>>Literary Critic: Exactly! This act challenges traditional norms and encourages innovative approaches in literary criticism. I attended a seminar where students reinterpreted classic texts through contemporary social issues—the depth they brought was fascinating!
>>Historian: Well, if we look at it historically, such reinterpretations have always been part of literary evolution. Increased literacy rates during the Enlightenment democratized criticism, allowing diverse voices to challenge traditional norms.
>>Educator: Speaking from experience, I've seen students come up with some truly groundbreaking insights when they're encouraged to think outside the box like this. 
 >>Literary Critic: Um, exploring nontraditional texts and women's literature really enriches our understanding and challenges conventional boundaries in literary criticism. Integrating these voices into our curricula can foster deeper connections with students' learning experiences.
>>Philosopher: That's an interesting point! From my perspective, engaging with these diverse voices represents a significant shift in how we experience literature philosophically. How do you think we can best integrate these perspectives into our academic discourse?
>>Historian: Historically speaking, this shift towards including nontraditional texts has been crucial in broadening literary criticism. It's fascinating how these voices challenge established norms—do you have any specific examples that highlight this evolution?
>>Educator: Absolutely! I think incorporating authors like Toni Morrison or Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie could really enhance our curriculum. What strategies do you suggest for making sure students connect deeply with these works?
>>Literary Critic: Indeed! Using Morrison's ""Beloved"" as a core text could be powerful—it not only enriches understanding but also challenges traditional narratives about history and identity.
>>Philosopher: Exactly! And creating spaces for open discussions around such texts will help honor their multiplicity of perspectives. How can we ensure these discussions are inclusive?
>>Historian: Well, considering how Morrison's work has historically democratized literary discourse by giving voice to marginalized communities might be one approach. What other methods could we use?
>>Educator: Right! So we've agreed on exploring areas like Morrison's work further—let’s plan some workshops around her novels to shape future discussions!"
