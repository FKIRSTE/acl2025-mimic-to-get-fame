Astrophysics,"Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena.[1][2] As one of  the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, astrophysics ""seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space—what they are, rather than where they are"",[3] which is studied in celestial mechanics.

Among the subjects studied are the Sun (solar physics), other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium, and the cosmic microwave background.[4][5] Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include the properties of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe.[4] Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity, special relativity, and quantum and physical cosmology (the physical study of the largest-scale structures of the universe), including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.

Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the Aristotelian worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging spheres whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent growth and decay and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its goal.  Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either Fire as maintained by Plato, or Aether as maintained by Aristotle.[6][7]
During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as Galileo,[8] Descartes,[9] and Newton[10] began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws.[11]  Their challenge was that the tools had not yet been invented with which to prove these assertions.[12]

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.[13][14]  A new astronomy, soon to be called astrophysics, began to emerge when William Hyde Wollaston and Joseph von Fraunhofer independently discovered that, when decomposing the light from the Sun, a multitude of dark lines (regions where there was less or no light) were observed in the spectrum.[15] By 1860 the physicist, Gustav Kirchhoff, and the chemist, Robert Bunsen, had demonstrated that the dark lines in the solar spectrum corresponded to bright lines in the spectra of known gases, specific lines corresponding to unique chemical elements.[16] Kirchhoff deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the Solar atmosphere.[17] In this way it was proved that the chemical elements found in the Sun and stars were also found on Earth.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was Norman Lockyer, who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist Edward Frankland to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements.  He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called helium, after the Greek Helios, the Sun personified.[18][19]

In 1885, Edward C. Pickering undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at Harvard College Observatory, in which a team of woman computers, notably Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, and Annie Jump Cannon, classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the catalog to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the Harvard Classification Scheme which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.[20]

In 1895, George Ellery Hale and James E. Keeler, along with a group of ten associate editors from Europe and the United States,[21]  established The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics.[22]  It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.[21]

Around 1920, following the discovery of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper The Internal Constitution of the Stars.[23][24] At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation E = mc2. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity), had not yet been discovered.[25]

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at Radcliffe College, in which she applied Saha's ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.[26]  Most significantly, she discovered that hydrogen and helium were the principal components of stars, not the composition of Earth. Despite Eddington's suggestion, discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers (including Russell) convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication. However, later research confirmed her discovery.[27][28]

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.[29] In the 21st century, it further expanded to include observations based on gravitational waves.

Observational astronomy is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with theoretical astrophysics, which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus.

Most astrophysical observations are made using the electromagnetic spectrum.

Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few gravitational wave observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. Neutrino observatories have also been built, primarily to study the Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high-energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning centuries or millennia. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale (millisecond pulsars) or combine years of data (pulsar deceleration studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of the Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Understanding the Sun serves as a guide to understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.[30][31]

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Relativistic astrophysics serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large-scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves.

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the Lambda-CDM model, are the Big Bang, cosmic inflation, dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.

The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.[11]  There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics.  In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the Royal Astronomical Society and notable educators such as prominent professors Lawrence Krauss, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Stephen Hawking, Hubert Reeves, Carl Sagan and Patrick Moore. The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.[32][33][34]
The television sitcom show The Big Bang Theory popularized the field of astrophysics with the general public, and featured some well known scientists like Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

>>Science Communicator: There were so many creative ideas! One group even made a model of the solar system with moving parts. It was really impressive.

>>Physics Educator: Oh, that reminds me of a fun experience I had with my students recently. We built simple spectroscopes using CDs and cardboard. You should have seen their faces light up when they saw the different colors in the light spectrum!

>>Astrophysicist: That's fantastic! I recently observed a supernova remnant through a high-powered telescope. The sheer magnitude of the explosion and the intricate details of the remnants were just mind-blowing!

>>Historian of Science: Wow, that's really interesting! I came across an old journal entry from the early 20th century detailing the first observations of a supernova. It's amazing how much we've learned since then.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely fascinating! Speaking of learning, I also visited a local science museum recently. They had this interactive exhibit on the electromagnetic spectrum, and it was amazing to see how engaged everyone was, especially the kids.

>>Astronomer: That sounds great! I've been working on some new observational techniques lately. It's always thrilling to see how technology can open up new windows into our universe.

>>Physics Educator: Definitely! Last week we did an experiment on gravitational waves where we used laser pointers to demonstrate interference patterns. It was so rewarding to see my students grasp such a complex concept through hands-on activities.

>>Astrophysicist: Those kinds of experiences really ignite curiosity in young minds. Observing celestial phenomena firsthand can be truly transformative.

>>Historian of Science: Indeed! It's remarkable how historical discoveries continue to inspire us today. Those early astronomers laid so much groundwork for what we understand now.

>>Science Communicator: Exactly! And it's our job to keep that spark alive for future generations by making science accessible and engaging. 
 >>Astrophysicist: Speaking of keeping the spark alive, I recently had the opportunity to observe a neutron star merger. The data we collected is simply incredible. To put it in perspective, these events are like cosmic fireworks, releasing more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire lifetime!

>>Historian of Science: It's fascinating how these cosmic events have always captured our imagination. The discovery of neutron stars was huge back in the 1960s. What can we learn from this latest observation?

>>Science Communicator: Wow! That's incredible! Public engagement with such discoveries is crucial because it inspires future scientists.

>>Physics Educator: Alright, let's break it down step by step. The energy released in a neutron star merger is mind-boggling! Think about it this way: it's like taking all the energy our Sun will produce over its entire lifetime and releasing it in just a few seconds. Does that make sense?

>>Astronomer: And to capture these events, we rely on synchronized telescopes across the globe, showcasing our advanced technological capabilities.

>>Astrophysicist: I completely agree! And it's not just about technology but also about teamwork among international teams.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely! Sharing these cosmic fireworks with the public helps spark curiosity and interest in science.

The data we collected not only helps us understand these cosmic events but also pushes the boundaries of our current technological capabilities. It's truly amazing! 
 >>Historian of Science: To really get this, we need to look at what was happening back then. The precision and technological advancements we see today are built upon the foundational work of early astronomers like Galileo and Newton.

>>Science Communicator: Isn't it amazing how they made those discoveries with such basic tools? Galileo used a simple telescope to observe Jupiter's moons. It's hard to imagine doing that now with just a basic setup.

>>Astrophysicist: Absolutely! When you think about it, Galileo's observations fundamentally altered our understanding of the cosmos. And Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation were game-changers too.

>>Physics Educator: Right, and then you have people like Eddington who took things even further with insights into stellar processes. They were building on what came before them, layer by layer.

>>Science Communicator: It's fascinating to see how each scientist built on their predecessors' work. Eddington’s ideas about nuclear fusion in stars were ahead of his time, and Payne-Gaposchkin’s discoveries about star compositions changed everything.

>>Astrophysicist: Exactly! Eddington had this profound understanding of stellar processes even without direct evidence. And Payne-Gaposchkin showed us that hydrogen and helium are the main components of stars, which was revolutionary.

>>Historian of Science: The historical context is crucial here. Eddington’s leap in understanding wasn't just about new knowledge but also about using the scientific method—hypothesizing first then seeking evidence. Payne-Gaposchkin faced skepticism but ultimately reshaped our comprehension fundamentally.

>>Physics Educator: It shows how science evolves through challenges and breakthroughs over time. Each discovery builds on the last one, pushing our understanding further.

>>Astronomer: And skepticism plays such an essential role in scientific progress too. It forces scientists to rigorously test their ideas before they're accepted.

>>Science Communicator: Imagine being one of those scientists—like cosmic detectives uncovering new worlds despite all odds!

>>Astrophysicist: Indeed! The skepticism Payne-Gaposchkin faced is a testament to scientific progress itself—each discovery challenging existing paradigms paving ways for new understandings. 
 >>Astronomer: With the advancements in observational techniques, we've been able to detect phenomena like gravitational waves. These ripples in spacetime, first predicted by Einstein, have opened up a new way of observing the universe.

>>Science Communicator: It's incredible how these technological advancements are allowing us to see the universe in ways we never imagined. It's like upgrading from an old black-and-white TV to a high-definition screen! The details we're uncovering now are just mind-blowing!

>>Astrophysicist: Absolutely. Our theoretical models for dark matter and dark energy have become more refined thanks to these observations. For instance, gravitational lensing has provided indirect evidence of dark matter's presence by showing how it bends light from distant galaxies.

>>Historian of Science: Historically, the interplay between theory and observation has always driven scientific progress. Early astronomers like Galileo used rudimentary telescopes to validate their theories. This shows that continuously improving our tools is essential for advancing our understanding of the cosmos.

>>Physics Educator: Let's break it down step by step. These technological advancements not only improve our observational capabilities but also enhance our theoretical models. Better data from observations like gravitational waves help us refine our theories about dark matter and dark energy.

>>Physics Educator: Exactly! With better data from observations like gravitational waves, we can make our theories more accurate and predictive.

>>Astrophysicist: To put it simply, theoretical predictions guide our observations while new data helps us improve our models. This back-and-forth process is crucial for deepening our understanding of phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.

>>Science Communicator: And it's fascinating how these advancements inspire the next generation of scientists. Every new discovery is like a puzzle piece that helps us see the bigger picture of our universe!

>>Astronomer: The detection of gravitational waves has truly revolutionized our understanding of the universe. These waves allow us to observe cosmic events that were previously invisible, like black hole mergers. This opens up so many possibilities for future discoveries.

>>Historian of Science: Indeed! The historical context shows us that early astronomers could only dream of the precision we have today. The relentless pursuit of knowledge and improvement in technology has always driven our understanding forward. 
 >>Physics Educator: Alright, let's break it down step by step. Spectral analysis is like a fingerprint for stars. By examining the light they emit, we can identify the chemical elements present, just like how Kirchhoff and Bunsen did with their pioneering work.

>>Astrophysicist: This technique has revealed that elements found on Earth are also present in distant stars. It's amazing how we can decode starlight to find out what they're made of.

>>Historian of Science: Indeed! Kirchhoff and Bunsen's work in the mid-19th century was groundbreaking because it allowed us to identify elements in stars and other celestial bodies.

>>Science Communicator: That's fascinating! Spectral analysis really is like having a cosmic detective kit. By analyzing the light from stars, we can uncover their secrets and understand what they're made of.

>>Astronomer: The precision of spectral analysis is truly impressive. By examining the light from stars, we can determine their chemical composition with remarkable accuracy. What does this tell us about the processes happening within these stars?

>>Physics Educator: Well, it's all about understanding those unique fingerprints each element leaves behind in starlight. When you see certain lines in a star's spectrum, you know exactly what elements are there.

>>Astrophysicist: Exactly! And what's really amazing is how we've used this technique to discover new elements too—like helium was first identified in the Sun before it was found on Earth!

>>Historian of Science: That's right! Kirchhoff and Bunsen's discovery paved the way for such incredible findings and helped us understand stellar compositions better.

>>Science Communicator: Imagine being able to tell what something millions of miles away is made of just by looking at its light—it's like magic but backed by science!

>>Astronomer: Actually, it's quite methodical when you think about it. Each element absorbs or emits light at specific wavelengths—those patterns are unmistakable.

>>Physics Educator: Let's see... it's kind of like using a magnifying glass to read tiny print—you get all these details that were invisible before.

>>Astrophysicist: And with advancements in technology, our ability to analyze these spectra has become even more precise. We're now able to study not just individual stars but entire galaxies!

>>Historian of Science: Remarkable progress indeed! The foundation laid by Kirchhoff and Bunsen continues to support modern astrophysics today.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely! It's so important for people to realize how interconnected everything is—from historical discoveries to cutting-edge research today. 
 >>Astrophysicist: You know, shows like 'The Big Bang Theory' have really brought complex scientific concepts into mainstream conversations. They often spark curiosity and inspire future generations to explore the cosmos.

>>Historian of Science: That's true. If we look back in history, popular culture has always played a role in shaping public interest in science. During the Space Race era, TV broadcasts of space missions captivated millions and inspired many to pursue careers in science and engineering. It's interesting to see how media can influence career choices.

>>Science Communicator: Yeah, I think it's because these shows blend humor with real scientific concepts, making them accessible and fun! Like when Sheldon explains string theory—it’s hilarious but also educational.

>>Physics Educator: Exactly! When popular culture incorporates scientific concepts, it makes them more approachable. For instance, 'The Big Bang Theory' uses humor to demystify complex ideas, which can be really effective for engaging people who might find science intimidating otherwise.

>>Astronomer: Right, but I wonder if there's a downside too. Sometimes these shows oversimplify or misrepresent scientific concepts for the sake of entertainment. Do you think that could lead to misconceptions?

>>Astrophysicist: That's a good point. While they do make science more accessible, there’s always a risk of oversimplification. But overall, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks because they get people interested in learning more.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely! And it's not just about getting facts right—it's about sparking that initial curiosity. Once someone is interested, they can dig deeper on their own.

>>Historian of Science: Indeed! And if we compare different eras, like the Space Race and now with shows like 'The Big Bang Theory,' we see that media continues to play a crucial role in inspiring scientific curiosity across generations.

>>Physics Educator: Speaking of inspiration, I remember watching Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' as a kid—that show was my gateway into physics. It made me realize how fascinating the universe is!

>>Astronomer: Oh yes! Personal experiences like that are so powerful. For me, it was watching documentaries about space missions that got me hooked on astronomy. 
 >>Science Communicator: That's awesome! You know, I once met a kid at a science fair who was so excited about black holes that he made his own mini model using a spinning top and some marbles. It was incredible!

>>Astrophysicist: It's fascinating how the study of black holes has evolved. We went from just theorizing about them to actually capturing images with the Event Horizon Telescope. It's like peering into the very fabric of space-time.

>>Historian of Science: Yeah, it really shows how much progress we've made. Black holes were once just theoretical ideas, but now we can actually see them thanks to advancements in technology.

>>Science Communicator: So, speaking of black holes, have you ever thought about how they might be connected to wormholes? It's like something straight out of science fiction!

>>Physics Educator: Black holes and wormholes are fascinating because they challenge our understanding of space-time. A black hole is like a cosmic vacuum cleaner, while a wormhole could be a shortcut through the universe. Does that make sense?

>>Astrophysicist: Indeed! If black holes are like cosmic traps, wormholes could be bridges connecting distant points in space-time. The possibilities are incredible!

>>Science Communicator: It's funny how black holes and wormholes sound like something out of a sci-fi movie but they're real phenomena we study! Have you ever thought about what it would be like to travel through a wormhole? Imagine the adventure!

>>Astrophysicist: The idea of traveling through a wormhole is indeed fascinating. It's like imagining a shortcut through the vast expanse of the universe, bypassing conventional constraints of space and time. But it's also important to consider the immense gravitational forces and potential instability within such structures.

>>Historian of Science: You know, Einstein and Rosen proposed the idea of 'bridges' in space-time back in 1935. These concepts have been around for quite some time and continue to captivate our imagination.

>>Astronomer: And while it's exciting to think about traveling through them, we have to remember that these ideas are still largely theoretical. We don't yet have any practical means or evidence that such travel is possible.

>>Physics Educator: True! But isn't it amazing how these concepts push us to think beyond our current limitations? They inspire new generations to explore and question what's possible.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely! And that's why I love talking about this stuff with people outside our field too—it's all so mind-blowing! 
 >>Astrophysicist: The universe always surprises us! Every new find feels like opening a new chapter.

>>Historian of Science: Right, and every discovery builds on what came before, from Galileo's first look through a telescope to today's James Webb images. It's amazing to see the progression.

>>Science Communicator: Absolutely! And thinking about how these discoveries will inspire future generations is really exciting. What do you all think?

>>Physics Educator: It's incredible how interconnected all these discoveries are. They really pave the way for future research and understanding.

>>Astronomer: Yeah, it's been quite enlightening. How do you all feel about our progress from Galileo's time to now?

>>Historian of Science: It's truly remarkable. Each step—from Galileo's observations to modern telescopes—shows our relentless curiosity and drive. We can learn so much from this journey.

>>Astrophysicist: Definitely! The universe keeps us on our toes with its infinite mysteries. So, any final thoughts or questions before we wrap up?

>>Science Communicator: This has been such an enlightening discussion! Any last comments or questions before we call it a day?

>>Physics Educator: I think we've covered everything pretty well today. It's amazing how each discovery leads to another, creating a continuous journey of exploration.

>>Astronomer: Actually, yeah—just one more thing before we go. When do you all want to meet next? It'd be great if we could keep this momentum going!"
