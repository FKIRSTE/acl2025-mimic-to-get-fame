Gentrification,"

Gentrification is the process whereby the character of a neighborhood changes through the influx of more affluent residents (the ""gentry"") and investment.[1][2] There is no agreed-upon definition of gentrification.[3][4] In public discourse, it has been used to describe a wide array of phenomena, sometimes in a pejorative connotation.[4]

Gentrification is a common and controversial topic in urban politics and planning. Gentrification often increases the economic value of a neighborhood, but can be controversial due to changing demographic composition and potential displacement of incumbent residents.[1] Gentrification is more likely when there is an undersupply of housing and rising home values in a metropolitan area.[5]

The gentrification process is typically the result of increasing attraction to an area by people with higher incomes spilling over from neighboring cities, towns, or neighborhoods. Further steps are increased investments in a community and the related infrastructure by real estate development businesses, local government, or community activists and resulting economic development, increased attraction of business, and lower crime rates.

Historians say that gentrification took place in ancient Rome and in Roman Britain, where large villas were replacing small shops by the 3rd century, AD.[6] The word gentrification derives from gentry—which comes from the Old French word genterise, ""of gentle birth"" (14th century) and ""people of gentle birth"" (16th century). In England, landed gentry denoted the social class, consisting of gentlemen (and gentlewomen, as they were at that time known).[7]

A more direct derivational base of gentrification is the 19th-century neologism 'gentrify,' a verb coined by Samuel Laing (1780–1868). This term reflected shifting societal attitudes—specifically, the idea that one could attain upper-class status through conduct rather than birth—while also introducing undertones of conspicuous consumption and pretentiousness.[8]

British sociologist Ruth Glass was first to use ""gentrification"" in its current sense.[1] She used it in 1964 to describe the influx of middle-class people displacing lower-class worker residents in urban neighborhoods; her example was London, and its working-class districts such as Islington:[9]

One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been invaded by the middle-classes—upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottages—two rooms up and two down—have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences ... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.
In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report Health Effects of Gentrification defines the real estate concept of gentrification as ""the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value.""[10] A real estate encyclopedia defines gentrification as ""the process by which central urban neighborhoods that have undergone disinvestments and economic decline experience a reversal, reinvestment, and the in-migration of a well-off middle- and upper-middle-class population.""[11][12]

Scholars and pundits have applied a variety of definitions to gentrification since 1964, some oriented around gentrifiers, others oriented around the displaced, and some a combination of both. The first category include the Hackworth (2002) definition ""the production of space for progressively more affluent users"".[page needed] The second category include Kasman's definition ""the reduction of residential and retail space affordable to low-income residents"".[13] The final category includes Rose, who describes gentrification as a process ""in which members of the 'new middle class' move into and physically and culturally reshape working-class inner city neighbourhoods"".[14]

Kennedy & Leonard (2001) say in their Brookings Institution report that ""the term 'gentrification' is both imprecise and quite politically charged"", suggesting its redefinition as ""the process by which higher income households displace lower income residents of a neighborhood, changing the essential character and flavour of that neighborhood"", so distinguishing it from the different socio-economic process of ""neighborhood (or urban) revitalization"", although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Kitis (2024) argues that Glass's original use of the word employs a war metaphor to emphasize the 'displacement of lower-income residents' as central—a class-struggle meaning that risks being sidelined in its continued use to denote processes of 'urban change' or 'improvement.'

Gentrification has been described as a natural cycle: the well-to-do prefer to live in the newest housing stock. Each decade of a city's growth, a new ring of housing is built. When the housing at the center has reached the end of its useful life and becomes cheap, the well-to-do gentrify the neighborhood. The push outward from the city center continues as the housing in each ring reaches the end of its economic life.[15] They observe that gentrification has three interpretations: (a) ""great, the value of my house is going up, (b) coffee is more expensive, now that we have a Starbucks, and (c) my neighbors and I can no longer afford to live here (community displacement)"".[16]

Palen & London (1984) compiled five explanations for gentrification since the 1970s:

Other explanations propose that as people tire of the automobile-dependent urban sprawl style of life, they move to urban areas,[19] in particular to homes near public transit stations.[20][19][21] The increase in professional jobs in the central business district has increased demand for living in urban areas according to Ley (1980). Critical geographers have argued that capital flows and developers have been instrumental in causing gentrification.[22][23][24]

The de-industrialization of cities in developed nations may have caused displacement by reducing the number of blue-collar jobs available to the urban working class and middle-class.

Some have argued that the counterculture movement in the 1960s created disdain for the ""standardization of look-alike suburbs"", prompting people to live in urban areas.[25] Others argue that a desire to live near cultural attractions prompts gentrification.[26]

According to a 2020 systematic review of existing research, gentrification in the United States has led to a short-term reduction in crime in gentrifying neighborhoods. However, it noted that there is little evidence for more long-term impacts and that gentrification in some cases widens crime-related disparities.[27]

Displacement is often seen as a key effect of gentrification, although evidence is mixed as to whether gentrification leads to displacement (or even reduces displacement) and under which circumstances.[28][29] In 2005, USA Today claimed that gentrification is a ""boost for everyone"" based on the impact of some recent studies and that displacement that arises is minimal, or caused by other factors. Some scholars have disputed these assertions, arguing that such studies distort facts and used limited datasets.[30] In 2002, economist Jacob Vigdor wrote, ""Overall, existing literature has failed to convincingly demonstrate that rates of involuntary displacement are higher in gentrifying neighborhoods.""[3]

A 2018 study found evidence that gentrification displaces renters, but not homeowners.[31] The displacement of low-income rental residents is commonly referenced as a negative aspect of gentrification by its opponents.[32] A 2022 study found evidence that gentrification leads to greater residential mobility.[33]

In the United States, a 2023 study by Princeton University sociologists found that ""eviction rates decreased more in gentrifying neighborhoods than in comparable low-income neighborhoods.""[34] A 2016 study found ""that vulnerable residents, those with low credit scores and without mortgages, are generally no more likely to move from gentrifying neighborhoods compared with their counterparts in nongentrifying neighborhoods.""[35] A 2017 study by sociology professor Matthew Desmond, who runs Princeton University's Eviction Lab, ""found no evidence that renters residing in gentrifying or in racially- and economically-integrated neighborhoods had a higher likelihood of eviction.""[36][4] A 2020 study which followed children from low-income families in New York found no evidence that gentrification was associated with changes in mobility rates. The study also found ""that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas.""[37]

A 2023 study by economists at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that the construction of new large apartment buildings in low-income neighborhoods lead to an influx of high-income households but also decrease rents in nearby units by increasing housing supply.[38]

Many of the social effects of gentrification have been based on extensive theories about how socioeconomic status of an individual's neighborhood will shape one's behavior and future. These studies have prompted ""social mix policies"" to be widely adopted by governments to promote the process and its positive effects, such as lessening the strain on public resources that are associated with de-concentrating poverty. However, more specific research has shown that gentrification does not necessarily correlate with ""social mixing"", and that the effects of the new composition of a gentrified neighborhood can both weaken as well as strengthen community cohesion.[39]

Housing confers social status, and the changing norms that accompany gentrification translate to a changing social hierarchy.[23] The process of gentrification mixes people of different socioeconomic strata, thereby congregating a variety of expectations and social norms. The change gentrification brings in class distinction also has been shown to contribute to residential polarization by income, education, household composition, and race.[23] It conveys a social rise that brings new standards in consumption, particularly in the form of excess and superfluity, to the area that were not held by the pre-existing residents.[23] These differing norms can lead to conflict, which potentially serves to divide changing communities.[39] Often this comes at a larger social cost to the original residents of the gentrified area whose displacement is met with little concern from the gentry or the government.[40] Clashes that result in increased police surveillance, for example, would more adversely affect young minorities who are also more likely to be the original residents of the area.[39]

There is also evidence to support that gentrification can strengthen and stabilize when there is a consensus about a community's objectives. Gentrifiers with an organized presence in deteriorated neighborhoods can demand and receive better resources.[39] A characteristic example is a combined community effort to win historic district designation for the neighborhood, a phenomenon that is often linked to gentrification activity.[26] Gentry can exert a peer influence on neighbors to take action against crime, which can lead to even more price increases in changing neighborhoods when crime rates drop and optimism for the area's future climbs.[26]

Some argue that gentrification is associated with the decline of distinctive local businesses and the rise of chains and franchises.[41][42]

Rehabilitation movements have been largely successful at restoring the plentiful supply of old and deteriorated housing that is readily available in inner cities. This rehabilitation can be seen as a superior alternative to expansion, for the location of the central city offers an intact infrastructure that should be taken advantage of: streets, public transportation, and other urban facilities.[26] Furthermore, the changed perception of the central city that is encouraged by gentrification can be healthy for resource-deprived communities who have previously been largely ignored.[26] Gentrifiers provide the political effectiveness needed to draw more government funding towards physical and social area improvements,[43] while improving the overall quality of life by providing a larger tax base.[44]

Communities have strong ties to the history and culture of their neighborhood, and causing its dispersal can have detrimental costs.[10]

The economic changes that occur as a community goes through gentrification are often favorable for local governments. Affluent gentrifiers expand the local tax base as well as support local shops and businesses, a large part of why the process is frequently alluded to in urban policies. The decrease in vacancy rates and increase in property value that accompany the process can work to stabilize a previously struggling community, restoring interest in inner-city life as a residential option alongside the suburbs.[26] These changes can create positive feedback as well, encouraging other forms of development of the area that promote general economic growth.

Home ownership is a significant variable when it comes to economic impacts of gentrification. People who own their homes are much more able to gain financial benefits of gentrification than those who rent their houses and can be displaced without much compensation.[45]

Economic pressure and market price changes relate to the speed of gentrification. English-speaking countries have a higher number of property owners and a higher mobility. German speaking countries provide a higher share of rented property and have a much stronger role of municipalities, cooperatives, guilds and unions offering low-price-housing. The effect is a lower speed of gentrification and a broader social mix. Gerhard Hard sees gentrification as a typical 1970s term with more visibility in public discourse than actual migration.[46]

A 2017 study found that gentrification leads to job gains overall, with job losses in proximate locations but job gains further away.[47] A 2014 study found that gentrification led to job gains in the gentrifying neighborhood.[48]

A 2016 study found that residents who stay in gentrifying neighborhoods go on to obtain higher credit scores whereas residents who leave gentrifying neighborhoods obtain lower credit scores.[49]

""School gentrification"" is characterized by: (i) increased numbers of middle-class families; (ii) material and physical upgrades (e.g. new programs, educational resources, and infrastructural improvements); (iii) forms of exclusion and/or the marginalization of low-income students and families (e.g. in both enrollment and social relations); and (iv) changes in school culture and climate (e.g. traditions, expectations, and social dynamics).[50]

A 2024 study found that adding high-density mixed-income developments to low-income neighborhoods in London, United Kingdom, led to improved educational outcomes for the children who were already living in the neighborhood. The plausible mechanism for this effect is that incumbent students were exposed to more high-ability students.[51]

In Chicago, among neighborhood public schools located in areas that did undergo gentrification, one study found that schools experience no aggregate academic benefit from the socioeconomic changes occurring around them,[52] despite improvements in other public services such street repair, sanitation, policing, and firefighting. The lack of gentrification-related benefits to schools may be related to the finding that white gentrifiers often do not enroll their children in local neighborhood public schools.[53]

Programs and policies designed to attract gentrifying families to historically disinvested schools may have unintended negative consequences, including an unbalanced landscape of influence wherein the voices and priorities of more affluent parents are privileged over those of lower-income families.[54] In addition, rising enrollment of higher-income families in neighborhood schools can result in the political and cultural displacement of long-term residents in school decision-making processes and the loss of Title I funding.[55] Notably, the expansion of school choice (e.g., charter schools, magnet schools, open enrollment policies) have been found to significantly increase the likelihood that college-educated white households gentrify low-income communities of color.[56]

A culmination of recent research suggests that gentrification has both detrimental and beneficial effects on health.[12]

A 2020 review found that studies tended to show adverse health impacts for Black residents and elderly residents in areas undergoing gentrification.[57]

A 2019 study in New York, found that gentrification has no impact on rates of asthma or obesity among low-income children. Growing up in gentrifying neighborhoods was associated with moderate increases in being diagnosed with anxiety or depression between ages 9–11 relative to similar children raised in non-gentrifying areas. The effects of gentrification on mental health were most prominent for children living in market-rate (rather than subsidized) housing, which lead the authors of the study to suggest financial stress as a possible mechanism.[58]

Preventing or mitigating gentrification is thought to be a method to promote health equity.[59]

Whether gentrification has occurred in a census tract in an urban area in the United States during a particular 10-year period between censuses can be determined by a method used in a study by Governing:[60] If the census tract in a central city had 500 or more residents and at the time of the baseline census had median household income and median home value in the bottom 40th percentile and at the time of the next 10-year census the tract's educational attainment (percentage of residents over age 25 with a bachelor's degree) was in the top 33rd percentile; the median home value, adjusted for inflation, had increased; and the percentage of increase in home values in the tract was in the top 33rd percentile when compared to the increase in other census tracts in the urban area then it was considered to have been gentrified. The method measures the rate of gentrification, not the degree of gentrification; thus, San Francisco, which has a history of gentrification dating to the 1970s, show a decreasing rate between 1990 and 2010.[61]

Scholars have also identified census indicators that can be used to reveal that gentrification is taking place in a given area, including a drop in the number of children per household, increased education among residents, the number of non-traditional types of households, and a general upwards shift in income.[62]

Just as critical to the gentrification process as creating a favorable environment is the availability of the 'gentry,' or those who will be first-stage gentrifiers. The typical gentrifiers are affluent and have professional-level, service industry jobs, many of which involve self-employment.[63] Therefore, they are willing and able to take the investment risk in the housing market. Often they are single people or young couples without children who lack demand for good schools.[23] Gentrifiers are likely searching for inexpensive housing close to the workplace and often already reside in the inner city, sometimes for educational reasons, and do not want to make the move to suburbia. For this demographic, gentrification is not so much the result of a return to the inner city but is more of a positive action to remain there.[63]

The stereotypical gentrifiers also have shared consumer preferences and favor a largely consumerist culture. This fuels the rapid expansion of trendy restaurant, shopping, and entertainment spheres that often accompany the gentrification process.[23] Holcomb and Beauregard described these groups as those who are ""attracted by low prices and toleration of an unconventional lifestyle"".[64]

An interesting find from research on those who participate and initiate the gentrification process, the ""marginal gentrifiers"" as referred to by Tim Butler, is that they become marginalized by the expansion of the process.[63]

Research shows how one reason wealthy, upper-class individuals and families hold some responsibility in the causation of gentrification is due to their social mobility.[65] Wealthier families were more likely to have more financial freedom to move into urban areas, oftentimes choosing to do so for their work. At the same time, in these urban areas the lower-income population is decreasing due to an increase in the elderly population as well as demographic change.[65]

Jackelyn Hwang and Jeffrey Lin have supported in their research that another reason for the influx of upper-class individuals to urban areas is due to the ""increase in demand for college-educated workers"".[66] It is because of this demand that wealthier individuals with college degrees needed to move into urban cities for work, increasing prices in housing as the demand has grown. Additionally, Darren P. Smith finds through his research that college-educated workers moving into the urban areas causes them to settle there and raise children, which eventually contributes to the cost of education in regards to the migration between urban and suburban places.[67]

Women increasingly obtaining higher education as well as higher paying jobs has increased their participation in the labor force, translating to an expansion of women who have greater opportunities to invest. Smith suggests this group ""represents a reservoir of potential gentrifiers.""[63] The increasing number of highly educated women play into this theory, given that residence in the inner city can give women access to the well-paying jobs and networking, something that is becoming increasingly common.[26]

There are also theories that suggest the inner-city lifestyle is important for women with children where the father does not care equally for the child, because of the proximity to professional childcare.[63] This attracts single parents, specifically single mothers, to the inner-city as opposed to suburban areas where resources are more geographically spread out. This is often deemed as ""marginal gentrification"", for the city can offer an easier solution to combining paid and unpaid labor. Inner city concentration increases the efficiency of commodities parents need by minimizing time constraints among multiple jobs, childcare, and markets.[26]

Phillip Clay's two-stage model of gentrification places artists as prototypical stage one or ""marginal"" gentrifiers. The National Endowment for the Arts did a study that linked the proportion of employed artists to the rate of inner city gentrification across a number of U.S. cities.[25] Artists will typically accept the risks of rehabilitating deteriorated property, as well as having the time, skill, and ability to carry out these extensive renovations.[26] David Ley states that the artist's critique of everyday life and search for meaning and renewal are what make them early recruits for gentrification.

The identity that residence in the inner city provides is important for the gentrifier, and this is particularly so in the artists' case. Their cultural emancipation from the bourgeois makes the central city an appealing alternative that distances them from the conformity and mundanity attributed to suburban life. They are quintessential city people, and the city is often a functional choice as well, for city life has advantages that include connections to customers and a closer proximity to a downtown art scene, all of which are more likely to be limited in a suburban setting. Ley's research cites a quote from a Vancouver printmaker talking about the importance of inner city life to an artist, that it has, ""energy, intensity, hard to specify but hard to do without"".[25]

Ironically, these attributes that make artists characteristic marginal gentrifiers form the same foundations for their isolation as the gentrification process matures. The later stages of the process generate an influx of more affluent, ""yuppie"" residents. As the bohemian character of the community grows, it appeals ""not only to committed participants, but also to sporadic consumers,""[68] and the rising property values that accompany this migration often lead to the eventual pushing out of the artists that began the movement in the first place.[26]   Sharon Zukin's study of SoHo in Manhattan, NYC was one of the most famous cases of this phenomenon. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Manhattan lofts in SoHo were converted en masse into housing for artists and hippies, and then their sub-culture's followers.[69]

Artists, writers, musicians, affluent college students, LGBT, hipsters and political activists move in to a neighborhood for its affordability and tolerance.

Upper-middle-class professionals, often politically liberal-progressive (e.g. teachers, journalists, librarians), are attracted by the vibrancy created by the first arrivals.

Wealthier people (e.g. private sector managers) move in and real estate prices increase significantly. By this stage, high prices have excluded traditional residents and most of the types of people who arrived in stage 1 & 2.

Manuel Castells has researched the role of gay communities, especially in San Francisco, as early gentrifiers.[70]  The film Quinceañera depicts a similar situation in Los Angeles. Flag Wars (Linda Goode Bryant)[71] shows tensions as of 2003 between bourgeois White LGBT-newcomers and a Black middle-class neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio.[72] In Washington, D.C.  Black and other ethnic minority mixed-income community residents accused both the affluent majority-White LGBTQ+ community and the closely linked hipster subculture of cultural displacement (or destruction of cultural heritage) under the guise of progressive inclusion and tolerance.[73][74]

Evidence from Buenos Aires, shows that predominantly LGBTQ+ areas were only able to exist when the government allowed that area to be gentrified.[75]

Today, practically all historic gayborhoods have become less LGBTQ+ centric mainly due to the modern effects of gentrification.[76] Gay neighborhoods may reveal elements of classism and racism perpetuated by affluent white gay men who settle in spaces that drive out people of color—through rent being raised in the area.[77] The rising cost to live in gayborhoods and government use of eminent domain have displaced many LGBTQ+ people and closed many LGBTQ+ centric businesses.[78][79][80][81]

To counter the gentrification of their mixed-populace communities, there are cases where residents formally organized themselves to develop the necessary socio-political strategies required to retain local affordable housing. The gentrification of a mixed-income community raises housing affordability to the fore of the community's politics.[82] There are cities, municipalities, and counties which have countered gentrification with inclusionary zoning (inclusionary housing) ordinances requiring the apportionment of some new housing for the community's original low- and moderate-income residents. Inclusionary zoning is a new social concept in English speaking countries; there are few reports qualifying its effective or ineffective limitation of gentrification in the English literature. The basis of inclusionary zoning is partial replacement as opposed to displacement of the embedded communities.[83]

German (speaking) municipalities have a strong legal role in zoning and on the real estate market in general and a long tradition of integrating social aspects in planning schemes and building regulations. The German approach uses en (milieu conservation municipal law), e.g. in Munich's Lehel district in use since the 1960s. The concepts of socially aware renovation and zoning of Bologna's old city in 1974 was used as role model in the Charta of Bologna, and recognized by the Council of Europe.[84]

Most economists do not think anti-gentrification measures by the government make cities better off.[85][additional citation(s) needed]

When wealthy people move into low-income working-class neighborhoods, the resulting class conflict sometimes involves vandalism and arson targeting the property of the gentrifiers. During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, the gentrification of San Francisco's predominantly working class Mission District led some long-term neighborhood residents to create what they called the ""Mission Yuppie Eradication Project"".[86] This group allegedly destroyed property and called for property destruction as part of a strategy to oppose gentrification. Their activities drew hostile responses from the San Francisco Police Department, real estate interests, and ""work-within-the-system"" housing activists.[87]

Meibion Glyndŵr (Welsh: Sons of Glyndŵr), also known as the Valley Commandos, was a Welsh nationalist movement violently opposed to the loss of Welsh culture and language. They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of second homes being bought by the English which had increased house prices beyond the means of many locals. The group were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s. In the first wave of attacks, eight holiday homes were destroyed in a month, and in 1980, Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in Operation Tân. Within the next ten years, some 220 properties were damaged by the campaign.[88] Since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased. In 1989 there was a movement that protested an influx of Swabians to Berlin who were deemed as gentrification drivers. Berlin saw the Schwabenhass and 2013 Spätzlerstreit controversies,[89] which identified gentrification with newcomers from the German south.

Zoning ordinances and other urban planning tools can be used to recognize and support local business and industries. This can include requiring developers to continue with a current commercial tenant or offering development incentives for keeping existing businesses, as well as creating and maintaining industrial zones. Designing zoning to allow new housing near to a commercial corridor but not on top of it increases foot traffic to local businesses without redeveloping them. Businesses can become more stable by securing long-term commercial leases.[90]

Although developers may recognize value in responding to living patterns, extensive zoning policies often prevent affordable homes from being constructed within urban development. Due to urban density restrictions, rezoning for residential development within urban living areas is difficult, which forces the builder and the market into urban sprawl and propagates the energy inefficiencies that come with distance from urban centers. In a recent example of restrictive urban zoning requirements, Arcadia Development Co. was prevented from rezoning a parcel for residential development in an urban setting within the city of Morgan Hill, California. With limitations established in the interest of public welfare, a density restriction was applied solely to Arcadia Development Co.'s parcel of development, excluding any planned residential expansion.[91]

Because land speculation tends to cause volatility in property values, removing real estate (houses, buildings, land) from the open market freezes property values, and thereby prevents the economic eviction of the community's poorer residents. The most common, formal legal mechanism for such stability in English speaking countries is the community land trust; moreover, many inclusionary zoning ordinances formally place the ""inclusionary"" housing units in a land trust. German municipalities and other cooperative actors have and maintain strong roles on the real estate markets in their realm.

In jurisdictions where local or national government has these powers, there may be rent control regulations. Rent control restricts the rent that can be charged, so that incumbent tenants are not forced out by rising rents. If applicable to private landlords, it is a disincentive to speculating with property values, reduces the incidence of dwellings left empty, and limits availability of housing for new residents. If the law does not restrict the rent charged for dwellings that come onto the rental market (formerly owner-occupied or new build), rents in an area can still increase. Neighborhoods in southwestern Santa Monica and eastern West Hollywood in California, United States gentrified despite—or perhaps, because of—rent control.[92]

Occasionally, a housing black market develops, wherein landlords withdraw houses and apartments from the market, making them available only upon payment of additional key money, fees, or bribes—thus undermining the rent control law. Many such laws allow ""vacancy decontrol"", releasing a dwelling from rent control upon the tenant's leaving—resulting in steady losses of rent-controlled housing, ultimately rendering rent control laws ineffective in communities with a high rate of resident turnover. In other cases social housing owned by local authorities may be sold to tenants and then sold on. Vacancy decontrol encourages landlords to find ways of shortening their residents' tenure, most aggressively through landlord harassment. To strengthen the rent control laws of New York, housing advocates active in rent control in New York are attempting to repeal the vacancy decontrol clauses of rent control laws. The state of Massachusetts abolished rent control in 1994; afterwards, rents rose, accelerating the pace of Boston's gentrification; however, the laws protected few apartments, and confounding factors, such as a strong economy, had already been raising housing and rental prices.[93]

London is being ""made over"" by an urban centred middle class. In the post war era, upwardly mobile social classes tended to leave the city. Now, led by a new middle class, they are reconstructing much of inner London as a place both in which to work and live.
Gentrification is not a new phenomenon in Britain; in ancient Rome the shop-free forum was developed during the Roman Republican period, and in 2nd- and 3rd-century cities in Roman Britain there is evidence of small shops being replaced by large villas.[6]

King's College London academic Loretta Lees reported that much of Inner London was undergoing ""super-gentrification"", where ""a new group of super-wealthy professionals, working in the City of London [i.e. the financial industry], is slowly imposing its mark on this Inner London housing market, in a way that differentiates it, and them, from traditional gentrifiers, and from the traditional urban upper classes ... Super-gentrification is quite different from the classical version of gentrification. It's of a higher economic order; you need a much higher salary and bonuses to live in Barnsbury"" (some two miles north of central London).[95] Rising housing prices due to gentrification within London have led to a doubling of evictions done by private landlords and to a long-term decline in home ownership from the years 2003–2020.[96]

Barnsbury was built around 1820, as a middle-class neighbourhood, but after the Second World War (1939–1945), many people moved to the suburbs. The upper and middle classes were fleeing from the working class residents of London, made possible by the modern railway. At the war's end, the great housing demand rendered Barnsbury a place of cheap housing, where most people shared accommodation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, people moving into the area had to finance house renovations with their money, because banks rarely financed loans for Barnsbury. Moreover, the rehabilitating spark was The 1959 Housing Purchase and Housing Act, investing £100 million to rehabilitating old properties and infrastructure. As a result, the principal population influx occurred between 1961 and 1975; the UK Census reports that ""between the years of 1961 and 1981, owner-occupation increased from 7 to 19 per cent, furnished rentals declined from 14 to 7 per cent, and unfurnished rentals declined from 61 to 6 per cent"";[97] another example of urban gentrification is the super-gentrification, in the 1990s, of the neighboring working-class London Borough of Islington, where Prime Minister Tony Blair lived until his election in 1997.[95] The conversion of older houses into flats emerged in the 1980s as developers saw the profits to be made. By the end of the 1980s, conversions were the single largest source of new dwellings in London.[98]

Mexico City has been an iconic example of an extensive metropolitan area since the 14th century when it became the largest city in the American continent. Its continuous population growth and concentration of economic and political power boomed in the 1930s when the country's involvement with global markets benefited the national financial industry. Currently the fifth largest city in the world, with a population of 21 million inhabitants (17.47% of national population) living in 16 districts and 59 municipalities, the urban area continues to expand receiving 1,100 new residents daily. The division of the city is derived from a strong socially and economically segregated population connected by its interdependence, that manifests into spatial arrangements where luxury areas coexist alongside slums. Its development around a core called ""El Zocalo"" derives from the historic, cultural and political relevance of a central plaza, as well as its contemporary concentration of economic power, currently housing 80% of all national firms.[99][100][101]

In recent years, there has been a large uptick in new development in Mexico City, funded by state and private investments.[99] These urban developments have been catered to elite communities mainly because this group economically supports the country (38% of the total national income is produced by the top 10%) and because the government, predominantly led by PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional), has maintained a profit-oriented policy perspective. Thus, these developments have not only led to an increase of population, traffic and pollution due to inefficient urban planning, but have also pushed great amounts of low-income families to the edges of the city and have challenged the safety of the 11.5 million people that economically depend on the underground sector.[102] This issue adds to the already critical condition of 40% of the population living in informal settlements, often without access to sewage network and clean water. The geology of the city, located in a mountain valley, further contributes to unhealthy living conditions, concentrating high levels of air pollution.[103]

The reality currently faced by the city is that of a historic rapid urban growth that has been unable to be adequately controlled and planned for, because of a corrupted and economically driven government, as well as a complex society that is strongly segregated. The negative effects of gentrification in Mexico City have been overlooked by the authorities, regarded as an inevitable process and argued to be in some cases nonexistent.[101]  In recent years, however, an array of proposals have been developed as a way to continue the gentrification of the city in a way that integrates and respects the rights of all citizens.

By the 1970s, investors in Toronto started buying up city houses—turning them into temporary rooming houses to make rental income until the desired price in the housing market for selling off the properties was reached (so that the rooming houses could be replaced with high income-oriented new housing)—a gentrification process called ""blockbusting"".[104]

As of 2011[update], gentrification in Canada has proceeded quickly in older and denser cities such as Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton and Vancouver, but has barely begun in places such as Calgary, Edmonton, or Winnipeg, where suburban expansion is still the primary type of growth.

Canada's unique history and official multiculturalism policy has resulted in a different strain of gentrification than that of the United States. Some gentrification in Toronto has been sparked by the efforts of business improvement associations to market the ethnic communities in which they operate, such as in Corso Italia and Greektown.[105]

In Quebec City, the Saint Roch neighbourhood in the city's lower town was previously predominantly working class and had gone through a period of decline. However, since the early to mid 2000s, the area has seen the transformation of the derelict buildings into condos and the opening of bars, restaurants and cafes, attracting young professionals into the area, but kicking out the residents from many generations back. Several software developers and gaming companies, such as Ubisoft and Beenox, have also opened offices there.

In Paris, most poor neighborhoods in the east have seen rising prices and the arrival of many wealthy residents. However, the process is mitigated by social housing and most cities tend to favor a ""social mix""; that is, having both low and high-income residents in the same neighborhoods. But in practice, social housing does not cater to the poorest segment of the population; most residents of social dwellings are from the low-end of the middle class. As a result, a lot of poor people have been forced to go first to the close suburbs (1970 to 2000) and then more and more to remote ""periurban areas"" where public transport is almost nonexistent. The close suburbs (Saint-Ouen, Saint Denis, Aubervilliers, ...) are now in the early stages of gentrification although still poor. A lot of high-profile companies offering well-paid jobs have moved near Saint-Denis and new real-estate programs are underway to provide living areas close to the new jobs.

On the other side, the eviction of the poorest people to periurban areas since 2000 has been analyzed as the main cause for the rising political far-right National Front. When the poor lived in the close suburbs, their problems were very visible to the wealthy population. But the periurban population and its problem is mainly ""invisible"" from recent[when?] presidential campaign promises. These people have labelled themselves ""les invisibles"". Many of them fled both rising costs in Paris and nearby suburbs with an insecure and ugly environment to live in small houses in the countryside but close to the city. But they did not factor in the huge financial and human cost of having up to four hours of transportation every day. Since then, a lot has been invested in the close suburbs (with new public transports set to open and urban renewal programs) they fled, but almost nobody cares of these ""invisible"" plots of land. Since the close suburbs are now mostly inhabited by immigrants, these people have a strong resentment against immigration: They feel everything is done for new immigrants but nothing for the native French population.[106]

This has been first documented in the book Plaidoyer pour une gauche populaire by think-tank Terra-Nova which had a major influence on all contestants in the presidential election (and at least, Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Marine Le Pen). This electorate voted overwhelmingly in favor of Marine Le Pen and Sarkozy while the city centers and close suburbs voted overwhelmingly for François Hollande.

Most major metropolises in France follow the same pattern with a belt of periurban development about 30 to 80 kilometers of the center where a lot of poor people moved in and are now trapped by rising fuel costs. These communities have been disrupted by the arrival of new people and already suffered of high unemployment due to the dwindling numbers of industrial jobs.

In smaller cities, the suburbs are still the principal place where people live and the center is more and more akin to a commercial estate where a lot of commercial activities take place but where few people live.

Generally in Honduras the phenomenon of gentrification had not been so widespread because it had been a nation with a less developed economy than other countries in the Latin American region, however this phenomenon has begun to grow exponentially in the last decade.  The main areas where the increase has been seen are the urban centers of its two most important cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.[107] In the last years Honduras has become an emerging destination for digital nomads, these travelers are often attracted by the tropical climate, natural beauty, low cost of living compared to their home countries, and the ability to work remotely from attractive locations.

Some of the places that have suffered this phenomenon are the Bay islands, Valle de Angeles, Santa Lucia, and Copan Ruinas. The main reasons for this phenomenon in Honduras are real estate companies, foreign investors, real estate agencies, expatriates, and retirees. The case of the Bay Islands has been special due to the purchase of land mainly by high-income residents, hotel companies, and foreigners. Making the cost of housing for islanders more expensive and the cost of living has increased extensively, several fishing communities have denounced the increase in the cost of living in historically inhabited communities inhabited by them for generations. This phenomenon has even been seen in how more foreign currencies are used in the area, such as the dollar, which is the most used on the islands.[108]

As for the urban centers of the country, Teguciglapa has seen the rehabilitation of old wealthy buildings in the historic center for the so-called Digital Nomads. The construction of nerw condominiums has also accelerated this phenomenon in the city as they are centers with an expensive level of rental. As for San Pedro Sula, this phenomenon is seen more in the Los Andes neighborhood has been accommodated for this kind of travelers.[109]

Gentrification in South Africa has been categorized into two waves for two different periods of time. Visser and Kotze find that the first wave occurred in the 1980s to the Post-Apartheid period, the second wave occurred during and after the 2000s.[110] Both of these trends of gentrification has been analyzed and reviewed by scholars in different lenses. One view which Atkinson uses is that gentrification is purely the reflection of middle-class values on to a working-class neighborhood.[111] The second view is the wider view is suggested by Visser and Kotze which views gentrification with inclusions of rural locations, infill housing, and luxury residency development.[110] While Kotze and Visser find that gentrification has been under a provocative lens by media all over the world, South Africa's gentrification process was harder to identify because of the need to differentiate between gentrification and the change of conditions from the Apartheid.[112]

Furthermore, the authors note that the pre-conditions for gentrification where events like tertiary decentralization (suburbanization of the service industry) and capital flight (disinvestment) were occurring, which caused scholars to ignore the subject of gentrification due to the normality of the process.[112] Additionally, Kotze and Visser found that as state-run programs and private redevelopment programs began to focus on the pursuit of ""global competitiveness"" and well-rounded prosperity, it hid the underlying foundations of gentrification under the guise of redevelopment.[113] As a result, the effect is similar to what Teppo and Millstein coins as the pursuit to moralize the narrative to legitimize the benefit to all people.[114] This concurrently created an effect where Visser and Kotze conclude that the perceived gentrification was only the fact that the target market was people commonly associated with gentrification.[115] As Visser and Kotze states, ""It appears as if apartheid red-lining on racial grounds has been replaced by a financially exclusive property market that entrenches prosperity and privilege.""[116]

Generally, Atkinson observes that when looking at scholarly discourse for the gentrification and rapid urbanization of South Africa, the main focus is not on the smaller towns of South Africa. This is a large issue because small towns are magnets for poorer people and repellants for skilled people.[117] In one study, Atkinson dives into research in a small town, Aberdeen in the East Cape. Also as previously mentioned, Atkinson finds that this area has shown signs of gentrification. This is due to redevelopment which indicates clearly the reflection of middle-class values.[111] In this urbanization of the area, Atkinson finds that there is clear dependence on state-programs which leads to further development and growth of the area, this multiplier of the economy would present a benefit of gentrification.[118] The author then attributes the positive growth with the benefits in gentrification by examining the increase in housing opportunities.[119]

Then, by surveying the recent newcomers to the area, Atkinson's research found that there is confidence for local economic growth which further indicated shifts to middle-class values, therefore, gentrification.[120] This research also demonstrated growth in ""modernizers"" which demonstrate the general belief of gentrification where there is value for architectural heritage as well as urban development.[121] Lastly, Atkinson's study found that the gentrification effects of growth can be accredited to the increase in unique or scarce skills to the municipality which revived interest in the growth of the local area. This gentrification of the area would then negative impact the poorer demographics where the increase in housing would displace and exclude them from receiving benefits. In conclusion, after studying the small town of Aberdeen, Atkinson finds that ""Paradoxically, it is possible that gentrification could promote economic growth and employment while simultaneously increasing class inequality.""[121]

Historically, Garside notes that due to the Apartheid, the inner cities of Cape Town was cleared of non-white communities. But because of the Group Areas Act, some certain locations were controlled for such communities. Specifically, Woodstock has been a racially mixed community with a compilation of European settlers (such as the Afrikaners and the 1820 Settlers), Eastern European Jews, immigrants from Angola and Mozambique, and the coloured Capetonians. For generations, these groups lived in this area characterizing it be a working-class neighborhood.[122] But as the times changed and restrictions were relaxed, Teppo and Millstein observes that the community became more and more ""gray"" as in a combination between white and mixed communities.[123]

Then this progression continues to which Garside finds that an exaggeration as more middle-income groups moved into the area. This emigration resulted in a distinct split between Upper Woodstock and Lower Woodstock. Coupled with the emergence of a strong middle-class in South Africa, Woodstock became a destination for convenience and growth. While Upper Woodstock was a predominantly white area, Lower Woodstock then received the attention of the mixed middle-income community. This increase in demand for housing gave landlords incentives to raise prices to profit off of the growing wealth in the area. The 400-500% surge in the housing market for Woodstock thus displaced and excluded the working-class and retired who previously resided in the community.[124] Furthermore, Garside states that the progression of gentrification was accentuated by the fact that most of the previous residents would only be renting their living space.[125] Both Teppo and Millstein would find that this displacement of large swaths of communities would increase demand in other areas of Woodstock or inner city slums.[126]

The Bo-Kaap pocket of Cape Town nestles against the slopes of Signal Hill. It has traditionally been occupied by members of South Africa's minority, mainly Muslim, Cape Malay community. These descendants of artisans and political captives, brought to the Cape as early as the 18th century as slaves and indentured workers, were housed in small barrack-like abodes on what used to be the outskirts of town. As the city limits increased, property in the Bo-Kaap became very sought after, not only for its location but also for its picturesque cobble-streets and narrow avenues. Increasingly, this close-knit community is ""facing a slow dissolution of its distinctive character as wealthy outsiders move into the suburb to snap up homes in the City Bowl at cut-rate prices"".[127]  Inter-community conflict has also arisen as some residents object to the sale of buildings and the resultant eviction of long-term residents.

In another specific case, Millstein and Teppo discovered that working-class residents would become embattled with their landlords. On Gympie Street, which has been labeled as the most dangerous street in Cape Town, it was home to many of the working-class. But as gentrification occurred, landlords brought along tactics to evict low-paying tenants through non-payment clauses. One landlord who bought a building cheaply from an auction, immediately raised the rental price which would then proceed to court for evictions. But, the tenants were able to group together to make a strong case to win. Regardless of the outcome, the landlord resorted to turning off both power and water in the building. The tenants then were exhausted out of motivation to fight. One tenant described it as similar to living in a shack which would be the future living space one displaced.[128] Closing, the Teppo and Millstein's research established that gentrification's progress for urban development would coincide with a large displacement of the poorer communities which also excluded them from any benefits to gentrification. The authors state, ""The end results are the same in both cases: in the aftermath of the South African negotiated revolution, the elite colonize the urban areas from those who are less privileged, claiming the city for themselves.""[129]

In Italy, similarly to other countries around the world, the phenomenon of gentrification is proceeding in the largest cities, such as Milan, Turin, Genoa and Rome.[130][131]

In Milan, gentrification is changing the look of some semi-central neighborhoods, just outside the inner ring road (called ""Cerchia dei Bastioni""), particularly of former working class and industrial areas.
One of the most well known cases is the neighborhood of Isola. Despite its position, this area has been for a long time considered as a suburb since it has been an isolated part of the city, due to the physical barriers such as the railways and the Naviglio Martesana. In the 1950s, a new business district was built not far from this area, but Isola remained a distant and low-class area. In the 2000s vigorous efforts to make Isola as a symbolic place of the Milan of the future were carried out and, with this aim, the Porta Garibaldi-Isola districts became attractors for stylists and artists.[131][132] Moreover, in the second half of the same decade, a massive urban rebranding project, known as Progetto Porta Nuova, started and the neighbourhood of Isola, despite the compliances residents have had,[133] has been one of the regenerated areas, with the Bosco Verticale and the new Giardini di Porta Nuova.

Another semi-central district that has undergone this phenomenon in Milan is Zona Tortona. Former industrial area situated behind Porta Genova station, Zona Tortona is nowadays the Mecca of Italian design and annually hosts some of the most important events of the Milan Design Week during which more than 150 expositors, such as Superstudio, take part.[134] In Zona Tortona, some of important landmarks, related to culture, design and arts, are located such as Fondazione Pomodoro, the Armani/Silos, Spazio A and MUDEC.

Going towards the outskirts of the city, other gentrified areas of Milan are Lambrate-Ventura (where others events of the Milan Design Week are hosted),[135] Bicocca and Bovisa (in which universities have contributed to the gentrification of the areas), Sesto San Giovanni, Via Sammartini, and the so-called NoLo district (which means ""Nord di Loreto"").[136]

In Poland, gentrification is proceeding mostly in the big cities like Warsaw, Łódź, Kraków, Metropolis GZM, Poznań, and Wrocław. The reason of this is both de-industrialisation and poor condition of some residential areas.

The biggest European ongoing gentrification process has been occurring in Łódź from the beginning of the 2010s. Huge unemployment (24% in the 1990s) caused by the downfall of the garment industry created both economic and social problems. Moreover, vast majority of industrial and housing facilities had been constructed in the late 19th century and the renovation was neglected after World War II. Łódź authorities rebuilt the industrial district into the New City Center. This included re-purposing buildings including the former electrical power and heating station into the Łódź Fabryczna railway station and the EC1 Science Museum.

There are other significant gentrifications in Poland, such as:

Nowadays the Polish government has started National Revitalization Plan[139] which ensures financial support to municipal gentrification programs.

Central Moscow rapidly gentrified following the change from the communist central-planning policies of the Soviet era to the market economy of the post-Soviet Russian government.[140]

From a market standpoint, there are two main requirements that are met by the U.S. cities that undergo substantial effects of gentrification. These are: an excess supply of deteriorated housing in central areas, as well as a considerable growth in the availability of professional jobs located in central business districts. These conditions have been met in the U.S. largely as a result of suburbanization and other postindustrial phenomena. There have been three chronological waves of gentrification in the U.S. starting from the 1960s.[44]

The first wave came in the 1960s and early 1970s, led by governments trying to reduce the disinvestment that was taking place in inner-city urban areas.[44] Additionally, starting in the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. industry has created a surplus of housing units as construction of new homes has far surpassed the rate of national household growth. However, the market forces that are dictated by an excess supply cannot fully explain the geographical specificity of gentrification in the U.S., for there are many large cities that meet this requirement and have not exhibited gentrification.

The missing link is another factor that can be explained by particular, necessary demand forces. In U.S. cities in the time period from 1970 to 1978, growth of the central business district at around 20% did not dictate conditions for gentrification, while growth at or above 33% yielded appreciably larger gentrification activity.[26] Central business district growth will activate gentrification in the presence of a surplus in the inner city housing market. The 1970s brought the more ""widespread"" second wave of gentrification, and was sometimes linked to the development of artist communities like SoHo in New York.[44]

In the U.S., the conditions for gentrification were generated by the economic transition from manufacturing to post-industrial service economies. The post-World War II economy experienced a service revolution, which created white-collar jobs and larger opportunities for women in the work force, as well as an expansion in the importance of centralized administrative and cooperate activities. This increased the demand for inner city residences, which were readily available cheaply after much of the movement towards central city abandonment of the 1950s. The coupling of these movements is what became the trigger for the expansive gentrification of U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.[26]

The third wave of gentrification occurred in most major cities in the late 1990s and was driven by large-scale developments, public-private partnerships, and government policies.[141] Measurement of the rate of gentrification during the period from 1990 to 2010 in 50 U.S. cities showed an increase in the rate of gentrification from 9% in the decade of the 1990s to 20% in the decade from 2000 to 2010 with 8% of the urban neighborhoods in the 50 cities being affected.

Cities with a rate of gentrification of ≈40% or more in the decade from 2000 to 2010 included:[142]

Cities with a rate of less than 10% in the decade from 2000 to 2010 included:[142]

Society Hill, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Philadelphia, PA, was designated for urban renewal in the late 1950s. This urban renewal called for renovations of buildings that were home to families of color. While it was initially promised that the families would not have to leave by the OHA (Octavia Hill Association), they were later evicted and it was determined that it would not be possible to renovate these buildings while keeping the price of rent low. An African American woman named Dorothy Miller (née Stroud) became the face of the Octavia Hill Seven, a moniker given to the seven households who resisted the relocation. Philip Price Jr. was a lawyer who joined Miller in the fight for affordable housing. With his leadership, several residents formed an SHCA committee and subsequently a nonprofit organization to consider options for rehabilitation or new construction for Miller and her neighbors. They named their organization Benezet Court, Inc., after an early abolitionist in Philadelphia. Eventually, the organization was able to achieve affordable housing options in the neighborhood.[143]

The Movement for Justice in El Barrio is an immigrant-led, organized group of tenants who resist against gentrification in East Harlem, New York. This movement has 954 members and 95 building communities.[144] On 8 April 2006, the MJB gathered people to protest in the New York City Hall against an investment bank in the United Kingdom that purchased 47 buildings and 1,137 homes in East Harlem. News of these protests reached England, Scotland, France and Spain. MJB made a call to action that everyone, internationally, should fight against gentrification. This movement gained international traction and also became known as the International Campaign Against Gentrification in El Barrio.[145]

On 26 September 2015, a cereal cafe in East London called Cereal Killer Cafe was attacked by a large group of anti-gentrification protestors. These protestors carried with them a pig's head and torches, stating that they were tired of unaffordable luxury flats going into their neighborhoods. These protestors were alleged to be primarily ""middle-class academics"", who were upset by the lack of community and culture that they once saw in East London.[146][147] People targeted Cereal Killer Cafe during their protest because of an alleged article in which one of the brothers with ownership of the cafe had said marking up prices was necessary as a business in the area. After the attack on the cafe, users on Twitter were upset that protestors had targeted a small business as the focus of their demonstration, as opposed to a larger one.[148]

The San Francisco tech bus protests occurred in late 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, protesting against tech shuttle buses that take employees to and from their homes in the Bay Area to workplaces in Silicon Valley. Protestors said the buses were symbolic of the gentrification occurring in the city, rising rent prices, and the displacement of small businesses. This protest gained global attention and also inspired anti-gentrification movements in East London.[149]

On 22 November 2017, ink! Coffee, a small coffee shop, placed a manufactured metal Sandwich board sign on the sidewalk outside one of their Denver locations in the historic Five Points, Denver neighborhood.  The sign said ""Happily gentrifying the neighborhood since 2014"" on one side and ""Nothing says gentrification like being able to order a cortado"" on the other side.[150]

Ink's ad ignited outrage and garnered national attention when a picture of the sign was shared on social media by a prominent Denver writer, Ru Johnson.  The picture of the sign quickly went viral accumulating critical comments and negative reviews. Ink! responded to the social media outrage with a public apology followed by a lengthier apology from its founder, Keith Herbert.  Ink's public apology deemed the sign a bad joke causing even more outrage on social media.[150] The ad design was created by a Five Points, Denver firm named Cultivator Advertising & Design.  The advertising firm responded to the public's dismay by issuing an ill-received social media apology, ""An Open Letter to Our Neighbors"".[151]

The night following the debut of ink's controversial ad campaign their Five Points, Denver location was vandalized.  A window was broken and the words ""WHITE COFFEE"" among others were spray-painted onto the front of the building.  Protest organizers gathered at the coffee shop daily following the controversy.  The coffee shop was closed for business the entire holiday weekend following the scandal.[151]

At least 200 people attended a protest and boycott event on 25 November 2017 outside of ink!'s Five Points location.[152]  News of the controversy was covered by media outlets worldwide.[153][154][155][156]

On 3 March 2018, an anarchist group vandalized coffee shops, luxury automobiles, and restaurants on Locke Street in Hamilton, Ontario.[157] The attack was linked to an anarchist group in the city known as The Tower, that aimed to highlight issues of gentrification in Hamilton through vandalizing new businesses.[158] On 7 March, The Tower's free community library was vandalized by what the group referred to as ""far-right goons"".[159] Investigation followed, with arrests related to the Locke Street vandalism being made by Hamilton police in April and June 2018.[160]

Hwang discovers factors that can cause neighborhood changes: Households might be more attracted to a neighborhood because of (1) increases in access value, (2) increases in amenity value, or (3) decline in housing prices relative to other neighborhoods. These factors attract investors and eventually leads to gentrification.[161]

Gentrification can promote neighborhood revitalization and desegregation. Because of this, a gentrification-as-integration model has been supported to stop population loss, and to rebuild low-income neighborhoods.[162]

Gentrification has been called the savior of cities from urban crisis because it has led to urban revitalization, which promotes the economy of struggling cities.[163]

The Fair Housing Act can be used as litigation against gentrification because the urban development process of higher-income individuals into lower-income neighborhoods leads to displacement.[164]

socio-economic impacts. Gentrification involves the transformation of neighborhoods through an influx of affluent residents and investments, often leading to increased property values but also potential displacement of lower-income residents. The term lacks a universally accepted definition and carries political and social connotations. Historical instances date back to ancient Rome, with modern usage popularized by sociologist Ruth Glass in 1964. Various definitions emphasize different aspects, such as economic revitalization or displacement effects. Studies show mixed evidence on whether gentrification leads to displacement or benefits existing residents through improved infrastructure and reduced crime rates. Economic impacts include increased local tax bases and job creation, though benefits are unevenly distributed between homeowners and renters. Socially, gentrification can lead to both community cohesion and conflict due to differing norms among new and existing residents. Health impacts are also mixed, with some studies indicating adverse effects for vulnerable populations. Strategies to mitigate negative effects include inclusionary zoning and community land trusts, though their effectiveness varies by region.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants, setting the tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick check-in on how everyone is doing\n- Brief overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes"", ""Scene 2: Introduction to Gentrification Topic\nTLDR: Introduce the topic of gentrification, its historical context, and socio-economic impacts.\n- Urban Planner provides a brief history of gentrification\n- Sociologist discusses social impacts and community changes\n- Economist highlights economic trends and impacts"", ""Scene 3: Historical Context Discussion\nTLDR: Delve into the historical instances of gentrification and their relevance today.\n- Historian shares examples from ancient Rome to modern times\n- Participants discuss similarities and differences across eras\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions on historical perspectives"", ""Scene 4: Economic Impacts Analysis\nTLDR: Analyze the economic effects of gentrification on local communities.\n- Economist presents data on property values, tax bases, job creation\n- Discussion on uneven distribution of benefits between homeowners and renters\n- Participants share personal experiences related to economic changes in their areas"", ""Scene 5: Social Impacts Exploration\nTLDR: Explore the social consequences of gentrification, including community cohesion and conflict.\n- Sociologist explains mixed evidence on displacement vs. benefits for existing residents\n- Community Activist shares stories from affected neighborhoods\n- Open discussion on strategies to balance revitalization with community needs"", ""Scene 6: Health Impacts Consideration\nTLDR: Discuss health implications of gentrification for vulnerable populations.\n- Urban Planner presents studies indicating adverse health effects vs. improved infrastructure benefits\n- Participants debate potential solutions to mitigate negative health impacts"", ""Scene 7: Mitigation Strategies Discussion\nTLDR: Evaluate strategies to mitigate negative effects of gentrification.\n- Community Activist introduces inclusionary zoning and community land trusts as potential solutions\n- Participants discuss effectiveness of these strategies in different regions\n- Spontaneous contributions on other innovative approaches"", ""Scene 8: Coordination of Tasks and Projects Virtually \nTLDR: Plan collaborative efforts to address issues discussed during the meeting.\n - Assign roles for follow-up tasks \n - Set deadlines for project milestones \n - Discuss tools for virtual collaboration (e.g., shared documents, regular check-ins)"", ""Scene 9: Open Floor for Unplanned Topics \n TLDR : Allow participants to bring up any additional points or concerns not covered in previous scenes. \n - Encourage sharing personal experiences related to urban development \n - Address any emerging topics or questions from participants"", ""Scene 10 : Closing Remarks \\ n TLDR : Summarize key takeaways from the meeting , outline next steps .\\ n - Each participant shares one key takeaway or action item .\\ n - Confirm deadlines , next meeting date .\\ n - Thank everyone for their participation , close the meeting .""]",">>Urban Planner: Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. Let's dive into our main objectives for today: discussing sustainable urban development strategies and addressing community needs.
>>Sociologist: Morning! Great to see you all. Let's get started.
>>Economist: Morning! I'm good, thanks. We should focus on how our strategies impact the local economy.
>>Community Activist: Hey, good morning. I think it's crucial we focus on the community's needs today and ensure our strategies truly benefit them.
>>Historian: Good morning, everyone. It's important that our strategies respect historical contexts while promoting sustainable growth. 
 >>Urban Planner: Thanks, Historian. Gentrification has been around for a long time. Even in ancient cities, we saw wealthier people moving into poorer areas and changing them. This shows that gentrification is a recurring part of urban development.

>>Sociologist: Right, but the problem is that gentrification often disrupts communities. It can bring economic benefits and reduce crime, but it also displaces long-term residents and changes the community's identity. We need to think about how these social structures are affected.

>>Economist: Exactly. When neighborhoods gentrify, property values can go up by 20-30% in just a few years. But we have to make sure this growth doesn't push out the people who have lived there for a long time.

>>Community Activist: It's not just about numbers and growth. We need to listen to the people who live here. Gentrification often means they lose their homes and their sense of community.

>>Urban Planner: Absolutely. We need to find ways to grow sustainably without displacing residents. How can we include affordable housing and policies that focus on the community?

>>Sociologist: Yes, when people are displaced, it's not just about losing their homes; it's about losing their support networks and cultural heritage too. How do we keep these social bonds intact while improving the neighborhood?

>>Economist: We should look at policies like inclusionary zoning, which requires developers to include affordable housing in new projects. This way, everyone can benefit from neighborhood improvements.

>>Community Activist: Policies are important, but let's not forget the human side of this issue. When long-term residents are forced out, they lose more than just their homes—they lose their community and identity too.

>>Historian: Gentrification has always been part of city life, but we need to learn from past mistakes. If we're not careful, we'll end up erasing entire communities in the name of progress.

>>Urban Planner: Exactly! To prevent displacement, we need policies that prioritize affordable housing and community-focused development strategies like inclusionary zoning.

>>Sociologist: The social fabric is crucial here—displacement isn't just about losing homes; it's about losing community networks and cultural heritage too! How do we ensure these vital elements remain intact while pursuing economic growth?

>>Economist: Data shows that controlled gentrification can boost local economies—but only if inclusive policies like inclusionary zoning exist—to keep housing affordable for all income levels—ensuring everyone benefits from neighborhood improvements—not just newcomers! 
 >>Historian: History shows us that gentrification can have both good and bad effects. Take ancient Rome, for instance—by the 3rd century AD, small shops were replaced by large villas, leading to significant social displacement. We need to learn from these past mistakes and make sure our urban development strategies are not only economically viable but also socially inclusive.

>>Sociologist: That's a great point about ancient Rome. I'm curious, how did the local communities respond to those changes back then? And what can we do today to avoid similar issues?

>>Community Activist: It's not just about learning from the past; we need to actively involve the community in these decisions. If we don't ensure every voice is heard in urban development, we'll keep making the same mistakes.

>>Urban Planner: Absolutely. Sustainable growth is key. We must incorporate green spaces and affordable housing to prevent displacement while promoting economic vitality. How can we integrate these elements effectively?

>>Economist: Data shows that integrating green spaces and affordable housing can significantly boost local economies. For example, new large apartment buildings in low-income neighborhoods often lead to an influx of high-income households while decreasing rents in nearby units by increasing housing supply. What do you all think about applying this here?

>>Sociologist: That's interesting about the economic benefits. But how do we ensure these developments don't inadvertently lead to further displacement? What measures can protect existing communities?

>>Urban Planner: To prevent further displacement, we need policies like inclusionary zoning and community land trusts. Inclusionary zoning means developers must include affordable units in new projects—let's discuss this more if anyone needs details.

>>Community Activist: Can you clarify what inclusionary zoning entails exactly? I think some people might not be familiar with it.

>>Urban Planner: Sure! It requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable units within new residential projects, creating mixed-income communities and ensuring long-term affordability.

>>Sociologist: The social fabric is crucial here. When integrating green spaces and affordable housing, it's essential to consider how these changes impact existing community networks. How can we preserve cultural heritage and social bonds while promoting sustainable growth?

>>Urban Planner: Good point! Mixed-use developments could help by integrating residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within the same area, creating vibrant communities that cater to diverse needs while promoting economic growth. But how do we ensure these developments remain accessible to all income levels?

>>Economist: To keep them accessible... 
 >>Urban Planner: You know, the data on property values and tax bases is quite revealing. But we must also consider how these economic shifts impact long-term residents. For instance, in my own neighborhood, we've seen a significant rise in property taxes that has forced many long-time renters to relocate.

>>Sociologist: Well, the impact on social structures is profound. In my research, I've observed that when long-term residents are displaced, it disrupts the social fabric of the community. This displacement often leads to a loss of community resilience and support networks that have been built over decades.

>>Economist: The data shows that property values in gentrifying neighborhoods can increase by up to 20% annually, which significantly boosts the local tax base. However, this economic growth often benefits homeowners more than renters. For instance, in a recent study of a gentrified area, homeowners saw their property values double within five years, while renters faced a 30% increase in rent prices.

>>Community Activist: I mean, it's not just about the numbers. I've seen families in my neighborhood who've lived there for generations being pushed out because they can't afford the rising rents. We need policies that protect long-term renters from sudden rent hikes and ensure every voice matters in these decisions.

>>Historian: History shows us that gentrification often transforms neighborhoods significantly. Take early 20th century Harlem, for instance. The influx of affluent African Americans led to a cultural renaissance but also displaced many long-term residents.

>>Urban Planner: That's an important point about Harlem's history. In my neighborhood too, new development projects have led to surges in property values—great for homeowners but devastating for renters who couldn't keep up with rising costs. How can we ensure such growth benefits everyone?

>>Sociologist: Exactly! And as you mentioned earlier about your neighborhood's experience with rising taxes forcing relocations—this isn't just an economic issue; it's deeply social too. When people are uprooted from their communities, they lose vital support networks which can have lasting negative effects on well-being.

>>Economist: Building on what both of you said—while property values can increase by up to 20% annually; benefits aren't evenly distributed among all residents. Homeowners see significant gains but renters face steep rent hikes leading to displacement. We need comprehensive policies ensuring economic stability for all residents like rent control measures or affordable housing initiatives.

>>Community Activist: It's heartbreaking seeing families who've been here for generations being pushed out like this! We had a community garden bringing everyone together but now it's just another high-rise... We need to prioritize our community's needs over unchecked development and create safeguards against such rapid changes.

>>Historian: Absolutely! And looking at more recent examples like San Francisco during its tech boom—we saw similar patterns where longtime residents were priced out due to skyrocketing rents driven by demand from high-income newcomers... 
 >>Sociologist: Well, gentrification can bring some economic benefits and reduce crime rates in the short term, but it often disrupts communities. Long-term residents get displaced, which can really hurt community resilience and support networks.

>>Urban Planner: How do we make sure new developments include provisions for long-term residents without pushing them out? Sustainable growth is key, but we need to balance it with what the community needs. What strategies have worked in other cities?

>>Community Activist: You know, it's not just about the numbers or the economic benefits. I've seen firsthand how gentrification tears apart communities. Families who've lived here for generations are being pushed out because they can't afford rising rents. We need policies that protect these residents and prioritize affordable housing.

>>Economist: Economic stability is crucial, but we also need to consider the financial strain on long-term residents. Cities with inclusionary zoning policies have lower displacement rates—how can we adapt these policies here?

>>Historian: Looking back at historical examples like New York's Lower East Side in the 1980s, we see that gentrification often leads to the erasure of cultural landmarks and local businesses. How do we ensure our modern developments preserve these vital elements of community identity?

>>Urban Planner: We need to look at successful examples from other cities. For instance, in Portland, they've implemented policies requiring developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new projects. This approach helps maintain the social fabric and ensures sustainable growth by integrating diverse income groups within the same community.

>>Sociologist: It's important to recognize that gentrification doesn't just affect housing; it can also lead to the displacement of local businesses and cultural institutions which are integral parts of a community's identity. How do we ensure these elements are preserved while promoting economic development?

>>Community Activist: Exactly! And you know what? It's not just about preserving buildings or businesses; it's about preserving people's lives and their sense of belonging. We need more than just token efforts—we need real commitment from policymakers.

>>Economist: Um... I agree with you there. Policies like rent control and affordable housing mandates can help mitigate some negative impacts. But we also need incentives for developers to invest in these areas without displacing current residents.

>>Historian: Well said! If history has taught us anything, it's that unchecked development often leads to significant social upheaval. We should learn from past mistakes and strive for a more inclusive approach this time around.

>>Urban Planner: Absolutely! And speaking of inclusivity—how do we engage local communities effectively in planning processes? Ensuring their voices are heard is essential for creating solutions that truly meet their needs.

>>Sociologist: You see, participatory planning models have shown promise in various contexts by involving residents directly in decision-making processes about their neighborhoods' future development plans.

>>Community Activist: Yeah! Like those town hall meetings where everyone gets a say—not just developers or city officials but actual people living there day-to-day!

>>Economist: Right—and data supports this too! Communities involved early on tend towards better outcomes overall because they feel ownership over changes happening around them rather than being passive recipients affected by external decisions made elsewhere. 
 >>Urban Planner: You know, when communities are involved in urban planning, they tend to be healthier and less stressed. It's not just about building better roads or parks; it's about making sure people feel connected and valued in their neighborhoods.

>>Sociologist: Absolutely. Improved infrastructure is great, but we can't forget the social aspect. When people are displaced, they lose their support networks, which can lead to serious mental health issues.

>>Community Activist: Exactly! We need to focus on the people who are being pushed out of their homes. The stress and anxiety from displacement can have severe health impacts, especially on vulnerable groups like the elderly and low-income families. We need solutions that protect our residents.

>>Economist: Right, while gentrification can bring some benefits like better infrastructure, it also causes financial stress for those who get displaced. This often leads to higher healthcare costs because of increased stress and anxiety.

>>Historian: If we look at more recent history, like the urban renewal projects in the 1960s in the U.S., we see similar patterns. Displacement disrupted communities and led to long-term health disparities. It's important to learn from these past mistakes.

>>Urban Planner: So true. We need a balanced approach that improves infrastructure without harming community well-being. Maybe we could integrate more green spaces and community gardens into our plans—they're great for both physical and mental health.

>>Sociologist: And let's not forget about maintaining social structures. When people are uprooted, it's not just a physical move; it disrupts their entire lives and erodes community resilience.

>>Economist: Agreed. Market trends show that while gentrification can improve some aspects of life, it often comes at a high cost for those who are forced out. We should look at policies that offer financial assistance or affordable housing options to mitigate these effects.

>>Community Activist: Yes! We need policies that keep people in their homes and maintain community integrity. What if we looked into rent control measures or community land trusts?

>>Urban Planner: Those are great ideas! Also, involving residents in decision-making processes can help ensure that development meets their needs without causing harm.

>>Sociologist: Definitely. Community engagement is key to creating sustainable solutions that benefit everyone. 
 >>Community Activist: Inclusionary zoning is a great start, but we also need community land trusts to keep housing affordable for locals. Community first, right?
>>Urban Planner: Community land trusts are great for keeping homes affordable long-term, but we also need to think about adding green spaces and mixed-use areas to make neighborhoods vibrant and inclusive.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely, and we must also consider how these elements affect long-term residents' sense of belonging and community resilience. It's important that any development keeps the cultural heritage and social bonds intact.
>>Economist: Economic stability is crucial, and data shows that inclusionary zoning can help maintain affordability. But if the costs are too high for developers, they might stop building altogether, which could worsen housing shortages.
>>Historian: That's a good point, Economist. Historically, gentrification often erases cultural heritage and community identity. For instance—
[Notification sound]
>>Urban Planner: Oops, sorry about that! Let me turn those off.
>>Historian: No worries! Happens to all of us. As I was saying... in ancient Rome, replacing small shops with large villas changed the social fabric significantly. We need strategies that not only focus on economic stability but also preserve neighborhood character and history.
>>Urban Planner: Indeed, sustainable growth is key. How can we balance affordable housing with green spaces and mixed-use developments to create vibrant neighborhoods?
>>Sociologist: And while we're at it, let's think about how these changes impact the social fabric of the community. Do inclusionary zoning and community land trusts help long-term residents feel like they still belong? We need measures that provide affordable housing while maintaining cultural heritage and social bonds.
>>Community Activist: Look, we can't just talk about what's feasible for developers. We need to prioritize people already living here. Community land trusts and inclusionary zoning are steps in the right direction, but we also need rent control and stronger tenant protections. Every voice matters.
[Audio cuts out briefly]
>>Urban Planner: Sociologist? I think your audio cut out for a second there.
>>Community Activist: Yeah, we missed what you were saying.
[Sociologist reconnects]
>>Sociologist: Apologies! As I was saying... while rent control and stronger tenant protections are necessary steps... 
 >>Urban Planner: To ensure our sustainable growth strategies are effectively implemented, we need to assign specific roles for follow-up tasks. For instance, who will take the lead on coordinating with local communities to gather their input on proposed developments?

>>Community Activist: I can take the lead on that. It's crucial we gather their input to make sure our developments truly reflect their needs and priorities. Community first, you know?

>>Sociologist: Considering the community impact, it's essential to use tools that facilitate transparent and inclusive communication. How about we set up a shared document where everyone can contribute their feedback on the proposed developments? This way, we ensure all voices are heard and integrated into our planning process.

>>Economist: To ensure economic stability and inclusivity, we should set clear deadlines for project milestones and consider financial incentives for developers who meet our criteria. Data shows timely completion of tasks can significantly reduce costs and improve overall efficiency.

>>Historian: History teaches us that urban development without community involvement often leads to long-term negative consequences. We must learn from past mistakes and ensure our strategies are inclusive and respectful of existing communities.

>>Urban Planner: To facilitate our virtual collaboration, I suggest using a project management tool like Trello or Asana. These platforms allow us to assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress in real-time.

>>Sociologist: It's not just about setting up tools and deadlines. We need to ensure our virtual collaboration methods foster genuine community engagement. How can we make sure the voices of those who are often marginalized are actively included in these shared documents?

>>Community Activist: Exactly! It's not just about having tools but ensuring people know how to use them and feel comfortable doing so. Maybe we could organize some training sessions or workshops? Or even have one-on-one support available?

>>Economist: Implementing a weighted feedback system in our shared documents could help too. This ensures input from underrepresented groups is given more consideration, balancing the overall decision-making process.

>>Urban Planner: Good point! Regular check-ins specifically designed to gather feedback from marginalized groups could help too. This way, their voices are actively included in our planning process.

[Interrupting] >>Sociologist: And participatory tools like online forums or community surveys might be effective as well...

[Overlapping] >>Community Activist: Yes! They can reach those who may not have regular access to more traditional forms of engagement.

[Continuing] >>Economist: And for economic stability, let's consider financial incentives for developers who meet our inclusive and sustainable development criteria. Market trends indicate such incentives drive better compliance and faster project completion. 
 >>Community Activist: You know, I've been thinking about how we can make sure long-term residents really get a say in these developments. Maybe we could set up regular community meetings where they can directly share their concerns and ideas with developers.

>>Sociologist: It's really important that we keep our community's culture intact. How do we make sure new developments don't just focus on economic growth but also preserve our cultural heritage and social bonds?

>>Urban Planner: What if we look into community land trusts? They could help keep housing affordable and prevent displacement, while still promoting sustainable growth.

>>Economist: Community land trusts can definitely help stabilize housing prices and prevent displacement. But we also need to think about whether developers will find it financially feasible. Without the right incentives, they might not be interested.

>>Sociologist: Right, and it's crucial that these partnerships actually reflect what long-term residents need. We can't just create affordable housing; we have to maintain the social structures that support our community identity.

>>Community Activist: Another thing is the impact of short-term rentals like Airbnb on our housing market. They can drive up rents and reduce the availability of long-term housing for residents. Maybe we should consider some regulations to balance tourism with community needs.

>>Historian: Historically, when urban development happens too quickly without community input, it often leads to social fragmentation. Sustainable growth has to include the voices of those who have lived here for generations.

>>Urban Planner: Good point about short-term rentals. What if we explore regulations that balance tourism with community needs? This could help keep long-term housing available and affordable for residents.

>>Economist: Yeah, studies show short-term rentals like Airbnb can really impact local markets. Regulating them could definitely help stabilize things for long-term residents.

>>Community Activist: And let's not forget about commercial developments pushing out small family-owned shops. Big chains can take over, which hurts our local businesses that have been part of the community for years. We need policies to support these local businesses and keep our neighborhoods unique. 
 >>Urban Planner: To ensure sustainable growth, we must integrate community land trusts and inclusionary zoning policies. These measures can help maintain affordability while fostering vibrant neighborhoods.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely! Preserving social networks is crucial amidst urban development. We need strategies that support community resilience without disrupting long-standing relationships.
>>Economist: I agree with both of you. Inclusionary zoning can stabilize the economy while promoting affordable housing—market trends show it helps prevent displacement too.
>>Community Activist: Exactly! And we need stronger tenant protections as well. Developers shouldn't push out long-term residents just for profit—community first!
>>Historian: Historically speaking, gentrification has often displaced residents. We must learn from past mistakes to protect these communities while promoting sustainable growth now.
>>Urban Planner: Right, integrating sustainable principles into our planning is key—green spaces and affordable housing are essential for inclusive neighborhoods.
>>Sociologist: Speaking of resilience, it's not just about social networks but also economic stability within communities—
>>Economist (interrupting): Sorry—quick question on that point. Are you focusing mainly on social aspects or economic factors too?
>>Sociologist: Good question! Mainly social networks but economic factors matter too—it’s about emotional support plus financial stability within communities.
>>Economist: Got it, thanks!
>>Community Activist: And like I said earlier—we need those community land trusts and tenant protections strong enough so developers can't displace residents for profit!"
