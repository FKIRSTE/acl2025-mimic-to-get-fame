Legislative Process,"

A legislature (UK: /ˈlɛdʒɪslətʃər/, US: /-sleɪtʃər/)[1][2] is a deliberative assembly with the legal authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country, nation or city on behalf of the people therein. They are often contrasted with the executive and judicial powers of government. Legislatures can exist at different levels of government–national, state/provincial/regional, local, even supranational (such as the European Parliament). Countries differ as to what extent they grant deliberative assemblies at the subnational law-making power, as opposed to purely administrative responsibilities.

Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the budget involved.

The members of a legislature are called legislators. In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper house.

The name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country. 

Common names include:

By languages:

Though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.

Among the earliest recognised formal legislatures was the Athenian Ecclesia.[3] In the Middle Ages, European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.[3] These were often named the Estates. The oldest surviving legislature is the Icelandic Althing, founded in 930 CE.[4]

Democratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.[3]

There exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:[3]

One of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.[3] This activity can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, such as the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the floor of the legislature frequently sees lively debate.[3] In contrast, in committee-based legislatures like the United States Congress, deliberation takes place in closed committees.[3]

While legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In Westminster-style legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in continental Europe and those in presidential systems of the Americas have more independence in drafting and amending bills.[5]

The origins of the power of the purse which legislatures typically have in passing or denying government budgets goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the monarchs would have to consult before raising taxes.[6] For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.[6]

There are several ways in which the legislature can hold the executive branch (the administration or government) accountable. This can be done through hearings, questioning, interpellations, votes of confidence, the formation of committees.[7] Parliaments are usually ensured with upholding the rule of law, verifying that public funds are used accountably and efficiently as well as make government processes transparent and actions so that they can be debated by the public and its representatives.[7]

Agora notes that parliamentary systems or political parties in which political leaders can influence or decide which members receive top jobs can lead to passivity amongst members of the party and less challenging of leadership.[7] Agora notes that this phenomenon is acute if the election of a member is dependent on the support of political leadership.[7]

In contrast to democratic systems, legislatures under authoritarianism are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:[8]

Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a quorum.

Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).

The members of a legislature usually represent different political parties; the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs.

Legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield, compared to other political players such as judiciaries, militaries, and executives. In 2009, political scientists M. Steven Fish and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary powers index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German Bundestag, the Italian Parliament, and the Mongolian State Great Khural tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's House of Representatives and Somalia's Transitional Federal Assembly (since replaced by the Federal Parliament of Somalia) tied for least powerful.[9]

Some political systems follows the principle of legislative supremacy, which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written constitution. Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.

In parliamentary and semi-presidential systems of government, the executive is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a vote of no confidence. On the other hand, according to the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive.[10] Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the impeachment of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.

Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies.[11]

Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as legislators, who vote on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of ""seats"" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 ""seats"" has 100 members. By extension, an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a ""seat"", as, for example, in the phrases ""safe seat"" and ""marginal seat"".[12]

After election, the members may be protected by parliamentary immunity or parliamentary privilege, either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.

A legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies, called by various names including legislative chambers, debate chambers, and houses, which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral, one divided into two chambers is bicameral, and one divided into three chambers is tricameral.

In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the upper house, while the other is considered the lower house. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly parliamentary systems, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly federal presidential systems, the upper house has equal or even greater power. 

In federations, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the European Union. The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments – as in the European Union and in Germany and, before 1913, in the United States – or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in Australia and the United States since 1913.

Tricameral legislatures are rare; the Massachusetts Governor's Council still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in South Africa. Tetracameral legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia. The only legislature with a number of chambers bigger than four was the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia; initially established as a Pentacameral body in 1963, it was turned into a hexacameral body in 1967.

Legislatures vary widely in their size. Among national legislatures, China's National People's Congress is the largest with 2,980 members,[13] while Vatican City's Pontifical Commission is the smallest with 7.[14] Neither legislature is democratically elected: The Pontifical Commission members are appointed by the Pope and the National People's Congress is indirectly elected within the context of a one-party state.[13][15]

Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents. Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country's lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly.[16]

Excited to get started today. We're here to talk about legislative processes, how they impact governance, and encourage some creative thinking.
>>Legislative Advisor: Sounds good! Let's jump into our first topic. How do these procedures affect everyday policy-making?
>>Historian: That's a great point. Historically, legislative processes have always been tied to societal changes. Formal assemblies often reflected new attitudes towards governance and rights.
>>Legal Scholar: I agree with both of you. From a legal perspective, these procedures ensure accountability and transparency in governance.
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! Legislative processes require a balance between representation and efficiency to be effective.
>>Legislative Advisor: Right, and the practical challenges legislators face include balancing thorough deliberation with timely policy implementation. It's not just about creating laws but ensuring they are effective and responsive to current needs. 
 >>Historian: Historically speaking, the Athenian Ecclesia and the Icelandic Althing are prime examples of early legislative bodies. These assemblies began to formalize decision-making processes, laying the groundwork for modern legislatures.
>>Political Scientist: Right, these historical examples influenced contemporary legislative practices significantly. We can see their impact in how modern governance structures prioritize representation and deliberation.
>>Legislative Advisor: From my perspective, it's fascinating how these early bodies balanced thorough discussion with making decisions quickly—something we still aim for today.
>>Legal Scholar: Legally speaking, these structures laid the foundation for principles of accountability and transparency in governance. It's interesting to see how they managed to create systems that ensure fair representation.
>>Political Scientist: Moreover, the evolution of these early legislative bodies highlights a significant shift towards structured deliberation and representation. They not only formalized decision-making but also set up principles that guide our current practices around accountability and transparency.
>>Legislative Advisor: Let's consider how these early legislative bodies managed to balance thorough deliberation with timely decision-making. Their structured processes allowed for effective governance while ensuring representation and accountability.
>>Historian: From a historical perspective, we must remember that these early legislative bodies were not just about formalizing decision-making processes. They represented a significant shift towards inclusive governance where citizens had a voice in public affairs.
>>Political Scientist: Furthermore, their significance cannot be overstated. We need to consider how their principles of inclusive governance and structured deliberation have shaped modern democratic practices.
>>Legislative Advisor: You see, they managed to balance thorough deliberation with timely decision-making—something modern legislatures strive for today. 
 >>Political Scientist: The key point here is that democratic legislatures do more than just make laws. They're crucial for representing people, debating important issues, and keeping an eye on the government. Plus, they decide how money is spent and help form governments.
>>Historian: Absolutely! If we look back in history, it's fascinating to see how democratic legislatures have evolved. From ancient Athens to today's parliaments, they've always adapted to ensure representation and accountability. For instance, medieval assemblies required monarchs to consult with nobility before raising taxes—this was an early form of budget oversight.
>>Legislative Advisor: Right, and practically speaking, when legislatures control the budget, they hold significant power over policy decisions. Take education funding as an example; if a legislature prioritizes it, we can see real improvements in schools and universities.
>>Legal Scholar: Legally speaking, it's essential that legislatures follow constitutional norms when authorizing expenditures. This ensures transparency and prevents misuse of public funds. These legal frameworks are vital for effective oversight.
>>Political Scientist: That's true. We also need to think about the balance between legislative independence and executive influence. In systems like Westminster, sometimes the executive can overshadow the legislature's role in thorough scrutiny.
>>Legislative Advisor: Exactly! When legislatures hold hearings and question officials, they're not just preventing corruption—they're ensuring policies are implemented effectively. Regular scrutiny of public spending can highlight inefficiencies and suggest better ways to allocate resources.
>>Historian: And historically speaking, this practice has deep roots. Medieval monarchs had to seek approval from assemblies before imposing taxes—this laid the groundwork for modern budgetary oversight.
>>Political Scientist: Indeed! Balancing legislative independence with executive influence is crucial for good governance. If the executive dominates too much, legislatures might struggle with their oversight roles.
>>Legislative Advisor: Legislative oversight isn't just about preventing corruption; it's also about making sure policies work well in practice. For example, when legislatures conduct hearings and question officials, they can identify gaps in policy execution and recommend improvements.
>>Historian: From a historical perspective—the role of legislatures in forming governments has been significant too—in early parliamentary systems like the English Parliament—the monarch's reliance on legislative bodies laid the foundation for modern practices—highlighting the importance of balanced governance.
>>Political Scientist: Moreover—we need to consider—the role of legislatures—in ensuring public funds are used efficiently—and transparently—this oversight function—is not just about preventing corruption—but also optimizing resource allocation—to meet societal needs effectively—you know—a legislature's ability—to scrutinize expenditures can significantly impact—the quality of governance.
>>Legislative Advisor: To put it simply—legislative oversight—is like a watchdog—for government actions—you see—when legislatures question officials—and scrutinize policies—they ensure everything runs smoothly—and transparently—for example regular audits—of public spending can highlight inefficiencies—and suggest better ways—to allocate resources. 
 >>Legal Scholar: When we talk about legislative oversight, it's crucial to ensure accountability. Legislatures should have the power to amend budgets and scrutinize executive actions effectively. The real question is whether committee-based systems provide a more thorough examination of policies compared to Westminster-style debates.

>>Political Scientist: That's an interesting point. Committee-based systems often allow for more specialized scrutiny of policies, which can lead to nuanced decisions. But does this depth outweigh the potential for slower legislative processes? For instance, I've seen cases where detailed scrutiny delayed urgent policy responses.

>>Legislative Advisor: In practice, committee-based legislatures do offer detailed scrutiny but can slow down the process significantly. While thorough examination is crucial, we must balance it with efficiency to ensure timely policy implementation. Have you encountered situations where this balance was successfully achieved?

>>Historian: Historically, legislative systems have evolved as reflections of societal needs and priorities. Committee-based systems emerged as societies sought specialized scrutiny to address complex governance issues. Take the U.S., for example—its committees have been pivotal in shaping comprehensive healthcare reforms despite initial delays.

>>Political Scientist: Moreover—and here's where it gets tricky—the impact on governance efficiency is significant. While committee-based systems may offer detailed scrutiny, they can also lead to bureaucratic inertia. How do we find a balance that ensures both thorough examination and timely decision-making?

>>Legislative Advisor: The practical application often reveals strengths and weaknesses in these systems. Committee-based legislatures might offer detailed scrutiny but can delay policy implementation. Is this trade-off worth it for the depth provided? What are some examples you've seen where this trade-off was beneficial or detrimental?

>>Historian: From a historical perspective, the shift towards committee-based systems was driven by a need for specialized scrutiny in governance. This evolution reflects society's growing complexity and demand for detailed examination of policies—like how post-war Europe adapted its legislative processes to manage reconstruction efforts efficiently.

>>Legal Scholar: Like I said earlier, the key consideration here is whether these committees justify potential delays in policy implementation with their depth of examination.

>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! The challenge lies in finding that balance between thorough examination and efficient decision-making without falling into bureaucratic inertia.

>>Legislative Advisor: It's about understanding if the trade-off between depth and speed is justified by real-world outcomes. 
 >>Political Scientist: What we need to consider is the effectiveness of accountability mechanisms in different political systems. While committee-based systems may offer specialized scrutiny, they often face challenges in terms of speed and efficiency.
>>Historian: Historically, financial control was crucial in limiting monarchs' power—similar to how modern legislatures use budget amendments to ensure accountability today. This development laid the groundwork for legislative oversight as we know it.
>>Legislative Advisor: In practice, these systems can provide detailed oversight but may slow down decision-making processes. The challenge is finding a balance that ensures both efficiency and comprehensive examination.
>>Political Scientist: Another important aspect is that votes of confidence and interpellations are crucial tools for ensuring executive transparency.
>>Legal Scholar: Could you explain what 'interpellations' are? I think some might not be familiar with that term.
>>Political Scientist: Sure! Interpellations are formal questions posed by legislators to government ministers regarding their policies or actions. They hold ministers accountable and ensure transparency within the executive branch.
>>Legal Scholar: Got it, thanks!
>>Political Scientist: No problem! So as I was saying...in systems where political leaders wield significant influence over appointments, these mechanisms can become mere formalities rather than effective checks on power.
>>Legal Scholar: Legally speaking, robust frameworks are essential to ensure these mechanisms are effective rather than symbolic. We must consider whether these systems empower legislatures or merely serve as gestures without real impact.
>>Historian: From a historical perspective, these mechanisms have roots in early legislative practices where assemblies sought to hold rulers accountable through financial control and oversight. The development of votes of confidence and interpellations reflects a continuous effort to balance power between the legislature and executive.
>>Political Scientist: The effectiveness of these mechanisms often depends on the political culture and institutional design within a system. In some cases, they serve as genuine checks on executive power while in others they're more like ceremonial gestures that fail to hold leaders accountable.
>>Legislative Advisor: That’s an interesting point about committee-based systems providing thorough examination. If integrated well into the legislative process, they can effectively hold the executive accountable—but we need to understand if these systems truly empower legislatures or just maintain the status quo. 
 >>Historian: Historically speaking, bicameralism has roots in medieval European assemblies where nobility and clergy were separated from commoners. This structure aimed to balance different interests within society, ensuring that both elite and popular voices were heard. The establishment of the British Parliament's two houses set a precedent for modern bicameral systems.
>>Political Scientist: That's an interesting point about historical roots. Do you think modern bicameral systems still reflect those original intentions? Bicameralism can be seen as a mechanism to ensure more comprehensive representation and scrutiny. However, we must consider whether this added layer of deliberation might lead to inefficiencies in passing laws swiftly.
>>Legislative Advisor: I agree with your point about efficiency concerns. While bicameral systems provide thorough scrutiny, they often lead to slower legislative processes. We need to understand how these structures impact real-world policy implementation and governance efficiency.
>>Legal Scholar: Legally speaking, the fundamental principle is that bicameralism provides checks and balances within the legislative process. This dual-chamber structure ensures that legislation undergoes rigorous scrutiny, reducing the risk of arbitrary or poorly considered laws. How do you think we can mitigate these delays while maintaining thorough scrutiny?
>>Political Scientist: Moreover, what we need to consider is the balance between efficiency and representation. Bicameral systems can sometimes lead to legislative gridlock due to their thoroughness, whereas unicameral systems might expedite decision-making but at the cost of comprehensive examination.
>>Legislative Advisor: From my perspective, while bicameral systems offer robust checks and balances, they can sometimes hinder swift policy implementation. Conversely, unicameral systems might expedite legislative processes but could compromise on thorough scrutiny.
>>Historian: From a historical perspective—bicameralism was designed not just for balancing power but also for ensuring comprehensive representation. Today, this structure continues to influence how diverse societal interests are voiced in legislative processes. 
 >>Political Scientist: You know, exploring tricameral legislative bodies could really change how we think about representation and governance. It might help us include more diverse viewpoints in decision-making processes.
>>Legislative Advisor: That's an interesting idea! But practically speaking, wouldn't it complicate coordination? We need efficiency too—how do we balance that?
>>Historian: Historically, complex systems like Yugoslavia's hexacameral structure aimed at balancing interests but struggled with efficiency. Maybe there's something we can learn from their experience?
>>Political Scientist: True! While these structures can enhance representation theoretically, they also bring coordination challenges. Do you think it's worth pursuing despite these drawbacks?
>>Legislative Advisor: If we were to try this today, we'd need clear roles for each chamber and strong communication mechanisms to avoid gridlock. Any thoughts on how we could achieve that?
>>Historian: Exactly! Balancing diverse interests without losing efficiency is key. Perhaps modern technology could help streamline coordination better than in the past?
>>Legal Scholar: Legally speaking, accountability and transparency are crucial too. We'd need robust inter-chamber coordination mechanisms—any ideas on what those might look like? 
 >>Legislative Advisor: We need to make sure our plans work in real life. Clear communication and knowing who does what are crucial. Let's focus on these points and figure out the next steps for our follow-up meetings.
>>Political Scientist: Right, but we also need to balance efficiency with thorough scrutiny in our legislative processes. If we don't, we'll end up with a system that's either too slow or too sloppy.
>>Historian: Historically, balancing efficiency with scrutiny has always been key. Early assemblies like the Athenian Ecclesia and Icelandic Althing showed us that inclusive governance is possible. We should keep this in mind as we move forward.
>>Legal Scholar: And from a legal standpoint, we need strong laws to make sure everything works as planned. It's not enough to have good ideas; they need to be enforceable.
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone pauses briefly)
>>(Phone stops ringing)
>>(Meeting resumes without comment)
>>Political Scientist: As I was saying, it's important that our coordination mechanisms are practical and enforceable. Modern technology can help us improve communication channels significantly.
>>Legislative Advisor: Good point about technology. So let's summarize: clear communication, defined roles, and making sure everything is enforceable. These will guide our next steps.
>>Historian: Absolutely. And remember, historical examples like the Athenian Ecclesia remind us that inclusive governance is achievable if we prioritize these concepts together.
>>(Participants nod in agreement)
>>Political Scientist: But how do we ensure these historical lessons actually inform our current practices? At the end of the day—
>>(Participants chuckle lightly at interruption)
—prioritizing clear communication and defined roles will make sure our plans aren't just theoretical but workable in practice.
>>(Participants smile briefly before refocusing on discussion)
>>Legal Scholar: Exactly. We need solid legal frameworks to back up our plans so they hold up in real-world scenarios too."
