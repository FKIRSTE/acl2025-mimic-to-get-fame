Criminology (from Latin crimen, 'accusation', and Ancient Greek -λογία, -logia, from λόγος logos, 'word, reason') is the interdisciplinary study of crime and deviant behaviour.[1] Criminology is a multidisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences, which draws primarily upon the research of sociologists, political scientists, economists, legal sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, psychiatrists, social workers, biologists, social anthropologists, scholars of law and jurisprudence, as well as the processes that define administration of justice and the criminal justice system.

The interests of criminologists include the study of the nature of crime and criminals, origins of criminal law, etiology of crime, social reaction to crime, and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. It can be broadly said that criminology directs its inquiries along three lines: first, it investigates the nature of criminal law and its administration and conditions under which it develops; second, it analyzes the causation of crime and the personality of criminals; and third, it studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. Thus, criminology includes within its scope the activities of legislative bodies, law-enforcement agencies, judicial institutions, correctional institutions and educational, private and public social agencies.

Modern academic criminology has direct roots in the 19th-century Italian School of ""criminal anthropology"", which according to the historian Mary Gibson ""caused a radical refocusing of criminological discussion throughout Europe and the United States from law to the criminal. While this 'Italian School' was in turn attacked and partially supplanted in countries such as France by 'sociological' theories of delinquency, they retained the new focus on the criminal.""[2] According to Gibson, the term criminology was most likely coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as Criminologia [it].[2] In the late 19th century, French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term Criminologie [fr].[3]

Criminology grew substantially as a discipline in the first quarter of the twentieth century. From 1900 through to 2000 this field of research underwent three significant phases in the United States: (1) Golden Age of Research (1900–1930) which has been described as a multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930–1960) which endeavored to show the limits of systematically connecting criminological research to theory, and (3) a 1960–2000 period, which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology.[4]

There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory, spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: Classical, Positivist, and Chicago. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labelling, critical criminology, cultural criminology, postmodern criminology, feminist criminology, Queer criminology, and others discussed below.

The Classical school arose in the mid-18th century and reflects ideas from utilitarian philosophy.[5] Cesare Beccaria,[6] author of On Crimes and Punishments (1763–64), Jeremy Bentham (inventor of the panopticon), and other early criminological philosophers proposed ideas including:[7]

This school developed during a major reform in penology when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the French Revolution, and the development of the legal system in the United States.[9]

The Positivist school argues criminal behaviour comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Its key method of thought is that criminals are born as criminals and not made into them;[10] this school of thought also supports theory of nature in the debate between nature versus nurture. They also argue that criminal behavior is innate and within a person. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: biological, psychological and social positivism.[11]

Psychological Positivism is the concept that criminal acts or the people doing said crimes do them because of internal factors driving them.

Social Positivism, which is often referred to as Sociological Positivism, discusses the thought process that criminals are produced by society. This school claims that low income levels, high poverty/unemployment rates, and poor educational systems create and motivate criminals.[12]

The notion of having a criminal personality is achieved from the school of thought of psychological positivism. It essentially means that parts of an individual's personality have traits that align with many of those possessed by criminals, such as neuroticism, anti-social tendencies, aggressive behaviors, and other factors. There is evidence of correlation, but not causation, between these personality traits and criminal actions.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]

Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called ""the father of criminology"".[21] He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the Italian school of criminology.[22] Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.[23]  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheekbones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate ""atavistic"" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of phrenology and by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has been superseded. Enrico Ferri, a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories since control groups were not used in his studies.[24][25]

Sociological positivism suggests societal factors such as poverty, membership of subcultures, or low levels of education can predispose people to crime. Adolphe Quetelet used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime.[26] Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one supporting education reduces crime.[27] Rawson W. Rawson used crime statistics to suggest a link between population density and crime rates, with crowded cities producing more crime.[28] Joseph Fletcher and John Glyde read papers to the Statistical Society of London on their studies of crime and its distribution.[29] Henry Mayhew used empirical methods and an ethnographic approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in London Labour and the London Poor.[30] Émile Durkheim viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

Differential association (sub-cultural) posits that people learn crime through association. This theory was advocated by Edwin Sutherland, who focused on how ""a person becomes delinquent because of an excess of definitions favorable to violation of law over definitions unfavorable to violation of law.""[31] Associating with people who may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances makes one more likely to take that view, under his theory. Interacting with this type of ""antisocial"" peer is a major cause of delinquency. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal subcultures, many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.[32]

The Chicago school arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of Robert E. Park, Ernest Burgess, and other urban sociologists at the University of Chicago.  In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five concentric zones that often exist as cities grow, including the ""zone of transition"", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw focused on juvenile delinquents, finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition. The Chicago School was a school of thought developed that blames social structures for human behaviors. This thought can be associated or used within criminology, because it essentially takes the stance of defending criminals and criminal behaviors. The defense and argument lies in the thoughts that these people and their acts are not their faults but they are actually the result of society (i.e. unemployment, poverty, etc.), and these people are actually, in fact, behaving properly.[33]

Chicago school sociologists adopted a social ecology approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience a breakdown in the social structure and institutions, such as family and schools.  This results in social disorganization, which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for deviant behavior.

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  Edwin Sutherland suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate.

Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include psychoanalysis, functionalism, interactionism, Marxism, econometrics, systems theory, postmodernism, behavioural genetics, personality psychology, evolutionary psychology, etc.

This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a conflict theory or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.[34]

Social disorganization theory is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.[35]  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover.[36] This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, 'subcultures' or 'gangs'. These groups have different values to the social norm. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity.[36] With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community.

Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.[36][37] As working and middle-class people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. William Julius Wilson suggested a poverty ""concentration effect"", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.[38]

Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim.  Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (such as gang members, or what he calls ""hobos""). Robert Agnew developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as general strain theory.[39]

Following the Chicago school and strain theory, and also drawing on Edwin Sutherland's idea of differential association, sub-cultural theorists focused on small cultural groups fragmenting away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life.

Albert K. Cohen tied anomie theory with Sigmund Freud's reaction formation idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower-class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class.[40]  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include ""toughness"" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.[41]

Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth.[42]  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as minimum wage-paying jobs available to them.[42]

Delinquency tends to occur among the lower-working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies, where officers tend to place a bias on minority groups, without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not.

British sub-cultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of class, where some criminal activities were seen as ""imaginary solutions"" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

Sociologists such as Raymond D. Gastil have explored the impact of a Southern culture of honor on violent crime rates.[43]

Another approach is made by the social bond or social control theory. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do not become criminal. Travis Hirschi identified four main characteristics: ""attachment to others"", ""belief in moral validity of rules"", ""commitment to achievement"", and ""involvement in conventional activities"".[44]  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).  On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low self-control is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime.[45]

A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one.  If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Social bonds, through peers, parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control.  For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or chaperonage.[46] In addition, theorists such as David Matza and Gresham Sykes argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social-behavioral constraints through techniques of neutralization.

Psychoanalysis is a psychological theory (and therapy) which regards the unconscious mind, repressed memories and trauma, as the key drivers of behavior, especially deviant behavior.[47] Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his essay, Beyond the Pleasure Principle,.[47] Freud suggested that unconscious impulses such as 'repetition compulsion' and a 'death drive' can dominate a person's creativity, leading to self-destructive behavior. Phillida Rosnick, in the article Mental Pain and Social Trauma, posits a difference in the thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain which corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings which are not reflections of their true selves. There is enough correlation between this altered state of mind and criminality to suggest causation.[48] Sander Gilman, in the article Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis, looks for evidence in the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system and suggests there is a direct link between an unconscious desire for pain or punishment and the impulse to commit crime or deviant acts.[49]

Symbolic interactionism draws on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and George Herbert Mead, as well as subcultural theory and conflict theory.[50] This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the ""significant other"" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating meaning. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to ""label"" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become actors in the ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by Howard Becker and Edwin Lemert, in the mid-20th century.[51] Stanley Cohen developed the concept of ""moral panic"" describing the societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the Mods and Rockers in the UK in 1964, AIDS epidemic and football hooliganism).

Labeling theory refers to an individual who is labeled by others in a particular way. The theory was studied in great detail by Becker.[52] It was originally derived from sociology, but is regularly used in criminological studies. When someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to deviancy amplification. Malcolm Klein conducted a test which showed that labeling theory affected some youth offenders but not others.[53]

At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist Lonnie Athens developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. Richard Rhodes' Why They Kill describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.[54]

Rational choice theory is based on the utilitarian, classical school philosophies of Cesare Beccaria, which were popularized by Jeremy Bentham.  They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In Dei delitti e delle pene (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763–1764), Beccaria advocated a rational penology. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to confirm his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and sin, and advocated against the death penalty, as well as torture and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents.

This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of James Q. Wilson, Gary Becker's 1965 article Crime and Punishment[55] and George Stigler's 1970 article The Optimum Enforcement of Laws.[56] Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms.[57] They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.[57]

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing surveillance, one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

With this perspective, crime prevention or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as target hardening.[58] Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime.[58]

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the panopticon), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and classical liberalism have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.

Such rational choice theories, linked to neoliberalism, have been at the basics of crime prevention through environmental design and underpin the Market Reduction Approach to theft [59] by Mike Sutton, which is a systematic toolkit for those seeking to focus attention on ""crime facilitators"" by tackling the markets for stolen goods[60] that provide motivation for thieves to supply them by theft.[61]

Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.[62] A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.[63] A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.[63] Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of ""place manager"" such as rental property managers who can take nuisance abatement measures.[64]

Biosocial criminology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as behavioral genetics, personality psychology, and evolutionary psychology.[65] Various theoretical frameworks such as evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory have sought to explain trends in criminality through the lens of evolutionary biology. Specifically, they seek to explain why criminality is so much higher in men than in women and why young men are most likely to exhibit criminal behavior.[66] See also: genetics of aggression.

Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: serotonin systems, catecholamine systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.[67]

Biosocial approaches remain very controversial within the scientific field.[68][69]

In 1968, young British sociologists formed the National Deviance Conference (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. Ian Taylor, Paul Walton and Jock Young – members of the NDC – rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.[70] In The New Criminology, they argued against the biological ""positivism"" perspective represented by Lombroso, Hans Eysenck and Gordon Trasler.[71]

According to the Marxist perspective on crime, ""defiance is normal – the sense that men are now consciously involved ... in assuring their human diversity."" Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.[72] They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.[73]

State crime is a distinct field of crimes that is studied by Marxist criminology, which considers these crimes to be some of the most costly to society in terms of overall harm/injury. In a Marxist framework, genocides, environmental degradation, and war are not crimes that occur out of contempt for one's fellow man, but are crimes of power. They continue systems of control and hegemony which allow state crime and state-corporate crime, along with state-corporate non-profit criminals, to continue governing people.[74]

Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the criminal justice system, oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison.[75] Martin Leyva argues that ""prisonization"" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools.[76]

According to Rod Earle, Convict Criminology started in the United States after the major expansion of prisons in the 1970s, and the U.S. still remains the main focus for those who study convict criminology.[77]

Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on LGBT individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows:

Legitimacy of Queer criminology:

The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to ""queer"" the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.[78]

As more and more people identify as something other than heterosexual, queer criminology continues to grow in relevance. At the same time, in jurisdictions such as Russia, Uganda, and Ghana, governments have become even more punitive through laws that expand the criminalisation of LGBTQ+ conduct, relationships, and organising.[79] 'Digiqueer criminology' has emerged as a sub discipline of queer criminology and aims to deepen understanding of the relationship between digital technology, LGBTQ+ identity, and justice.[79][80]

Cultural criminology views crime and its control within the context of culture.[81][82] Ferrell believes criminologists can examine the actions of criminals, control agents, media producers, and others to construct the meaning of crime.[82] He discusses these actions as a means to show the dominant role of culture.[82] Kane adds that cultural criminology has three tropes; village, city street, and media, in which males can be geographically influenced by society's views on what is broadcast and accepted as right or wrong.[83] The village is where one engages in available social activities. Linking the history of an individual to a location can help determine social dynamics.[83] The city street involves positioning oneself in the cultural area. This is full of those affected by poverty, poor health and crime, and large buildings that impact the city but not neighborhoods.[83] Mass media gives an all-around account of the environment and the possible other subcultures that could exist beyond a specific geographical area.[83]

It was later that Naegler and Salman introduced feminist theory to cultural criminology and discussed masculinity and femininity, sexual attraction and sexuality, and intersectional themes.[84] Naegler and Salman believed that Ferrell's mold was limited and that they could add to the understanding of cultural criminology by studying women and those who do not fit Ferrell's mold.[84] Hayward would later add that not only feminist theory, but green theory as well, played a role in the cultural criminology theory through the lens of adrenaline, the soft city, the transgressive subject, and the attentive gaze.[81] The adrenaline lens deals with rational choice and what causes a person to have their own terms of availability, opportunity, and low levels of social control.[81] The soft city lens deals with reality outside of the city and the imaginary sense of reality: the world where transgression occurs, where rigidity is slanted, and where rules are bent.[81] The transgressive subject refers to a person who is attracted to rule-breaking and is attempting to be themselves in a world where everyone is against them.[81] The attentive gaze is when someone, mainly an ethnographer, is immersed into the culture and interested in lifestyle(s) and the symbolic, aesthetic, and visual aspects. When examined, they are left with the knowledge that they are not all the same, but come to a settlement of living together in the same space.[81] Through it all, sociological perspective on cultural criminology theory attempts to understand how the environment an individual is in determines their criminal behavior.[82]

Relative deprivation involves the process where an individual measures his or her own well-being and materialistic worth against that of other people and perceive that they are worse off in comparison.[85] When humans fail to obtain what they believe they are owed, they can experience anger or jealousy over the notion that they have been wrongly disadvantaged.

Relative deprivation was originally utilized in the field of sociology by Samuel A. Stouffer, who was a pioneer of this theory. Stouffer revealed that soldiers fighting in World War II measured their personal success by the experience in their units rather than by the standards set by the military.[86] Relative deprivation can be made up of societal, political, economic, or personal factors which create a sense of injustice. It is not based on absolute poverty, a condition where one cannot meet a necessary level to maintain basic living standards. Rather, relative deprivation enforces the idea that even if a person is financially stable, he or she can still feel relatively deprived. The perception of being relatively deprived can result in criminal behavior and/or morally problematic decisions.[87] Relative deprivation theory has increasingly been used to partially explain crime as rising living standards can result in rising crime levels. In criminology, the theory of relative deprivation explains that people who feel jealous and discontent of others might turn to crime to acquire the things that they can not afford.

Rural criminology is the study of crime trends outside of metropolitan and suburban areas. Rural criminologists have used social disorganization and routine activity theories. The FBI Uniform Crime Report shows that rural communities have significantly different crime trends as opposed to metropolitan and suburban areas. The crime in rural communities consists predominantly of narcotic related crimes such as the production, use, and trafficking of narcotics. Social disorganization theory is used to examine the trends involving narcotics.[88] Social disorganization leads to narcotic use in rural areas because of low educational opportunities and high unemployment rates. Routine activity theory is used to examine all low-level street crimes such as theft.[89] Much of the crime in rural areas is explained through routine activity theory because there is often a lack of capable guardians in rural areas.[citation needed]

Public criminology is a strand within criminology closely tied to ideas associated with ""public sociology"", focused on disseminating criminological insights to a broader audience than academia. Advocates of public criminology argue that criminologists should be ""conducting and disseminating research on crime, law, and deviance in dialogue with affected communities.""[90] Its goal is for academics and researchers in criminology to provide their research to the public in order to inform public decisions and policymaking. This allows criminologists to avoid the constraints of traditional criminological research.[91] In doing so, public criminology takes on many forms, including media and policy advising as well as activism, civic-oriented education, community outreach, expert testimony, and knowledge co-production.[92]

Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws:

There have been moves in contemporary criminological theory to move away from liberal pluralism, culturalism, and postmodernism by introducing the universal term ""harm"" into the criminological debate as a replacement for the legal term ""crime"".[93][94]

as criminology. Criminology integrates research from various fields such as sociology, psychology, law, and biology to understand crime's nature, causes, and control. Historical roots trace back to the 19th-century Italian School of criminal anthropology, which shifted focus from law to the criminal. The discipline evolved through significant phases in the 20th century in the United States: Golden Age of Research (1900-1930), Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960), and a transformative period from 1960-2000. Early criminological theories included Classical, Positivist, and Chicago schools, later superseded by contemporary paradigms like sub-culture theory and feminist criminology. Key figures such as Cesare Lombroso contributed to biological positivism but were later critiqued for lack of empirical rigor. Sociological positivism highlighted societal factors influencing crime. Modern theories explore psychological aspects, social bonds, rational choice, routine activities, biosocial factors, and cultural influences on criminal behavior. Emerging fields like convict criminology and queer criminology address specific populations' interactions with the justice system. Public criminology aims to disseminate research insights broadly for informed policymaking.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick check-in on how everyone is doing\n- Set expectations for a relaxed and open discussion"", ""Scene 2: Criminology Overview\nTLDR: Discuss the interdisciplinary nature of criminology and its historical roots.\n- Highlight key points from the summary\n- Mention significant phases in criminology's evolution\n- Encourage participants to share their thoughts on historical perspectives"", ""Scene 3: Theoretical Perspectives\nTLDR: Explore various criminological theories and their impact.\n- Discuss Classical, Positivist, and Chicago schools\n- Introduce contemporary paradigms like sub-culture theory and feminist criminology\n- Invite personal insights or experiences related to these theories"", ""Scene 4: Modern Criminological Theories\nTLDR: Examine modern approaches to understanding crime.\n- Talk about psychological aspects, social bonds, rational choice, routine activities, biosocial factors, and cultural influences\n- Share relevant case studies or examples from participants' work"", ""Scene 5: Emerging Fields in Criminology\nTLDR: Address new areas such as convict criminology and queer criminology.\n- Discuss specific populations' interactions with the justice system\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions or questions"", ""Scene 6: Public Criminology and Policy Implications\nTLDR: Focus on the role of public criminology in policymaking.\n- Highlight importance of disseminating research insights broadly\n- Discuss potential policy changes based on recent findings"", ""Scene 7: Personal Experiences and Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allow space for sharing personal stories or off-topic discussions.\n- Encourage participants to share any relevant personal experiences related to crime or deviance\n- Allow brief off-topic moments to strengthen team rapport"", ""Scene 8: Wrap-Up and Next Steps\nTLDR: Conclude the meeting with final thoughts and future plans.\n- Summarize key points discussed during the meeting\n- Outline any follow-up actions or next steps""]",">>Criminologist: Good morning, everyone! How's everyone doing today?
>>Sociologist: Hey! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. Excited for today's discussion on crime trends.
>>Psychologist: Hi there! I'm good too, looking forward to our talk on mental health impacts.
>>Legal Scholar: Morning all. I’m interested in hearing your thoughts on recent legal changes affecting social work.
>>Social Worker: Hey folks! All good here—ready to discuss community outreach strategies!
>>Historian: Good morning! Doing well—curious about historical perspectives we'll cover today. 
 >>Criminologist: The Italian School's focus on criminals rather than laws was groundbreaking for criminology. It shifted our understanding significantly. How do you think this has influenced modern theories?
>>Sociologist: Definitely! It highlighted how societal factors play into criminal behavior. But I wonder if focusing too much on individual criminals might overlook broader social issues contributing to crime?
>>Historian: That's an interesting point! Historically, this shift did pave the way for considering social contexts in criminology. However, it also led us away from structural critiques that could address systemic issues better.
>>Psychologist: From my perspective, understanding individual behavior is crucial but integrating social context provides a fuller picture for prevention strategies today.
>>Social Worker: I agree with both views; balancing individual-focused approaches with community-based strategies seems essential for effective rehabilitation programs now.
>>Legal Scholar: It's fascinating how these shifts have influenced legal frameworks too. By focusing more on the criminal's background and circumstances, we've developed more nuanced laws and policies.
>>Criminologist: Absolutely, it's all about finding that balance between different perspectives. How do you think we can improve our current approaches to crime prevention and rehabilitation by learning from these historical shifts?
>>Sociologist: Maybe we need to look at more comprehensive community programs that address both individual needs and broader social issues. What do you all think?
>>Historian: Reflecting on history shows us that those foundational ideas laid groundwork for various theories including positivism and sociological approaches considering societal factors in understanding crime. 
 >>Criminologist: So, the Classical school talks about rationality and free will in crime, while the Positivist school says it's all about factors beyond our control—like biology or social stuff. And then there's the Chicago school focusing on urban environments.
>>Sociologist: Yeah, exactly! The Chicago school's take on urban environments is fascinating. Have any of you seen this play out in your work?
>>Psychologist: Definitely. From a psychological standpoint, understanding how societal structures influence individual behavior is key. I've seen cases where disorganized communities lead to higher rates of deviant behavior.
>>Legal Scholar: Interesting point about urban environments influencing crime rates. How do you think contemporary paradigms like feminist criminology are shaping current legal frameworks?
>>Historian: That's a great question! Historically speaking, the Classical and Positivist schools laid the groundwork for modern criminology. But feminist criminology is now challenging these traditional frameworks by highlighting gender biases.
>>Social Worker: Absolutely. From my experience, addressing these biases leads to more equitable treatment and supports marginalized groups better.
>>Sociologist: Speaking of community influence, sub-culture theory suggests people learn criminal behavior from their peers. In my work, I've seen peer groups significantly impact someone's path.
>>Criminologist: Building on that, it's crucial to consider how these peer influences can be mitigated through community programs and interventions.
>>Psychologist: Right! Understanding the mechanisms behind peer influence can help develop more effective prevention strategies. 
 >>Criminologist: You know, it's fascinating how social bonds and rational choices play a role in crime. Hirschi's theory suggests that strong family and community ties can deter criminal behavior, while rational choice theory says people weigh the pros and cons before acting. This mix of personal connections and calculated decisions really helps us understand why people might commit crimes.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely. Routine activity theory also sheds light on this by looking at everyday opportunities for crime. For instance, having vigilant neighbors can lower crime rates significantly. How do you see this playing out in today's urban areas?
>>Psychologist: That's a good point. From a psychological angle, we can't ignore biosocial factors like serotonin levels affecting aggression. It's not just biology; environmental stressors also play a big part. This combination gives us insight into why some people are more prone to criminal behavior.
>>Legal Scholar: Right, and from a legal perspective, these theories shape our laws too. Rational choice theory has influenced sentencing guidelines to focus on deterrence through fair punishment. It's interesting to see how theoretical ideas translate into real-world law enforcement.
>>Historian: Looking back, it's intriguing how these ideas have evolved over time. Early 20th-century criminologists like Edwin Sutherland emphasized social connections in shaping behavior with his differential association theory. How do you think these historical insights can help us tackle modern urban crime?
>>Sociologist: Good question! Cultural criminology adds another layer by examining how media influences criminal behavior through societal norms and values. Ferrell's work shows that culture plays a huge role in shaping actions today.
>>Social Worker: I agree, and from a community standpoint, practical support is key. Mentorship programs can strengthen social bonds and provide positive role models for at-risk youth. How can we integrate these initiatives into our current strategies for preventing urban crime?
>>Criminologist: Definitely! Combining all these perspectives—social bonds, rational choices, biological factors—gives us a fuller picture of crime prevention strategies that could really make a difference in our communities. 
 >>Sociologist: You know, it's fascinating how convict criminology offers insights from those who've actually lived through the system. Understanding their experiences can really help us shape more effective rehabilitation programs.
>>Psychologist: Absolutely! And from a psychological standpoint, it's essential to understand how these experiences shape behavior and mental processes. These insights can help us develop better strategies for rehabilitation.
>>Legal Scholar: I agree with both of you. Legally speaking, considering emerging fields like convict criminology and queer criminology is crucial. The firsthand experiences of those within the system can lead to more nuanced laws and policies that address specific populations' needs.
>>Criminologist: Convict criminology, which involves studying crime from the perspective of former convicts themselves, and queer criminology offer invaluable perspectives that challenge traditional views. It's important to see how these insights can reshape our theoretical frameworks and lead to more inclusive policies.
>>Social Worker: Well, while I see the value in these emerging fields, I'm concerned about how we can practically implement these insights in community programs. They provide unique perspectives, but translating them into actionable steps is another challenge.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, it's interesting to see how convict criminology and queer criminology challenge traditional frameworks. These fields remind us that marginalized groups' experiences have often been overlooked in developing theories. We need to consider how these insights can reshape our understanding and lead to more inclusive policies.
>>Criminologist: Like I said earlier, convict criminology challenges traditional paradigms by incorporating lived experiences of marginalized groups. It's crucial to understand how these insights can reshape our understanding of crime.
>>Sociologist: And queer criminology highlights the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within the justice system. Considering these insights can lead to more equitable policies.
>>Psychologist: In terms of mental processes, it's fascinating to see how convict criminology provides insights into the psychological impacts of systemic interactions. These perspectives help us understand behavioral patterns from unique experiences.
>>Legal Scholar: Indeed! The legal implications are significant when we incorporate such firsthand accounts into our frameworks. It could lead to substantial changes in policy-making.
>>Social Worker: Supporting these emerging fields is important because they give practical insights directly applicable to community programs. For instance, understanding LGBTQ+ individuals' challenges helps tailor rehabilitation efforts effectively!
>>Historian: From a historical perspective, seeing how these fields challenge traditional frameworks is fascinating. They remind us that marginalized groups' experiences have often been overlooked in developing theories. 
 >>Criminologist: Sharing our research widely can really help shape better policies that work for everyone.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely! It's cool how public criminology connects research with real-world policy needs. What do you all think?
>>Psychologist interrupts: I think behavioral analysis could really help here by addressing root causes of crime directly!
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>Sociologist: Oops! Sorry about that! (Everyone laughs) Okay—
>>Criminologist: No worries at all! So yes—sharing these insights widely helps create policies that resonate deeply with community needs.
>>(Historian interjects)
>>Historian: Wait—before we move on—I just wanted to add something quickly about historical trends...
>>(Legal Scholar gestures for Historian to proceed)
>>(Historian continues) We've come a long way from keeping theories within academic circles to engaging communities directly with our findings.
>>(Social Worker nods)
>>Social Worker: That's true, and when we share these findings, it helps create programs that are actually useful in the community. Imagine the impact on local initiatives!
>>(Legal Scholar adds)
>>Legal Scholar: And from a legal perspective, this approach ensures our laws are grounded in solid evidence and reflect what's happening in society.
>>(Everyone nods thoughtfully, some murmuring agreement while others jot down notes) 
 >>Social Worker: You know, I remember working with a young man who had been in and out of juvenile detention. He was really struggling to find his way. But once he got involved in a community mentorship program, things started to change for him.
>>Sociologist: That's great! I worked on a project in a high-crime neighborhood where we started community gardening initiatives. It was amazing to see how crime rates dropped and people felt more connected.
>>Psychologist: Yeah, it's fascinating how these programs can reveal underlying motivations behind behaviors. I had a client who turned to petty theft because he needed acceptance.
>>Legal Scholar: Interesting point! We need to ensure these programs align with laws for sustainability.
>>Historian: True! Community initiatives have evolved since the early 20th century but still aim to foster bonds.
>>Criminologist: While integrating community initiatives with psychological support is beneficial, we also need to consider individual differences that might affect outcomes.
>>Social Worker: You know, I remember working with another young woman who had faced similar struggles. She joined an art therapy program which helped her express herself creatively while dealing with her past traumas.
>>Sociologist: Wow! That's incredible! Did you notice any specific changes in behavior?
>>Psychologist: Absolutely! I've seen firsthand how creative outlets like art or music can be therapeutic for those dealing with criminal behaviors rooted in psychological issues.
>>Legal Scholar: And ensuring these programs are legally supported is key for their long-term success.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, many successful rehabilitation programs have included creative elements as part of their approach. 
 >>Social Worker: Well, we've covered a lot today! From understanding crime trends and mental health impacts to discussing community outreach strategies. It's important to support these initiatives moving forward.

>>Criminologist: Absolutely. Our recent study showed a 20% increase in crime rates related to mental health issues. We need to integrate these insights into actionable plans.

>>Psychologist: That's a significant finding. From a psychological standpoint, understanding behavioral patterns can help address root causes of crime and improve rehabilitation outcomes.

>>Sociologist: I agree with the psychologist’s point about addressing root causes. Additionally, we should look at how these factors impact different communities and create programs that address societal issues holistically.

>>Legal Scholar: Right, and we need to make sure our ideas are backed by strong laws so they last and work well. This will ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of our initiatives.

>>Historian: It's fascinating to see how our discussions have evolved. Historical shifts in criminological theories can inform our future initiatives, helping us understand what has worked in the past and what hasn't."
