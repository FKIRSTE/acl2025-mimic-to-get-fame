Memes,"An Internet meme, or meme (, MEEM), is a cultural item (such as an idea, behavior, or style) that spreads across the Internet, primarily through social media platforms. Internet memes manifest in a variety of formats, including images, videos, GIFs, and other viral content. Newer internet memes are often defined as brain rot. Key characteristics of memes include their tendency to be parodied, their use of intertextuality, their viral dissemination, and their continual evolution. The term meme was originally introduced by Richard Dawkins in 1972 to describe the concept of cultural transmission.
The term Internet meme was coined by Mike Godwin in 1993 in reference to the way memes proliferated through early online communities, including message boards, Usenet groups, and email. The emergence of social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram further diversified memes and accelerated their spread. Newer meme genres include ""dank"" and surrealist memes, as well as short-form videos popularized by platforms like Vine and TikTok.
Memes are now recognized as a significant aspect of Internet culture and are the subject of academic research. They appear across a broad spectrum of contexts, including marketing, economics, finance, politics, social movements, religion, and healthcare. While memes are often viewed as falling under fair use protection, their incorporation of material from pre-existing works can sometimes result in copyright disputes.


Characteristics
Internet memes derive from the original concept of ""memes"" as units of cultural transmission, passed from person to person. In the digital realm, this transmission occurs primarily through online platforms, such as social media. Although related, internet memes differ from traditional memes in that they often represent fleeting trends, whereas the success of traditional memes is measured by their endurance over time. Additionally, internet memes tend to be less abstract in nature compared to their traditional counterparts. They are highly versatile in form and purpose, serving as tools for light entertainment, self-expression, social commentary, and even political discourse.
Two fundamental characteristics of internet memes are creative reproduction and intertextuality. Creative reproduction refers to the adaptation and transformation of a meme through imitation or parody, either by reproducing the meme in a new context (""mimicry"") or by remixing the original material (""remix""). In mimicry, the meme is recreated in a different setting, as seen when different individuals replicate the viral video ""Charlie Bit My Finger"". Remix, on the other hand, involves technological manipulation, such as altering an image with Photoshop, while retaining elements of the original meme.
Intertextuality in memes involves the blending of different cultural references or contexts. An example of this is the combination of U.S. politician Mitt Romney's phrase ""binders full of women"" from the 2012 U.S. presidential debate with a scene from the Korean pop song ""Gangnam Style"". In this case, the phrase ""my binders full of women exploded"" is superimposed on a frame from Psy's music video, creating a new meaning by merging political and cultural references from distinct contexts.
Internet memes can also function as in-jokes within specific online communities, where they convey insider knowledge that may be incomprehensible to outsiders. This fosters a sense of collective identity within the group. Conversely, some memes achieve widespread cultural relevance, being understood and appreciated by broader audiences outside of the originating subculture.
A study by Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear examined how Richard Dawkins' three characteristics of successful traditional memes—fidelity, fecundity, and longevity—apply to internet memes. It was found that fidelity in the context of internet memes is better described as replicability, as memes are frequently modified through remixing while still maintaining their core message. Fecundity, or the ability of a meme to spread, is promoted by factors such as humor (such as the comically translated video game line ""All your base are belong to us""), intertextuality (as in the various pop culture-referencing renditions of the ""Star Wars Kid"" viral video), and juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous elements (exemplified in the ""Bert is Evil"" meme). Finally, longevity is essential for a meme's continued circulation and evolution over time.


Evolution and propagation

Internet memes can either remain consistent or evolve over time. This evolution may involve changes in meaning while retaining the meme’s structure, or vice versa, with such transformations occurring either by chance or through deliberate efforts like parody. A study by Miltner examined the lolcats meme, tracing its development from an in-joke within computer and gaming communities on the website 4chan to a broader source of humor and emotional support. As the meme entered mainstream culture, it lost favor with its original creators. Miltner explained that as content moves through different communities, it is reinterpreted to suit the specific needs and desires of those communities, often diverging from the creator’s original intent. Modifications to memes can lead them to transcend social and cultural boundaries.
Memes spread virally, in a manner similar to the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model used to describe the transmission of diseases. Once a meme has reached a critical number of individuals, its continued spread becomes inevitable. Research by Coscia examined the factors contributing to a meme’s propagation and longevity, concluding that while memes compete for attention—often resulting in shorter lifespans—they can also collaborate, enhancing their chances of survival. A meme that experiences an exceptionally high peak in popularity is unlikely to endure unless it is uniquely distinct. Conversely, a meme without such a peak, but that coexists with others, tends to have greater longevity. In 2013, Dominic Basulto, writing for The Washington Post, argued that the widespread use of memes, particularly by the marketing and advertising industries, has led to a decline in their original cultural value. Once considered valuable cultural artifacts meant to endure, memes now often convey trivial rather than meaningful ideas.


History


Origins and early memes

The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene as an attempt to explain how aspects of culture replicate, mutate, and evolve (memetics). Emoticons are among the earliest examples of internet memes, specifically the smiley emoticon "":-)"", introduced by Scott Fahlman in 1982. The concept of memes in an online context was formally proposed by Mike Godwin in the June 1993 issue of Wired. In 2013, Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection. Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a ""hijacking of the original idea"", evolving the very concept of a meme in this new direction. Nevertheless, by 2013, Limor Shifman solidified the relationship of memes to internet culture and reworked Dawkins' concept for online contexts. Such an association has been shown to be empirically valuable as internet memes carry an additional property that Dawkins' ""memes"" do not: internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.
However, before internet memes were considered truly academic, they were initially a colloquial reference to humorous visual communication online in the mid-late 1990s among internet denizens; examples of these early internet memes include the Dancing Baby and Hampster Dance. Memes of this time were primarily spread via messageboards, Usenet groups, and email, and generally lasted for a longer time than modern memes.

As the Internet protocols evolved, so did memes. Lolcats originated from imageboard website 4chan, becoming the prototype of the ""image macro"" format (an image overlaid by large text). Other early forms of image-based memes included demotivators (parodized motivational posters), photoshopped images, comics (such as rage comics), and anime fan art, sometimes made by doujin circles in various countries. After the release of YouTube in 2005, video-based memes such as Rickrolling and viral videos such as ""Gangnam Style"" and the Harlem shake emerged. The appearance of social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram provided additional mediums for the spread of memes, and the creation of meme-generating websites made their production more accessible.


Modern memes

""Dank memes"" are a more recent phenomenon, the phrase reaching mainstream prominence around 2014 and referring to deliberately zany or odd memes with features such as oversaturated colours, compression artifacts, crude humour, and overly loud sounds (termed ear rape). The term dank, which refers to cold, damp places, has been adapted as a way to describe memes as ""new"" or ""cool"". The term may also be used to describe memes that have become overused and stale to the point of paradoxically becoming humorous again. The phenomenon of dank memes sprouted a subculture called the ""meme market"", satirising Wall Street and applying the associated jargon (such as ""stocks"") to internet memes. Originally started on Reddit as /r/MemeEconomy, users jokingly ""buy"" or ""sell"" shares in a meme reflecting opinion on its potential popularity.

""Deep-fried"" memes refer to those that have been distorted and run through several filters and/or layers of lossy compression. An example of these is the ""E"" meme, a picture of YouTuber Markiplier photoshopped onto Lord Farquaad from the film Shrek, in turn photoshopped into a scene from businessman Mark Zuckerberg's hearing in Congress and captioned with a lone 'E'. Elizabeth Bruenig of the Washington Post described this as a ""digital update to the surreal and absurd genres of art and literature that characterized the tumultuous early 20th century"".
Many modern memes make use of humorously absurd and even surrealist themes. Examples of the former include ""they did surgery on a grape"", a video depicting a Da Vinci Surgical System performing test surgery on a grape, and the ""moth meme"", a close-up picture of a moth with captions humorously conveying the insect's love of lamps. Surreal memes incorporate layers of irony to make them unique and nonsensical, often as a means of escapism from mainstream meme culture.

After the success of the application Vine, a format of memes emerged in the form of short videos and scripted sketches. An example is the ""What's Nine Plus Ten?"" meme, a Vine video depicting a child humorously providing an incorrect answer to a math problem. After the shutdown of Vine in 2017, the de facto replacement became Chinese social network TikTok, which similarly utilises the short video format. The platform has become immensely popular, and is the source of memes such as the ""Renegade"" dance.
In 2022, the term brain rot became used to reflect a shift in how memes, particularly TikTok videos, were being interacted with. The term describes content lacking in quality and meaning, often associated with slang and trends popular among Generation Alpha, such as ""skibidi"", ""rizz"", ""gyatt"", and ""fanum tax"". The name comes from the perceived negative psychological and cognitive effects caused by exposure to such content.


By context


Marketing
The practice of using memes to market products or services has been termed ""memetic marketing"". Internet memes allow brands to circumvent the conception of advertisements as irksome, making them less overt and more tailored to the likes of their target audience. Marketing personnel may choose to utilise an existing meme, or create a new meme from scratch. Fashion house Gucci employed the former strategy, launching a series of Instagram ads that reimagined popular memes featuring its watch collection. The image macro ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" is an example of the latter, a meme generated from an advertising campaign for the Dos Equis beer brand. Products may also gain popularity through internet memes without intention by the producer themselves; for instance, the film Snakes on a Plane became a cult classic after creation of the website SnakesOnABlog.com by law student Brian Finkelstein.
Use of memes by brands, while often advantageous, has been subject to criticism for seemingly forced, unoriginal, or unfunny usage of memes, which can negatively impact a brand's image. For example, the fast food company Wendy's began a social media-based approach to marketing that was initially met with success (resulting in an almost 50% profit growth that year), but received criticism after sharing a controversial Pepe meme that was negatively perceived by consumers.


Economics and finance

Meme stocks are a phenomenon where stock values for a company rise significantly in a short period due to a surge in interest online and subsequent buying by investors. Video game retailer GameStop is recognised as the first meme stock. r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit where participants discuss stock trading, and Robinhood Markets, a financial services company, became notable in 2021 for their involvement in the popularisation of meme stocks. ""YOLO investors"" are a phenomenon that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, who are less risk averse in their investments compared to their traditional counterparts.
Additionally, memes have developed an association with cryptocurrency with the development of meme currencies such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Coin, and Pepe Coin. Meme cryptocurrencies have suggested comparisons between meme value and monetary markets.


Politics
Internet memes are a medium for fast communication to large online audiences, which has led to their use by those seeking to express a political opinion or actively campaign for (or against) a political entity. In some ways, they can be seen as a modern form of the political cartoon, offering a way to democratize political commentary.
Among the earliest political memes were those arising from the viral Dean scream, an excerpt from a speech delivered by Vermont governor Howard Dean. Over time, Internet memes have become an increasingly important element in political campaigns, as online communities contribute to broader discourse through the use of memes. For example, Ted Cruz's 2016 Republican presidential bid was damaged by a meme that jokingly speculated he was the Zodiac Killer.
Research has shown the use of memes during elections has a role to play in informing the public on political themes. A study explored this in relation to the 2017 UK general election, and concluded that memes acted as a widely shared conduit for basic political information to audiences who would usually not seek it out. They also found that memes may play some role in increasing voter turnout.
Some political campaigns have begun to explicitly taken advantage of the increasing influence of memes; as part of the 2020 US presidential campaign, Michael Bloomberg sponsored a number of Instagram accounts (with over 60 million followers collectively) to post memes related to the Bloomberg campaign. The campaign was faulted for treating memes as a commodity that can be bought.
Beyond their use in elections, Internet memes can become symbols for various political ideologies. A salient example is Pepe the Frog, which has been used as a symbol for the alt-right political movement, as well as for pro-democracy ideologies in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests.


Social movements

Internet memes can be powerful tools in social movements, constructing collective identity and providing platform for discourse. During the 2010 It Gets Better Project for LGBTQ+ empowerment, memes were used to uplift LGBTQ+ youth while negotiating the community's collective identity. In 2014, the viral Ice Bucket Challenge raised money and awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neurone Disease (ALS/MND). Furthermore, internet memes proved an important medium in the discourse surrounding the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement.


Religion
Internet memes have also been used in the context of religion. They create a participatory culture that enable individuals to collectively make meaning of religious beliefs, reflecting a form of lived religion. Aguilar et al. of Texas A&M University identified six common genres of religious memes: non-religious image macros with religious themes, image macros featuring religious figures, memes reacting to religion-related news, memes deifying non-religious figures such as celebrities, spoofs of religious images, and video-based memes.


Healthcare
Social media platforms can increase the speed of dissemination of evidence-based health practices. A study by Reynolds and Boyd found the majority of participants (who were healthcare staff) felt that memes could be an appropriate means of improving healthcare worker's knowledge of and compliance with infection prevention practices. Internet memes were also used in Nigeria to raise awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare professionals using the medium to disseminate information on the virus and its vaccine.


Copyright
Since many memes are derived from pre-existing works, it has been contended that memes violate the copyright of the original authors. However, some view memes as falling under the ambit of fair use in the United States. This dilemma has caused conflict between meme producers and copyright owners: for example, Getty Images' demand for payment from the blog Get Digital for publishing the ""Socially Awkward Penguin"" meme without permission.


United States
Under United States copyright law, copyright protection subsists in ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device"". It is disputed whether the use of memes constitutes copyright infringement.

Fair use is a defence under U.S. copyright law which protects work made using other copyrighted works. Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act outlines four factors for analysis of fair use:

The purpose and character of the use,
The nature of the copyrighted work,
The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and
The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The first factor implies the secondary use of a copyrighted work should be ""transformative"" (that is, giving novel meaning or expression to the original work); many memes fulfil this criterion, placing pieces of media in a new context to serve a different purpose to that of the original author. The second factor favours copied works drawing from factual sources, which may be problematic for memes derived from fictional works (such as films). Many of these memes, however, only use small portions of such works (such as still images), favouring an argument of fair use per the third factor. With regards to the fourth factor, most memes are non-commercial in nature and thus would not have adverse effects on the potential market for the copyright work. Given these factors, and the overall reliance of memes on appropriation of other sources, it has been argued that they deserve protection from copyright infringement suits.


Non-fungible tokens
Some individuals who are subjects of memes (and thus the copyright holders) have made money through sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in auctions. Ben Lashes, a manager of numerous memes, stated their sales as NFTs made over US$2 million and established memes as serious forms of art. One example is Disaster Girl, based on a photo of Zoe Roth at age 4 taken in Mebane, North Carolina, in January 2005. After this photo became famous and was used hundreds of times without permission, Roth decided to sell the original copy as an NFT for US$539,973 (equivalent to $626,576 in 2024), with an agreement for a further 10 percent share of any future sales.

It was noted that memes are cultural items that spread primarily through social media platforms in formats like images, videos, and GIFs. The term 'meme' was introduced by Richard Dawkins in 1972, while 'Internet meme' was coined by Mike Godwin in 1993. Memes are recognized for their viral dissemination, creative reproduction, intertextuality, and continual evolution. They serve multiple purposes including entertainment, self-expression, social commentary, and political discourse. The team discussed how memes can function as in-jokes within specific communities or achieve widespread cultural relevance. Research highlighted the application of Dawkins' characteristics of successful traditional memes—fidelity (replicability), fecundity (spread), and longevity—to internet memes. The evolution of memes involves changes in meaning or structure through parody or remixing. Memes spread virally similar to disease transmission models; factors contributing to propagation include humor and intertextuality. Historical context covered early examples like emoticons and modern phenomena such as 'dank' and surrealist memes. Memes have significant roles in marketing, economics (e.g., meme stocks), politics (e.g., election campaigns), social movements (e.g., LGBTQ+ empowerment), religion, healthcare awareness, and copyright issues under U.S. law regarding fair use protection. Additionally, the sale of meme-related NFTs has emerged as a new trend.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants, setting the tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick acknowledgment of familiarity\n- Outline meeting objectives"", ""Scene 2: Introduction to Memes\nTLDR: Overview of internet memes and their significance.\n- Definition and history of memes\n- Characteristics and impact on culture"", ""Scene 3: Evolution and Spread of Memes\nTLDR: Discuss how memes evolve and spread virally.\n- Factors contributing to meme propagation\n- Examples of viral memes"", ""Scene 4: Memes in Various Contexts\nTLDR: Explore the role of memes in different sectors.\n- Marketing strategies using memes\n- Political discourse and social movements"", ""Scene 5: Research Insights on Memetics\nTLDR: Present academic perspectives on memetics.\n- Dawkins' characteristics applied to internet memes\n- Data-driven analysis of meme trends"", ""Scene 6: Spontaneous Discussion on Meme Trends\nTLDR: Open floor for spontaneous contributions about current meme trends.\n- Participants share personal experiences with viral content\n- Debate on the future direction of meme culture"", ""Scene 7: Decision-Making Process\nTLDR: Evaluate options, weigh pros and cons, reach consensus or decision.\n- Summarize key points discussed\n- Deliberate on potential actions or decisions"", ""Scene 8: Assigning Responsibilities and Action Items\nTLDR: Finalize decision, assign tasks, outline next steps.\n- Allocate responsibilities among participants\n- Set deadlines for action items"", ""Scene 9: Closing Remarks and Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Wrap up meeting with closing remarks; allow brief off-topic conversation.\n- Recap decisions made and action items assigned\n- Casual chat to end on a light note""]",">>Digital Communication Specialist: Hey everyone, great to see you all! Let's kick things off by outlining our objectives for today. We're here to discuss effective messaging strategies and how we can optimize our digital interactions.
>>Social Media Strategist: Absolutely, it's awesome to have everyone here. So, let's dive into how we can make our content go viral and really engage our audience.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Memes are a great tool because they simplify complicated concepts and connect with people quickly. They act as modern folklore, bridging gaps between diverse communities online.
>>Social Media Strategist: Yeah, memes can really make content pop and engage audiences in ways traditional methods can't. But what about other forms of content? How do videos or influencer partnerships fit into our strategy?
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Good point! Videos are incredibly engaging and can tell a story more effectively than text alone. Influencer partnerships also help us reach new audiences through trusted voices.
>>Memetics Expert: Right, while memes are powerful, we shouldn't rely on them exclusively. Videos offer dynamic storytelling opportunities, and influencers bring authenticity to our brand.
>>Social Media Strategist: Exactly! We need a balanced approach that includes various types of content. What about SEO optimization? How can we ensure our messages reach the right people?
>>Internet Culture Researcher: SEO is crucial for visibility. By optimizing keywords and creating high-quality content, we can improve search rankings and attract organic traffic.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: And let's not forget about engagement metrics. Tracking likes, shares, comments, and overall interaction helps us understand what's working and where we need to adjust.
>>Memetics Expert: Absolutely! It's all about finding the right mix of strategies that resonate with our audience. Whether it's memes, videos, or influencer collaborations—each has its place in a comprehensive digital marketing plan. 
 >>Internet Culture Researcher: Memes have really evolved from simple emoticons to complex forms of expression that mix humor with social commentary. They reflect and shape public discourse in ways traditional media often can't.
>>Social Media Strategist: Exactly! Memes can turn a simple message into something memorable that spreads quickly. It's great for brands looking to go viral.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Yeah, they break down complex ideas into easy-to-understand formats that resonate across cultures. It's amazing how they can start conversations and even drive movements.
>>Memetics Expert: True, but we need to be careful not to overuse them in marketing campaigns. It can lead to audience fatigue or backlash if done too much.
>>Social Media Strategist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—do you think there's a risk of overusing memes?
>>Memetics Expert: That's a great point! Yes, there is definitely a risk if not done thoughtfully. Overuse can lead to fatigue or even backlash from audiences who feel bombarded by repetitive content.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Absolutely! And when used right, they can transcend cultural barriers and act as universal symbols understood globally. Their intertextuality allows them to blend various cultural references, creating new meanings and fostering a sense of collective identity within digital communities.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: So yeah, memes are incredibly versatile. They can be used to convey humor, social commentary, or even political messages. It's fascinating how they evolve and adapt to different contexts and audiences. 
 >>Internet Culture Researcher: The viral spread of memes can be likened to the SIR model used in epidemiology. Once a meme reaches a critical mass, its propagation becomes almost inevitable. For instance, consider the 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme; it started as a stock photo and evolved into countless variations across different contexts.

>>Social Media Strategist: Yeah, exactly! Memes like 'Grumpy Cat' and 'Success Kid' are perfect examples of how a simple image can evolve into various contexts and spread like wildfire. It's all about engaging your audience with relatable content!

>>Digital Communication Specialist: Well, another great example is the 'Woman Yelling at a Cat' meme. It started as two separate images and evolved into a hilarious combination that resonated with many people. It's amazing how these memes can convey complex emotions and situations so effectively!

>>Internet Culture Researcher: Moreover, the 'Grumpy Cat' meme shows how different cultural references come together to create something new. It seamlessly integrates various elements, making it adaptable to different contexts and audiences.

>>Memetics Expert: You know, memes are like cultural viruses. They spread through social media platforms and evolve as they get shared. Take the 'Bad Luck Brian' meme; it started as a funny yearbook photo but became popular because people kept remixing it to fit different situations.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: So yeah, memes like 'Woman Yelling at a Cat' really show how effective messaging can transcend cultural boundaries. They capture complex emotions in such a relatable way that people can't help but share them.

>>Internet Culture Researcher: And speaking of adaptability, the 'Success Kid' meme illustrates how these images can resonate across different communities while maintaining their core message.

>>Social Media Strategist: Right! And remember the 'Bad Luck Brian'? That one took an awkward school photo and turned it into this hilarious context that resonated with so many people on Reddit and Twitter.

>>Memetics Expert: Exactly! Memes are like cultural chameleons; they adapt to different contexts while keeping their core message intact. I mean, just look at the versatility of these memes on platforms like TikTok; it's fascinating how they transcend boundaries and resonate with diverse audiences.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: Hmm... The versatility of these memes really highlights their power in digital communication. They capture universal experiences in simple yet impactful ways. 
 >>Memetics Expert: Well, memes are like cultural snapshots; they capture moments and spread them far and wide. It's amazing how they rally people around a cause or idea.
>>Social Media Strategist: Absolutely! Memes make content relatable and shareable—key for going viral. Remember that campaign last year? It went viral because of those clever memes we used!
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Right! In politics, memes quickly mobilize support by simplifying complex ideologies into shareable formats that resonate widely.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: And they're so adaptable! Whether it's social movements or marketing campaigns, memes transmit ideas across cultures effectively.
>>Memetics Expert: Exactly! They fit different contexts perfectly—like when we saw them used in that environmental campaign recently. They really brought attention to the issue!
>>Social Media Strategist: Totally! Memes cut through the noise better than traditional ads ever could. 
 >>Memetics Expert: You know, memes are like cultural snapshots that evolve over time. Dawkins' idea of fidelity, fecundity, and longevity really applies here. Memes replicate and spread rapidly, but they also adapt to fit new contexts. It's amazing how quickly these ideas spread!
>>Internet Culture Researcher: That's a great point! And what's interesting is how memes maintain their core message while being remixed or parodied. This creative reproduction enhances their replicability. For example, think about the ""Distracted Boyfriend"" meme—it's been used in so many different ways but always keeps that recognizable format.
>>Social Media Strategist: Yeah, exactly! Memes are like the secret sauce in digital marketing because they make content relatable and shareable. Remember when we used the ""Success Kid"" meme for our campaign last year? It really resonated with people and boosted engagement.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Right! Memes aren't just about humor; they can be powerful tools for effective messaging. By tapping into cultural references and emotions, we can create content that resonates deeply with our audience.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Indeed! In digital culture, memes aren't just fleeting trends but dynamic entities evolving through creative reproduction and intertextuality. This adaptability allows them to transcend social and cultural boundaries.
>>Memetics Expert: Exactly! And you know what's fascinating? The way memes adapt across different contexts—it's like they're constantly evolving to stay relevant.
>>Social Media Strategist: Totally agree! When it comes to marketing campaigns, memes can cut through the noise better than traditional ads. They have this unique ability to connect on a personal level.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Absolutely! By leveraging the emotional appeal of memes, we can optimize our communication strategies effectively. Have you seen how brands use the ""Woman Yelling at a Cat"" meme? It's hilarious but also incredibly engaging. 
 >>Social Media Strategist: You know, speaking of engaging memes, have you guys noticed the rise of TikTok trends like 'Renegade' dance? It's pretty cool how these short videos can go viral so quickly and create such strong emotional responses. I mean, it's fascinating how these trends can capture attention and spark conversations.

>>Internet Culture Researcher: Yeah, the 'Renegade' dance is a great example of how quickly things can blow up on TikTok. These short videos really act as snapshots of what's trending at the moment. It's interesting to see how they resonate with people.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: Have you seen the 'Skibidi Toilet' meme? It's everywhere! It's funny how something so absurd can capture such widespread attention. Digital interactions are key!

>>Memetics Expert: Totally! The 'Skibidi Toilet' meme shows just how powerful humor and absurdity can be in capturing people's interest. Memes really are the DNA of culture!

>>Social Media Strategist: Speaking of viral trends, have you guys seen the 'NPC' meme trend? It's hilarious how people mimic non-playable characters from video games in real life. It’s almost like we’re all part of some giant simulation!

>>Internet Culture Researcher: That's an interesting point! The 'NPC' meme trend definitely taps into our fascination with simulation theory and online personas. It blurs the lines between virtual and real-life interactions.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: Yeah, it’s almost like we’re living in a video game sometimes! These digital interactions really highlight that.

>>Memetics Expert: Exactly! The ‘NPC’ meme trend reflects our obsession with simulation theory while also showing performative aspects of online personas.

>>Social Media Strategist: By the way, have you guys noticed the resurgence in ‘Doge’ memes? It’s amazing how this old meme is making a comeback with new variations. I mean, it’s like memes never really die; they just evolve!

>>Internet Culture Researcher: Indeed! The resurgence of ‘Doge’ shows that some memes have staying power and can come back in new forms over time. It highlights the cyclical nature of internet culture.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: So true! Seeing ‘Doge’ make a comeback reminds me that old memes don’t die; they evolve into new contexts while keeping their original charm intact. 
 >>Memetics Expert: Well, memes are like cultural snapshots that evolve over time. They adapt to new contexts while keeping their core message intact. It's fascinating how they can cross different groups and cultures.
>>Social Media Strategist: So, we've discussed the pros and cons of using memes extensively. I think we should consider diversifying our content strategy to include more videos and influencer partnerships. This way, we can keep our audience engaged without overwhelming them with memes. What do you all think?
>>Internet Culture Researcher: While memes are indeed powerful tools for engagement, we must also consider their potential for audience fatigue. Overuse can lead to diminishing returns and even backlash. Let's dive into the data from past campaigns to identify the best places to use them.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Diversifying our content strategy is a great idea. Videos and influencer partnerships can definitely keep the audience engaged without overwhelming them with memes.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Moreover, considering the data from past campaigns—
>>Memetics Expert (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—do we have any specific examples where meme fatigue was evident? It might help us understand better.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Good point! Yes, there were a few instances in last year's campaign where engagement dropped significantly after repeated meme usage. We can look at those cases closely.
>>Social Media Strategist: Right! Maybe we could focus on short-form videos or collaborate with influencers who align well with our brand values.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: That's a good idea! And perhaps we could also experiment with live streams or behind-the-scenes content to keep things fresh.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Indeed! To summarize, it sounds like we're all on board with mixing things up by incorporating videos and influencer partnerships alongside memes. Let's check our past data to see where this worked best. 
 >>Digital Communication Specialist: I'll take charge of monitoring engagement metrics and analyzing past campaign data to refine our strategies. This will help us identify which types of content resonate most with our audience.

>>Social Media Strategist: Great, I'll focus on creating viral content that engages our audience. Let's make this go viral! How about we set a deadline for the first batch of content? Two weeks from now?

>>Internet Culture Researcher: Two weeks sounds reasonable. Additionally, I'll ensure our meme usage is backed by data analysis to avoid audience fatigue.

>>Memetics Expert: Good point about avoiding fatigue. We also need to understand the cultural impact behind these memes. Memes are not just numbers; they reflect what's happening in society right now.

>>Digital Communication Specialist: Got it! So, two weeks for the first batch then? That should give us enough time to analyze engagement metrics effectively. Let's start outlining specific tasks for each team member. 
 >>Social Media Strategist: Well, it looks like we've got everything covered. Let's make this go viral! Anyone have any good meme recommendations? I saw a hilarious one yesterday!
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Actually, we've covered the essential elements of our strategy. Let's dive into the data to make sure we're on track and avoid boring our audience.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: So, we've got our balanced content strategy and the deadline for the first batch of viral content set. We should keep an eye on how these trends perform across different platforms. Um, any thoughts on how we can leverage trending memes without overwhelming our audience?
>>Memetics Expert: (interrupts) Sorry to interrupt, but just a quick thought—shouldn't we also consider seasonal trends? Like Halloween memes since it's coming up soon? Imagine a pumpkin doing TikTok dances!
>>Social Media Strategist: Great point! Seasonal trends could definitely boost engagement. We should look into that while planning.
>>Internet Culture Researcher: Absolutely! Seasonal trends are crucial, but let's not overdo it. We need balance and also analyze their impact on different demographics.
>>Digital Communication Specialist: Right, we'll need to keep an eye on how these trends perform across various platforms too. Okay, I think we're all set with our action items and deadlines."
