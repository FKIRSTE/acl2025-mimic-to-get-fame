Macroeconomics,"Heterodox

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that deals with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole.[1] This includes regional, national, and global economies.[2][3] Macroeconomists study topics such as output/GDP (gross domestic product) and national income, unemployment (including unemployment rates), price indices and inflation, consumption, saving, investment, energy, international trade, and international finance.

Macroeconomics and microeconomics are the two most general fields in economics.[4] The focus of macroeconomics is often on a country (or larger entities like the whole world) and how its markets interact to produce large-scale phenomena that economists refer to as aggregate variables. In microeconomics the focus of analysis is often a single market, such as whether changes in supply or demand are to blame for price increases in the oil and automotive sectors. 
From introductory classes in ""principles of economics"" through doctoral studies, the macro/micro divide is institutionalized in the field of economics. Most economists identify as either macro- or micro-economists.

Macroeconomics is traditionally divided into topics along different time frames: the analysis of short-term fluctuations over the business cycle, the determination of structural levels of variables like inflation and unemployment in the medium (i.e. unaffected by short-term deviations) term, and the study of long-term economic growth. It also studies the consequences of policies targeted at mitigating fluctuations like fiscal or monetary policy, using taxation and government expenditure or interest rates, respectively, and of policies that can affect living standards in the long term, e.g. by affecting growth rates.

Macroeconomics as a separate field of research and study is generally recognized to start in 1936, when John Maynard Keynes published his The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, but its intellectual predecessors are much older. Since World War II, various macroeconomic schools of thought like Keynesians, monetarists, new classical and new Keynesian economists have made contributions to the development of the macroeconomic research mainstream.

Macroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but above all the three central macroeconomic variables are output, unemployment, and inflation.[5]: 39  Besides, the time horizon varies for different types of macroeconomic topics, and this distinction is crucial for many research and policy debates.[5]: 54  A further important dimension is that of an economy's openness, economic theory distinguishing sharply between closed economies and open economies.[5]: 373 

It is usual to distinguish between three time horizons in macroeconomics, each having its own focus on e.g. the determination of output:[5]: 54 

National output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given period of time. Everything that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income. The total net output of the economy is usually measured as gross domestic product (GDP). Adding net factor incomes from abroad to GDP produces gross national income (GNI), which measures total income of all residents in the economy. In most countries, the difference between GDP and GNI are modest so that GDP can approximately be treated as total income of all the inhabitants as well, but in some countries, e.g. countries with very large net foreign assets (or debt), the difference may be considerable.[5]: 385 

Economists interested in long-run increases in output study economic growth. Advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital, and better education and human capital, are all factors that lead to increased economic output over time. However, output does not always increase consistently over time. Business cycles can cause short-term drops in output called recessions. Economists look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping into either recessions or overheating and that lead to higher productivity levels and standards of living.

The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e. the percentage of persons in the labor force who do not have a job, but who are actively looking for one. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are not part of the labor force and consequently not counted as unemployed, either.[5]: 156 

Unemployment has a short-run cyclical component which depends on the business cycle, and a more permanent structural component, which can be loosely thought of as the average unemployment rate in an economy over extended periods,[6] and which is often termed the natural[6] or structural[7][5]: 167  rate of unemployment.

Cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. Okun's law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and short-run GDP growth.[8] The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.[9]

The structural or natural rate of unemployment is the level of unemployment that will occur in a medium-run equilibrium, i.e. a situation with a cyclical unemployment rate of zero. There may be several reasons why there is some positive unemployment level even in a cyclically neutral situation, which all have their foundation in some kind of market failure:[6]

A general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation. When prices decrease, there is deflation. Economists measure these changes in prices with price indexes. Inflation will increase when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly. Similarly, a declining economy can lead to decreasing inflation and even in some cases deflation.

Central bankers conducting monetary policy usually have as a main priority to avoid too high inflation, typically by adjusting interest rates. High inflation as well as deflation can lead to increased uncertainty and other negative consequences, in particular when the inflation (or deflation) is unexpected. Consequently, most central banks aim for a positive, but stable and not very high inflation level.[5]

Changes in the inflation level may be the result of several factors. Too much aggregate demand in the economy will cause an overheating, raising inflation rates via the Phillips curve because of a tight labor market leading to large wage increases which will be transmitted to increases in the price of the products of employers. Too little aggregate demand will have the opposite effect of creating more unemployment and lower wages, thereby decreasing inflation. Aggregate supply shocks will also affect inflation, e.g. the oil crises of the 1970s and the 2021–2023 global energy crisis. Changes in inflation may also impact the formation of inflation expectations, creating a self-fulfilling inflationary or deflationary spiral.[5]

The monetarist quantity theory of money holds that changes in the price level are directly caused by changes in the money supply.[16] Whereas there is empirical evidence that there is a long-run positive correlation between the growth rate of the money stock and the rate of inflation, the quantity theory has proved unreliable in the short- and medium-run time horizon relevant to monetary policy and is abandoned as a practical guideline by most central banks today.[17]

Open economy macroeconomics deals with the consequences of international trade in goods, financial assets and possibly factor markets like labor migration and international relocation of firms (physical capital). It explores what determines import, export, the balance of trade and over longer horizons the accumulation of net foreign assets. An important topic is the role of exchange rates and the pros and cons of maintaining a fixed exchange rate system or even a currency union like the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, drawing on the research literature on optimum currency areas.[5]

One way to calculate Gross Domestic Product, or total net output, is the expenditure method. The GDP essentially tells you how big the economy is. The larger the GDP value, the bigger the economy. The expenditure approach involves looking at four main components: Consumer Spending, Government Spending, Investment Spending, and Net Exports.[18] Consumer Spending is made up of ordinary consumers spending money on different kinds of products and also investing their money in residential markets. Government Spending involves the government spending money on goods and services and they may assist consumers or businesses with spending as well. For instance, purchasing physical capital for businesses. While transfer payments, which includes things like welfare or social security payments), are things that a government pays, it is not included in the final calculation of the expenditure approach because it is not paying for any final goods and services. Investment spending involves businesses spending money on physical capital/equipment to help with producing goods and services. Lastly, net exports is just exports minus imports. Exports are goods and services that a country is selling to people abroad and imports are goods and services that people from a country are receiving from abroad.

Hence, the equation for the expenditure approach to calculating the Gross Domestic Product is

GDP = Consumer Spending(CS) + Government Spending(GS) + Investment Spending(IS) + Net Exports(EXP-IMP).

Another concern with measuring a country's economic growth is that even though we see the GDP growing, that does not inherently mean the economy is growing. Most of the increase in GDP may just be due to inflation. To know whether this is the case, we have to calculate the GDP Deflator which adjusts the GDP for inflation.

GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP/Real GDP) x 100[19]

Nominal GDP is GDP that includes inflation and Real GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation. To adjust for inflation means that the effect of inflation on the value was removed.

A GDP Deflator of 100 indicates that there is no inflation nor deflation. A GDP Deflator value that is greater than 100 indicates that there is inflation. A GDP Deflator value that is less than 100 indicates that there is deflation.

Two common ways of determining the total money supply in an economy are M1 and M2. M2 consists of M1 plus a few other things. M1 is money that is liquid. Liquid refers to a financial asset being able to easily be converted into cash quickly and without losing a significant amount of value. This obviously includes cash but also things like coins, checking account deposits, etc. M2, however, includes time deposits, saving accounts, and money market mutual funds, which are not as liquid, in its measurement. It is important to know about the money supply as it affects interest rates and can also play a central role in monetary policy.[20]

The Money Multiplier equation shows how the bank can expand the money supply through taking in deposits and lending money.

The Money Supply Reserve Multiplier equation is:

Money Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Requirement Ratio[21]

The reserve requirement in this equation represents a proportion of money that the bank is required to keep in case they need to deal with withdrawals from customers. That proportion of money is based on the deposits of money made at the bank. So, if the reserve requirement is .20(20%), then the money multiplier is 5. This means that a $5 deposit would lead to a $25 increase in the money supply. This is because of the cycle of the bank keeping part of the deposit(in our example, 20%) and lending out the rest every time. These new spendable bank deposits are counted in the money supply even though the amount of physical currency did not change. So, while the physical amount of currency would still be $5, the amount of spendable money would be $25.

Macroeconomics as a separate field of research and study is generally recognized to start with the publication of John Maynard Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money in 1936.[22][23][5]: 526  The terms ""macrodynamics"" and ""macroanalysis"" were introduced by Ragnar Frisch in 1933, and Lawrence Klein in 1946 used the word ""macroeconomics"" itself in a journal title in 1946.[22] but naturally several of the themes which are central to macroeconomic research had been discussed by thoughtful economists and other writers long before 1936.[22]

In particular, macroeconomic questions before Keynes were the topic of the two long-standing traditions of business cycle theory and monetary theory. William Stanley Jevons was one of the pioneers of the first tradition, whereas the quantity theory of money, labelled the oldest surviving theory in economics, as an example of the second was described already in the 16th century by Martín de Azpilcueta and later discussed by personalities like John Locke and David Hume. In the first decades of the 20th century monetary theory was dominated by the eminent economists Alfred Marshall, Knut Wicksell and Irving Fisher.[22]

When the Great Depression struck, the reigning economists had difficulty explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed. In the prevailing neoclassical economics paradigm, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold. Keynes in his main work, the General Theory, initiated what is known as the Keynesian Revolution. He offered a new interpretation of events and a whole intellectural framework - a novel theory of economics that explained why markets might not clear, which would evolve into a school of thought known as Keynesian economics, also called Keynesianism or Keynesian theory.[5]: 526 

In Keynes' theory, aggregate demand - by Keynes called ""effective demand"" - was key to determining output. Even if Keynes conceded that output might eventually return to a medium-run equilibrium (or ""potential"") level, the process would be slow at best. Keynes coined the term liquidity preference (his preferred name for what is also known as money demand) and explained how monetary policy might affect aggregate demand, at the same time offering clear policy recommendations for an active role of fiscal policy in stabilizing aggregate demand and hence output and employment. In addition, he explained how the multiplier effect would magnify a small decrease in consumption or investment and cause declines throughout the economy, and noted the role that uncertainty and animal spirits can play in the economy.[5]: 526 

The generation following Keynes combined the macroeconomics of the General Theory with neoclassical microeconomics to create the neoclassical synthesis. By the 1950s, most economists had accepted the synthesis view of the macroeconomy.[5]: 526  Economists like Paul Samuelson, Franco Modigliani, James Tobin, and Robert Solow developed formal Keynesian models and contributed formal theories of consumption, investment, and money demand that fleshed out the Keynesian framework.[5]: 527 

Milton Friedman updated the quantity theory of money to include a role for money demand. He argued that the role of money in the economy was sufficient to explain the Great Depression, and that aggregate demand oriented explanations were not necessary. Friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, Friedman doubted the government's ability to ""fine-tune"" the economy with monetary policy. He generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.[5]: 528 

Friedman also challenged the original simple Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment. Friedman and Edmund Phelps (who was not a monetarist) proposed an ""augmented"" version of the Phillips curve that excluded the possibility of a stable, long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.[24] When the oil shocks of the 1970s created a high unemployment and high inflation, Friedman and Phelps were vindicated. Monetarism was particularly influential in the early 1980s, but fell out of favor when central banks found the results disappointing when trying to target money supply instead of interest rates as monetarists recommended, concluding that the relationships between money growth, inflation and real GDP growth are too unstable to be useful in practical monetary policy making.[25]

New classical macroeconomics further challenged the Keynesian school. A central development in new classical thought came when Robert Lucas introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Prior to Lucas, economists had generally used adaptive expectations where agents were assumed to look at the recent past to make expectations about the future. Under rational expectations, agents are assumed to be more sophisticated.[5]: 530  Consumers will not simply assume a 2% inflation rate just because that has been the average the past few years; they will look at current monetary policy and economic conditions to make an informed forecast. In the new classical models with rational expectations, monetary policy only had a limited impact.

Lucas also made an influential critique of Keynesian empirical models. He argued that forecasting models based on empirical relationships would keep producing the same predictions even as the underlying model generating the data changed. He advocated models based on fundamental economic theory (i.e. having an explicit microeconomic foundation) that would, in principle, be structurally accurate as economies changed.[5]: 530 

Following Lucas's critique, new classical economists, led by Edward C. Prescott and Finn E. Kydland, created real business cycle (RBC) models of the macro economy. RBC models were created by combining fundamental equations from neo-classical microeconomics to make quantitative models. In order to generate macroeconomic fluctuations, RBC models explained recessions and unemployment with changes in technology instead of changes in the markets for goods or money. Critics of RBC models argue that technological changes, which typically diffuse slowly throughout the economy, could hardly generate the large short-run output fluctuations that we observe. In addition, there is strong empirical evidence that monetary policy does affect real economic activity, and the idea that technological regress can explain recent recessions seems implausible.[5]: 533 [6]: 195 

Despite criticism of the realism in the RBC models, they have been very influential in economic methodology by providing the first examples of general equilibrium models based on microeconomic foundations and a specification of underlying shocks that aim to explain the main features of macroeconomic fluctuations, not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively. In this way, they were forerunners of the later DSGE models.[6]: 194 

New Keynesian economists responded to the new classical school by adopting rational expectations and focusing on developing micro-founded models that were immune to the Lucas critique. Like classical models, new classical models had assumed that prices would be able to adjust perfectly and monetary policy would only lead to price changes. New Keynesian models investigated sources of sticky prices and wages due to imperfect competition,[26] which would not adjust, allowing monetary policy to impact quantities instead of prices. Stanley Fischer and John B. Taylor produced early work in this area by showing that monetary policy could be effective even in models with rational expectations when contracts locked in wages for workers. Other new Keynesian economists, including Olivier Blanchard, Janet Yellen, Julio Rotemberg, Greg Mankiw, David Romer, and Michael Woodford, expanded on this work and demonstrated other cases where various market imperfections caused inflexible prices and wages leading in turn to monetary and fiscal policy having real effects. Other researchers focused on imperferctions in labor markets, developing models of efficiency wages or search and matching (SAM) models, or imperfections in credit markets like Ben Bernanke.[5]: 532–36 

By the late 1990s, economists had reached a rough consensus.[27] The market imperfections and nominal rigidities of new Keynesian theory was combined with rational expectations and the RBC methodology to produce a new and popular type of models called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The fusion of elements from different schools of thought has been dubbed the new neoclassical synthesis.[28][29] These models are now used by many central banks and are a core part of contemporary macroeconomics.[5]: 535–36 

The 2008 financial crisis, which led to the Great Recession, led to major reassessment of macroeconomics, which as a field generally had neglected the potential role of financial institutions in the economy. After the crisis, macroeconomic researchers have turned their attention in several new directions:

Research in the economics of the determinants behind long-run economic growth has followed its own course.[34] The Harrod-Domar model from the 1940s attempted to build a long-run growth model inspired by Keynesian demand-driven considerations.[35] The Solow–Swan model worked out by Robert Solow and, independently, Trevor Swan in the 1950s achieved more long-lasting success, however, and is still today a common textbook model for explaining economic growth in the long-run.[36] The model operates with a production function where national output is the product of two inputs: capital and labor. The Solow model assumes that labor and capital are used at constant rates without the fluctuations in unemployment and capital utilization commonly seen in business cycles.[37] In this model, increases in output, i.e. economic growth, can only occur because of an increase in the capital stock, a larger population, or technological advancements that lead to higher productivity (total factor productivity). An increase in the savings rate leads to a temporary increase as the economy creates more capital, which adds to output. However, eventually the depreciation rate will limit the expansion of capital: savings will be used up replacing depreciated capital, and no savings will remain to pay for an additional expansion in capital. Solow's model suggests that economic growth in terms of output per capita depends solely on technological advances that enhance productivity.[38] The Solow model can be interpreted as a special case of the more general Ramsey growth model, where households' savings rates are not constant as in the Solow model, but derived from an explicit intertemporal utility function.

In the 1980s and 1990s endogenous growth theory arose to challenge the neoclassical growth theory of Ramsey and Solow. This group of models explains economic growth through factors such as increasing returns to scale for capital and learning-by-doing that are endogenously determined instead of the exogenous technological improvement used to explain growth in Solow's model.[39] Another type of endogenous growth models endogenized the process of technological progress by modelling research and development activities by profit-maximizing firms explicitly within the growth models themselves.[7]: 280–308 

Since the 1970s, various environmental problems have been integrated into growth and other macroeconomic models to study their implications more thoroughly. During the oil crises of the 1970s when scarcity problems of natural resources were high on the public agenda, economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Solow introduced non-renewable resources into neoclassical growth models to study the possibilities of maintaining growth in living standards under these conditions.[7]: 201–39  More recently, the issue of climate change and the possibilities of a sustainable development are examined in so-called integrated assessment models, pioneered by William Nordhaus.[40] In macroeconomic models in environmental economics, the economic system is dependant upon the environment. In this case, the circular flow of income diagram may be replaced by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an ""environment's source function"", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The ""sink function"" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.[41]: 8   In 2024 a new approach was proposed which would institutionalize Inclusion, Sustainability and Resilience in Domestic Economic Governance.[42]

The division into various time frames of macroeconomic research leads to a parallel division of macroeconomic policies into short-run policies aimed at mitigating the harmful consequences of business cycles (known as stabilization policy) and medium- and long-run policies targeted at improving the structural levels of macroeconomic variables.[7]: 18 

Stabilization policy is usually implemented through two sets of tools: fiscal and monetary policy. Both forms of policy are used to stabilize the economy, i.e. limiting the effects of the business cycle by conducting expansive policy when the economy is in a recession or contractive policy in the case of overheating.[5][43]

Structural policies may be labor market policies which aim to change the structural unemployment rate or policies which affect long-run propensities to save, invest, or engage in education or research and development.[7]: 19 

Central banks conduct monetary policy mainly by adjusting short-term interest rates.[44] The actual method through which the interest rate is changed differs from central bank to central bank, but typically the implementation happens either directly via administratively changing the central bank's own offered interest rates or indirectly via open market operations.[45]

Via the monetary transmission mechanism, interest rate changes affect investment, consumption, asset prices like stock prices and house prices, and through exchange rate reactions export and import. In this way aggregate demand, employment and ultimately inflation is affected.[46] Expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, increasing economic activity, whereas contractionary monetary policy raises interest rates. In the case of a fixed exchange rate system, interest rate decisions together with direct intervention by central banks on exchange rate dynamics are major tools to control the exchange rate.[47]

In developed countries, most central banks follow inflation targeting, focusing on keeping medium-term inflation close to an explicit target, say 2%, or within an explicit range. This includes the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are generally considered to follow a strategy very close to inflation targeting, even though they do not officially label themselves as inflation targeters.[48] In practice, an official inflation targeting often leaves room for the central bank to also help stabilize output and employment, a strategy known as ""flexible inflation targeting"".[49] Most emerging economies focus their monetary policy on maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime, aligning their currency with one or more foreign currencies, typically the US dollar or the euro.[50]

Conventional monetary policy can be ineffective in situations such as a liquidity trap. When nominal interest rates are near zero, central banks cannot loosen monetary policy through conventional means. In that situation, they may use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing to help stabilize output. Quantity easing can be implemented by buying not only government bonds, but also other assets such as corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. This allows lower interest rates for a broader class of assets beyond government bonds. A similar strategy is to lower long-term interest rates by buying long-term bonds and selling short-term bonds to create a flat yield curve, known in the US as Operation Twist.[51]

Fiscal policy is the use of government's revenue (taxes) and expenditure as instruments to influence the economy.

For example, if the economy is producing less than potential output, government spending can be used to employ idle resources and boost output, or taxes could be lowered to boost private consumption which has a similar effect. Government spending or tax cuts do not have to make up for the entire output gap. There is a multiplier effect that affects the impact of government spending. For instance, when the government pays for a bridge, the project not only adds the value of the bridge to output, but also allows the bridge workers to increase their consumption and investment, which helps to close the output gap.

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by partial or full crowding out. When the government takes on spending projects, it limits the amount of resources available for the private sector to use. Full crowding out occurs in the extreme case when government spending simply replaces private sector output instead of adding additional output to the economy. A crowding out effect may also occur if government spending should lead to higher interest rates, which would limit investment.[52]

Some fiscal policy is implemented through automatic stabilizers without any active decisions by politicians. Automatic stabilizers do not suffer from the policy lags of discretionary fiscal policy. Automatic stabilizers use conventional fiscal mechanisms, but take effect as soon as the economy takes a downturn: spending on unemployment benefits automatically increases when unemployment rises, and tax revenues decrease, which shelters private income and consumption from part of the fall in market income.[7]: 657 

There is a general consensus that both monetary and fiscal instruments may affect demand and activity in the short run (i.e. over the business cycle).[7]: 657  Economists usually favor monetary over fiscal policy to mitigate moderate fluctuations, however, because it has two major advantages. First, monetary policy is generally implemented by independent central banks instead of the political institutions that control fiscal policy. Independent central banks are less likely to be subject to political pressures for overly expansionary policies. Second, monetary policy may suffer shorter inside lags and outside lags than fiscal policy.[43] There are some exceptions, however: Firstly, in the case of a major shock, monetary stabilization policy may not be sufficient and should be supplemented by active fiscal stabilization.[7]: 659  Secondly, in the case of a very low interest level, the economy may be in a liquidity trap in which monetary policy becomes ineffective, which makes fiscal policy the more potent tool to stabilize the economy.[5] Thirdly, in regimes where monetary policy is tied to fulfilling other targets, in particular fixed exchange rate regimes, the central bank cannot simultaneously adjust its interest rates to mitigate domestic business cycle fluctuations, making fiscal policy the only usable tool for such countries.[47]

Macroeconomic teaching, research and informed debates normally evolve around formal (diagrammatic or equational) macroeconomic models to clarify assumptions and show their consequences in a precise way. Models include simple theoretical models, often containing only a few equations, used in teaching and research to highlight key basic principles, and larger applied quantitative models used by e.g. governments, central banks, think tanks and international organisations to predict effects of changes in economic policy or other exogenous factors or as a basis for making economic forecasting.[53]

Well-known specific theoretical models include short-term models like the Keynesian cross, the IS–LM model and the Mundell–Fleming model, medium-term models like the AD–AS model, building upon a Phillips curve, and long-term growth models like the Solow–Swan model, the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model and Peter Diamond's overlapping generations model. Quantitative models include early large-scale macroeconometric model, the new classical real business cycle models, microfounded computable general equilibrium (CGE) models used for medium-term (structural) questions like international trade or tax reforms, Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used to analyze business cycles, not least in many central banks, or integrated assessment models like DICE.

The IS–LM model, invented by John Hicks in 1936, gives the underpinnings of aggregate demand (itself discussed below). It answers the question ""At any given price level, what is the quantity of goods demanded?"" The graphic model shows combinations of interest rates and output that ensure equilibrium in both the goods and money markets under the model's assumptions.[54] The goods market is modeled as giving equality between investment and public and private saving (IS), and the money market is modeled as giving equilibrium between the money supply and liquidity preference (equivalent to money demand).[55]

The IS curve consists of the points (combinations of income and interest rate) where investment, given the interest rate, is equal to public and private saving, given output.[56] The IS curve is downward sloping because output and the interest rate have an inverse relationship in the goods market: as output increases, more income is saved, which means interest rates must be lower to spur enough investment to match saving.[56]

The traditional LM curve is upward sloping because the interest rate and output have a positive relationship in the money market: as income (identically equal to output in a closed economy) increases, the demand for money increases, resulting in a rise in the interest rate in order to just offset the incipient rise in money demand.[57]

The IS-LM model is often used in elementary textbooks to demonstrate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, though it ignores many complexities of most modern macroeconomic models.[54] A problem related to the LM curve is that modern central banks largely ignore the money supply in determining policy, contrary to the model's basic assumptions.[6]: 262  In some modern textbooks, consequently, the traditional IS-LM model has been modified by replacing the traditional LM curve with an assumption that the central bank simply determines the interest rate of the economy directly.[6]: 194 [5]: 113 

The AD–AS model is a common textbook model for explaining the macroeconomy.[58] The original version of the model shows the price level and level of real output given the equilibrium in aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The aggregate demand curve's downward slope means that more output is demanded at lower price levels.[59] The downward slope can be explained as the result of three effects: the Pigou or real balance effect, which states that as real prices fall, real wealth increases, resulting in higher consumer demand of goods; the Keynes or interest rate effect, which states that as prices fall, the demand for money decreases, causing interest rates to decline and borrowing for investment and consumption to increase; and the net export effect, which states that as prices rise, domestic goods become comparatively more expensive to foreign consumers, leading to a decline in exports.[59]

In many representations of the AD–AS model, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal at low levels of output and becomes inelastic near the point of potential output, which corresponds with full employment.[58] Since the economy cannot produce beyond the potential output, any AD expansion will lead to higher price levels instead of higher output.

In modern textbooks, the AD–AS model is often presented slightly differently, however, in a diagram showing not the price level, but the inflation rate along the vertical axis,[6]: 263 [11]: 399–428 [7]: 595  making it easier to relate the diagram to real-world policy discussions.[7]: vii  In this framework, the AD curve is downward sloping because higher inflation will cause the central bank, which is assumed to follow an inflation target, to raise the interest rate which will dampen economic activity, hence reducing output. The AS curve is upward sloping following a standard modern Phillips curve thought, in which a higher level of economic activity lowers unemployment, leading to higher wage growth and in turn higher inflation.[6]: 263 

In early February 2025, United States of America President Donald Trump stated that he would be imposing a 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on imported goods from China for US consumers.[60] A tariff in this case is a tax on imported goods and services. US consumers will be less likely to buy imports from those three countries due to the higher price they would have to pay. This was projected to reduce US imports by 15% and generate federal revenue of $100 billion.[61]

While imports from Mexico and Canada are important to the US, the US does not rely as much on Canadian and Mexican imports compared to Mexico's and Canada's economies being highly reliant on their exports to the USA. There would be higher production and grocery costs for the US but Mexico would have its economy reduced by 16% as the US takes in 80% of their car exports and 60% of their petroleum exports. In addition, Canada would have its economy reduced by similar amounts as the US takes in 70% of all of their exports.[60]

In relation to the expenditure approach to calculating GDP, (Exports - Imports) would reduce significantly due to reduced exports, which means a negative net exports and a lower GDP. [citation needed]

When looking at data presented by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, with a base year of 2017, we see that the GDP deflator has been trending upwards since then.[62] The base year serves as the standard year to which we can compare whether GDP increased or decreased. The base year's prices are used when calculating Real GDP for a specific year. For instance, calculating 2020's GDP Deflator would be equivalent to 2020's Nominal GDP/2020's Real GDP (using 2017 prices). The GDP Deflator has risen from 100 to 126.22 in 2024 Q4.

Key topics included GDP, national income, unemployment rates, inflation, consumption, saving, investment, energy, international trade and finance. Macroeconomics is distinct from microeconomics in its focus on aggregate variables and large-scale phenomena. The discipline is divided into short-term business cycle analysis, medium-term structural levels of inflation and unemployment, and long-term economic growth studies. Fiscal and monetary policies are crucial for mitigating economic fluctuations and improving living standards. The origins of macroeconomics trace back to John Maynard Keynes' 1936 publication 'The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,' leading to various schools of thought such as Keynesians and monetarists. Central concepts include output measurement (GDP), unemployment rates (cyclical vs structural), inflation dynamics (price indices), and open economy considerations like trade balances and exchange rates. Models like IS-LM and AD-AS are used to explain macroeconomic principles. Recent developments include endogenous growth theory integrating environmental concerns into economic models.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Mention of the meeting objectives (building rapport, sharing updates, discussing non-work topics)\n- Light-hearted comments to ease into the conversation"", ""Scene 2: Sharing Updates\nTLDR: Each participant shares recent personal or professional updates.\n- Economist shares insights on recent macroeconomic trends\n- High School Teacher discusses new teaching methods or experiences with students\n- Policy Advisor talks about recent policy developments or projects"", ""Scene 3: Discussion on Macroeconomics\nTLDR: Participants delve into key points from the article on macroeconomics.\n- Overview of GDP and national income by Economist\n- Unemployment rates discussion led by Policy Advisor\n- Inflation dynamics explained by High School Teacher in an engaging way"", ""Scene 4: Fiscal and Monetary Policies\nTLDR: Conversation shifts to fiscal and monetary policies and their impact.\n- Economist explains fiscal policy measures and their effects on economic fluctuations\n- Policy Advisor discusses practical implications of monetary policies\n- High School Teacher simplifies concepts for better understanding"", ""Scene 5: Open Economy Considerations\nTLDR: Participants explore international trade, finance, and open economy models.\n- Trade balances and exchange rates overview by Economist\n- Real-world examples provided by Policy Advisor\n- High School Teacher engages participants with relatable analogies"", ""Scene 6: Personal Experiences Related to Economics\nTLDR: Participants share personal stories related to economic concepts.\n- Economist shares a story about a significant economic event they experienced firsthand\n- High School Teacher talks about how they make economics relatable for students through storytelling\n- Policy Advisor recounts a memorable policy decision they were involved in"", ""Scene 7: Spontaneous Contributions & Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allowing space for spontaneous contributions and brief off-topic discussions.\n- Encouraging participants to bring up any unplanned topics or thoughts that arise naturally during conversation\n- Brief moments where participants can share light-hearted anecdotes or jokes"", ""Scene 8: Natural Disagreement & Resolution\nTLDR: Facilitating natural disagreements followed by resolution among participants.\n- Acknowledging differing viewpoints respectfully when discussing complex economic theories or policies \n - Encouraging constructive dialogue to reach common ground or agree to disagree amicably"", ""Scene 9: Wrap-Up & Next Steps \n TLDR : Concluding the meeting with final thoughts and future plans. \n - Summarizing key takeaways from the discussion \\ n - Discussing potential follow-up meetings or actions \\ n - Expressing appreciation for each other's contributions""]",">>High School Teacher: Hey everyone! How's it going? I hope you're all doing well. Let's dive into sharing updates and catching up.
>>Economist: Hi there! I'm hanging in there. It's nice to have a meeting focused on catching up rather than diving straight into heavy topics. What about you guys?
>>Policy Advisor: Hey folks! Pretty good, thanks. Yeah, it's refreshing to have a more relaxed meeting for a change. What's new with everyone?
>>High School Teacher: I'm doing great, just trying to keep my students engaged online. So, what's everyone been up to lately?
>>Economist: Well, I've been reading some interesting articles on economic trends. You know, trying to stay updated with the latest developments.
>>Policy Advisor: That sounds fascinating! What trends have you found most surprising recently?
>>Economist: There's a lot of talk about the impact of AI on job markets; it's pretty intriguing stuff.
>>Policy Advisor: I've been working on some policy recommendations that could impact our local economy significantly. Maybe we should consider how AI fits into those plans.
>>High School Teacher: That's really interesting! How do you think those trends will affect us locally? Also, I've been experimenting with new online tools for teaching; maybe we could exchange ideas sometime. 
 >>Economist: You know, the recent trends in inflation and unemployment are quite telling. We're seeing a cyclical pattern influenced by global supply chain disruptions and energy prices. This could mean tighter budgets and more cautious spending for local economies. It's fascinating how these numbers reflect deeper structural issues!

>>Policy Advisor: Right, from a policy standpoint, these macroeconomic trends have significant implications. Tighter budgets might lead to reduced public spending and potential cuts in social programs. So, how should we proceed with local economic policies to mitigate these effects?

>>High School Teacher: Okay, so here's the thing: I've been trying out some new teaching methods to keep my students engaged, especially with all these economic changes happening. Imagine using real-world examples like inflation and unemployment trends to make lessons more relatable. It's amazing how much more interested they become when they see how it affects their lives! What do you think?

>>Economist: That's a great idea! For instance, we could use case studies of historical economic events or current market fluctuations to illustrate key principles in class. This approach not only makes learning more engaging but also helps students understand the practical applications of what they're studying.

>>High School Teacher: Wow! I actually tried something similar last week with my economics class—we looked at the impact of rising gas prices on household budgets. The students were really into it because they could relate it to their own families' experiences.

>>Policy Advisor: Absolutely! Integrating real-world economic examples into other subjects could foster a holistic understanding among students. From a policy perspective, this approach not only enhances educational engagement but also prepares future generations to better navigate economic challenges.

>>Economist: And beyond education, businesses can benefit too. If we teach students about supply chain management through real-world scenarios, they'll be better equipped to handle such issues in their future careers.

>>Policy Advisor: Interesting point! While integrating real-world examples is beneficial, we must also consider the practical application of these theories in policy-making. How do we ensure that students not only understand these concepts but can apply them to solve real economic challenges?

>>High School Teacher: You know, it's amazing how these examples can make subjects like economics come alive for students. When they see the impact on their daily lives, it gets them thinking critically about the world around them.

>>Economist: Exactly! And if we extend this approach to other areas—like using historical events to explain economic cycles or scientific advancements affecting market trends—it can create a richer learning experience across disciplines.

>>High School Teacher: Imagine if we start using these examples in history or science; it could help students connect dots between different fields—like relating inflation trends to historical events or scientific advancements.

>>Policy Advisor: From a policy standpoint, integrating such examples is promising but requires careful curriculum development so that concepts are taught effectively and understood practically by students. We might need specific initiatives that support teachers with resources and training for this integration. 
 >>Economist: As we discussed earlier, fluctuations in GDP and national income are critical indicators of economic health. Let's explore specific policy adjustments to address these changes.

>>High School Teacher: Inflation affects purchasing power; if prices rise faster than wages, people can buy less with their money. It's a delicate balance we need to maintain.

>>Policy Advisor: To tackle unemployment effectively, we need policies that address skills gaps and regional economic differences. What strategies can we implement to achieve this?

>>Economist: Exactly! Addressing unemployment requires more than just stimulating job creation; we need to consider structural factors such as skills mismatches and regional disparities. How should we proceed with developing targeted interventions?

>>High School Teacher: Right, inflation is like when prices go up and our money doesn't stretch as far. Imagine this: if you had $10 last year and could buy ten apples, but now those same apples cost $1.50 each, you'd only get about six apples.

>>Policy Advisor: That's an interesting point about inflation affecting purchasing power. How do you think we can balance this with our current economic policies?

>>Economist: From a macroeconomic perspective, observing fluctuations in GDP and national income is crucial for policy adjustments. We need to be proactive in addressing these changes. 
 >>Policy Advisor: You know, from a policy standpoint, monetary policies can have profound practical implications on economic stability. For instance, adjusting interest rates can influence consumer spending and investment decisions significantly. We must carefully consider the timing and magnitude of these adjustments to avoid unintended consequences.
>>High School Teacher: Okay, so let's break it down. Imagine this: fiscal policy is like using your savings to buy things you need when times are tough. When the government spends more or cuts taxes, it can boost economic activity. On the other hand, monetary policy is about controlling the money supply and interest rates to keep things stable. If interest rates are low, people might borrow more and spend more, which can help during a recession.
>>Economist: From a macroeconomic perspective, fiscal policy measures such as government spending and tax cuts can indeed stimulate economic activity during downturns. However, we must also consider the potential for crowding out private investment and the long-term implications of increased public debt.
>>High School Teacher: So fiscal policy can be like a double-edged sword. While it can stimulate the economy during downturns, we also need to think about long-term effects like increased public debt. How do you balance these short-term benefits with potential long-term risks?
>>Economist: Given these risks, what strategies can we employ to mitigate potential negative impacts? 
>>Policy Advisor: Building on what we've discussed about public debt, we also need to consider how these policies might affect inflation rates over time.
>>Economist: Absolutely! That's a great point. Increased public debt could lead to higher inflation if not managed properly. To put it simply, we need to strike a balance between short-term gains and sustainable economic stability.
>>High School Teacher: While I see your point about inflation risks, some argue that targeted spending can mitigate these effects. 
 >>Economist: Targeted spending can help with inflation, but we need to watch out for long-term debt and import costs. If we focus too much on one side without considering the other, we'll end up causing more problems. We need to find that sweet spot where everything stays balanced.

>>Policy Advisor: True, and exchange rates play a big role here too. If our currency drops, exports get cheaper but imports cost more. This might improve our trade balance but also increase inflationary pressures. How should we proceed with this in mind?

>>High School Teacher: I see what you're saying about balancing trade. It's important to explain these concepts clearly to students so they understand how currency depreciation affects both exports and imports.

>>Economist: Exactly, the depreciation of our currency could boost exports by making them cheaper, but it also means imports become more expensive which can lead to inflationary pressures. The data suggests that finding a balance is crucial.

>>Policy Advisor: To illustrate this point further, consider the impact of tariffs on trade balances. When tariffs are imposed they can reduce imports by making foreign goods more expensive. This might improve our trade balance temporarily but could also lead to retaliatory measures from other countries affecting our exports and overall economic stability.

>>Economist: So given these factors, what specific measures can we take to balance trade while controlling inflation?

>>Policy Advisor: One approach could be implementing targeted subsidies for key industries to boost export competitiveness without significantly increasing public debt or import costs.

>>High School Teacher: And from an educational perspective, it's essential that students grasp these strategies so they understand real-world applications of economic policies. 
 >>Economist: I remember how tough things were during the 2008 crisis. It really showed how connected our economies are and led to a lot of changes in policies worldwide. What do you think this means for our future economic stability?
>>Policy Advisor: Absolutely, it was a wake-up call. I recall the decision to implement targeted subsidies for renewable energy sectors during the early 2010s. That move stimulated economic growth and fostered innovation in green technologies. It's a great example of how strategic policy decisions can drive both economic and environmental benefits.
>>High School Teacher: When I teach economics to my students, I try to make it relatable by using stories they can connect with. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, families had to adjust their budgets and make tough choices. Imagine being a teenager whose parents suddenly lose their jobs—you might have to give up some luxuries or even help out more at home. It helps them understand the real impact of economic events on everyday life.
>>Economist: That's a great way to make complex events relatable for students. Understanding the real-life impact definitely makes them more engaged.
>>Policy Advisor: Speaking of making complex topics relatable, I saw an interesting video recently that explained inflation using coffee prices. It was surprisingly effective!
>>High School Teacher: That's interesting! Using everyday examples like that can really help people grasp difficult concepts.
>>Policy Advisor: Indeed! And looking at renewable energy policies now, we can see ongoing benefits like job creation and technological advancements. It's exciting to think about where these innovations might lead us in the next decade. 
 >>High School Teacher: You know, explaining renewable energy policies to high school students can be a challenge. But if you use real-life examples like the impact on local jobs and advancements in technology, it becomes engaging. It's like showing them the future of work and innovation.

>>Economist: Renewable energy policies can drive job creation and technological innovation, but we need to ensure these benefits are distributed equitably across different sectors and regions. What strategies can we implement to achieve this?

>>Policy Advisor: Renewable energy policies can create jobs and boost local economies, but we also need to think about how they affect traditional energy sectors. How should we balance these effects?

>>High School Teacher: Exactly! And speaking of making things engaging, one of my students once asked if we could power the school with solar panels. Imagine that!

>>Economist: That's a great idea! It shows how renewable energy can be applied practically even at a local level.

>>Policy Advisor: Absolutely! Investing in solar panel installations not only creates jobs but also reduces energy costs for households and businesses. We need to balance these benefits with potential disruptions in traditional sectors.

>>High School Teacher: Yeah! And did you know that building small solar-powered devices is actually pretty fun? I tried it once with my class; they loved it!

>>Economist: That’s an interesting thought! It ties into how renewable energy policies can drive local innovations like solar panel installations while ensuring long-term economic stability.

>>Policy Advisor: From a policy standpoint, it's clear that renewable energy needs to create jobs while providing stability for traditional sectors. Investing in wind farms can boost local economies while still supporting existing industries. How should we proceed to balance these effects? 
 >>Economist: The challenge lies in ensuring that renewable energy investments don't disproportionately affect traditional sectors. Targeted subsidies can help traditional sectors immediately but might create dependency issues long-term. How do we balance this?

>>High School Teacher: If we focus too much on subsidies for renewables, traditional sectors might feel left out. What if we integrate both by using real-world examples in classrooms? Students could learn about balancing economic stability while promoting innovation.

>>Policy Advisor: Integrating subsidies with support for traditional sectors is essential but tricky—we must avoid creating dependencies that stifle innovation. Targeted investments can foster balanced growth.

>>Economist: True, but how do we interpret this for long-term economic stability? We need clear strategies that don't compromise either sector's growth.

>>High School Teacher: Maybe using case studies from both sectors could help students understand these complexities better—like analyzing data on local solar projects versus traditional industries.

>>Policy Advisor: Great idea! Case studies make policies tangible for students—they see real impacts on jobs and technology advancements firsthand.

>>Economist: Exactly! Highlighting risks as well as benefits helps students grasp the full picture—balancing factors for sustainable growth isn't easy.

>>High School Teacher: Right! Starting with local examples like solar panels at schools could show them how these technologies work practically within their community.

>>Policy Advisor: Absolutely! Local projects make abstract concepts real—and encourage critical thinking about environmental policies' impact locally and nationally.

>>Economist: Yes, discussing broader economic implications alongside local projects gives students a comprehensive view of sustainable development strategies.

>>High School Teacher: Got it! Combining local projects with broader policy discussions will give students a thorough understanding of these issues. 
 >>Policy Advisor: So, um, to wrap things up, we've talked about balancing renewable energy investments with traditional sectors and using real-world examples in education. Moving forward, we should definitely have follow-up meetings to discuss specific policy implementations and educational strategies. I really appreciate everyone's contributions today; your insights have been super helpful.

>>Economist: Absolutely! It's crucial that we keep this dialogue going. We can't overlook the long-term economic implications of our decisions. Maybe next time, we can dive deeper into the potential dependency issues from subsidies and explore more sustainable strategies for economic stability.

>>High School Teacher: Yeah, I agree! It's been great hearing all these perspectives. I'm excited about using local projects and case studies in my classroom to help students understand these complex issues better. Maybe we could even collaborate on some educational materials? What do you think would be a good starting point for that?

>>Policy Advisor: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Collaboration will be key in ensuring our strategies are both practical and impactful. By the way, has anyone seen the latest report on renewable energy trends? Let's set a date for our next meeting soon so we can start planning these initiatives.

>>Economist: Definitely! I'll prepare some data on subsidy impacts for us to review next time. Thanks again for the productive discussion.

>>High School Teacher: Thanks everyone! Looking forward to our next steps together."
