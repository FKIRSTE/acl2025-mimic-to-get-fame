Communication Studies,"Communication studies (or communication science) is an academic discipline that deals with processes of human communication and behavior, patterns of communication in interpersonal relationships, social interactions and communication in different cultures.[1] Communication is commonly defined as giving, receiving or exchanging ideas, information, signals or messages through appropriate media, enabling individuals or groups to persuade, to seek information, to give information or to express emotions effectively.[2][3] Communication studies is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge that encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation at a level of individual agency and interaction to social and cultural communication systems at a macro level.[4][5]

Scholarly communication theorists focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of communication, examining statistics in order to help substantiate claims. The range of social scientific methods to study communication has been expanding. Communication researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of communication.[6] Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally focused techniques.[7]

As a field of study, communication is applied to journalism, business, mass media, public relations, marketing, news and television broadcasting, interpersonal and intercultural communication, education, public administration, the problem of media-adequacy—and beyond.[8][9] As all spheres of human activity and conveyance are affected by the interplay between social communication structure and individual agency,[5][10][11] communication studies has gradually expanded its focus to other domains, such as health, medicine, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, social capital, and the role of communicative activity in the development of scientific knowledge.

Communication, a natural human behavior, became a topic of study in the 20th century.[12] As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. During this time, a renewed interest in the studies of rhetoric, such as persuasion and public address, was created, which ultimately laid the foundation for several of the forms of communication studies that we know of today.[13] The focus of communication studies developed further in the 20th century, eventually including means of communication such as mass communication, interpersonal communication, and oral interpretation.[13] When World War I ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The methods of communication that had been used during the war had challenged the beliefs many people had on the limits of it that existed prior to these events. Innovations were invented during this period of time that no one had ever seen before, like the aircraft telephones and throat microphones.[14] However, new ways of communicating that had been discovered, especially the use of morse code through portable morse code machines, helped troops to communicate in a much more rapid pace than ever before.[14] This then sparked ideas for even more advanced ways of communication to later be created and discovered.[14]

The social science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after World War II.[15] Prior to being established as its own discipline, communication studies, was formed from three other major studies no: psychology, sociology, and political science.[8][12][16] Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages.[17] Today, this accepted discipline now also encompasses more modern forms of communication studies as well, such as gender and communication, intercultural communication, political communication, health communication, and organizational communication.[13]

The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where early pioneers of the field worked after the Second World War.[16][18][19]

Wilbur Schramm is considered the founder of the field of communication studies in the United States.[19] Schramm was hugely influential in establishing communication as a field of study and in forming departments of communication studies across universities in the United States.[20] He was the first individual to identify himself as a communication scholar; he created the first academic degree-granting programs with communication in their name; and he trained the first generation of communication scholars.[21][22] Schramm had a background in English literature and developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and journalism. He also edited a textbook The Process and Effects of Mass Communication (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming Paul Lazarsfeld, Harold Lasswell, Carl Hovland, and Kurt Lewin as its founding forefathers.[19]

Schramm established three important communication institutes: the Institute of Communications Research (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), the Institute for Communication Research (Stanford University), and the East-West Communication Institute (Honolulu).[23] The patterns of scholarly work in communication studies that were set in motion at these institutes continue to this day.[24] Many of Schramm's students, such as Everett Rogers and David Berlo went on to make important contributions of their own.[22][25]

The first college of communication was founded at Michigan State University in 1958, led by scholars from Schramm's original ICR and dedicated to studying communication scientifically using a quantitative approach.[22][26] MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at Purdue University, University of Texas-Austin, Stanford University, University of Iowa, University of Illinois, University of Pennsylvania, The University of Southern California, and Northwestern University.[27][28]

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science.[18] This Association launched the Journal of Communication in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the International Communication Association (ICA).[28][29]

Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.[30]

The National Communication Association (NCA) recognizes several distinct but often overlapping specializations within the broader communication discipline including:[31] technology, critical-cultural, health, intercultural, interpersonal-small group, mass communication, organizational, political, rhetorical, and environmental communication. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include[citation needed] journalism, rhetoric, film criticism, theatre, public relations, political science (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as radio, television, computer-mediated communication, film production, and new media.

Many colleges in the United States offer a variety of different majors within the realm of communication studies, consisting of programs of study in the areas mentioned above. Communication studies is often perceived by many in society as being primarily centered around the media arts, however, those that become communication studies graduates could move on to have careers in areas ranging from media arts to public advocacy to marketing to non-profit organizations and even more.[32]

With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 Massey Commission,[33] which ""investigated the overall state of culture in Canada"",[33] the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and British Cultural Studies,[34] Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.[35] Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, Florian Sauvageau, Gertrude Robinson, Marc Raboy, Dallas Smythe, James R. Taylor, François Cooren, Gail Guthrie Valaskakis and George Grant.

Communication studies within Canada are a relatively new discipline, however, there are programs and departments to support and teach this topic in about 13 Canadian universities and many colleges as well.[36] The Communication et information from Laval, and the Canadian Journal of Communication from McGill University in Montréal, are two journals that exist in Canada.[36] There are also organizations and associations, both national and in Québec, that appeal to the specific interests that are targeted towards these academics.[36] These specific journals consist of representatives from the industry of communication, the government, and members of the public as a whole.[36]

Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy.[1] From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece).[37] Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with history, philosophy, English, and cultural studies.

Communication research informs politicians and policy makers, educators, strategists, legislators, business magnates, managers, social workers, non-governmental organizations, non-profit organizations, and people interested in resolving communication issues in general.[38] There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, cultural research, market research, and other statistical fields.

Recent critiques have been made about the homogeneity of communication scholarship. For example, Chakravartty, et al. (2018)[39] find that white scholars comprise the vast majority of publications, citations, and editorial positions. From a post-colonial point of view, this state is problematic because communication studies engages with a wide range of social justice concerns.

Business communication emerged as a field of study in the late 20th century, due to the centrality of communication within business relationships. The scope of the field is difficult to define because of the various ways in which communication is used between employers, employees, consumers, and brands.[40] Because of this, the focus of the field is usually placed on the demands of employers, which is more universally understood by the revision of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of business standards to emphasize written and oral communication as an important characteristic in the curriculum.[41] Business communication studies, therefore, revolve around the, ever changing, written and oral communication aspects directly related to the field of business.[42] Implementation of modern business communication curriculums are enhancing the study of business communication as a whole, while further preparing those to be able to effectively communicate in the business community.[40]

Health communication is a multidisciplinary field that practices the application of ""communication evidence, strategy, theory, and creativity"" in order to advance the well-being of people and populations. The term was first coined in 1975 by the International Communication Association and, in 1997, Health communication was officially recognized in the broader fields of Public Health Education and Health Promotion by the American Public Health Association.[43] The discipline integrates components of various theories and models, with a focus on social marketing. It uses marketing to develop ""activities and interventions designed to positively change behaviors.""[44] This emergence affected several dynamics of the healthcare system. It brought elevated awareness to different avenues including promotional activities and communication between heath professionals and their employees, patients, and constituents. ""Efforts to create marketing-oriented organizations called for the widespread dissemination of information"", putting a spotlight on theories of ""communication, the communication process, and the techniques that were being utilized to communicate in other settings.""[45] Now, health care organizations of all types are using things like social media. ""Uses include communicating with the community and patients; enhancing organizational visibility; marketing products and services; establishing a venue for acquiring news about activities, promotions, and fund-raising; providing a channel for patient resources and education; and providing customer service and support.""[46]

encompasses human communication processes, behavior patterns, and interactions across various cultures. Communication is defined as the exchange of ideas, information, signals, or messages through appropriate media to persuade, seek information, give information, or express emotions effectively. The field uses empirical investigation and critical analysis to study topics ranging from individual interactions to social and cultural systems. Theoretical understanding has evolved with qualitative and quantitative techniques expanding since the mid-20th century. Communication studies apply to journalism, business, mass media, public relations, marketing, education, public administration, health care, military institutions, and more. Wilbur Schramm was instrumental in establishing communication studies in the U.S., founding key institutes and training scholars who contributed significantly to the field. Major universities developed departments dedicated to scientific study using quantitative approaches. Associations like ICA and NCA recognize various specializations within communication studies. Canadian communication studies focus on national culture development influenced by American traditions but oriented towards state policy apparatuses. The discipline integrates social sciences and humanities perspectives and informs a wide range of professionals including politicians and educators. Recent critiques highlight homogeneity issues within scholarship.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the meeting\n- Brief greeting among participants\n- Setting objectives for the Innovation Forum\n- Encouraging open-mindedness and spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Exploring Innovative Ideas in Communication Studies\nTLDR: Discussing innovative ideas within communication studies\n- Communication Theorist shares insights on theoretical advancements\n- Media Specialist discusses technological impacts on communication\n- Intercultural Communication Expert highlights cultural dynamics in communication"", ""Scene 3: Identifying New Opportunities\nTLDR: Brainstorming new opportunities in various fields influenced by communication studies\n- Behavioral Psychologist explores behavioral patterns and their implications for innovation\n- Participants share personal experiences related to identifying opportunities in their fields"", ""Scene 4: Fostering a Culture of Innovation\nTLDR: Strategies to enhance a culture of innovation within organizations and academia\n- Discussion on fostering creativity and collaboration among teams\n- Sharing successful case studies and examples from participants' experiences"", ""Scene 5: Open Floor for Spontaneous Contributions\nTLDR: Allowing participants to bring up unplanned topics or ideas spontaneously\n- Participants share thoughts on emerging trends or recent developments in communication studies\n- Encouraging debate and natural disagreement with resolution"", ""Scene 6: Brief Off-topic Moments and Personal Experiences Sharing \nTLDR: Allowing brief off-topic moments to build rapport and share personal stories \n - Participants share anecdotes or humorous stories related to their professional journeys \n - Building camaraderie through informal discussions"", ""Scene 7: Conclusion and Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarizing key points discussed, outlining next steps, closing remarks \n - Recap of innovative ideas generated during the forum \n - Identified new opportunities highlighted \n - Final thoughts on fostering a culture of innovation \n - Closing remarks from each participant""]",">>Communication Theorist: Good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to be part of this Innovation Forum. Let's keep an open mind today as we explore new ideas together.
>>Media Specialist: Morning! Super excited to be here. I can't wait to hear all your creative thoughts!
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Hi everyone! Looking forward to our discussions today. Understanding how our different backgrounds influence communication can really spark some innovative ideas.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Good morning! Excited for today's session. From my perspective, staying open-minded will help us understand human nature better while we brainstorm new solutions. 
 >>Communication Theorist: You know, open-mindedness is crucial in communication studies. It lets us explore new ideas and understand how people interact. How can we keep our methods flexible to incorporate fresh insights?
>>Media Specialist: Absolutely! Technology has changed everything about how we communicate. Look at social media—Twitter and Instagram have completely transformed personal interactions and even political discussions!
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: That's a great point! Different cultures adapt to these changes in unique ways. For example, the use of emojis varies widely across cultures, reflecting different expressions and norms.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Right, and it's important to consider how these shifts affect our behavior. Social media interactions can reveal a lot about psychological motivations. How do we make sure our analysis stays relevant as things change so quickly?
>>Communication Theorist: Exactly! The way technology and culture influence communication is profound. How can we integrate these insights into more adaptable communication models?
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Yes, cultural dynamics are key here. Take the concept of 'face' in East Asian cultures—it greatly affects interpersonal interactions and conflict resolution strategies. How do we include such nuanced elements in our frameworks?
>>Communication Theorist: To put it simply—
>>Media Specialist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in—can you give an example of how 'face' impacts conflict resolution? I'm really curious about that.
>>Communication Theorist: Sure! In East Asian cultures, maintaining 'face' often means avoiding direct confrontation or criticism during conflicts. This approach prioritizes harmony and respect over blunt honesty.
>>Media Specialist: That's fascinating—
>>Behavioral Psychologist (speaking over briefly): And it ties into behavioral aspects too—how people manage their emotions during conflicts.
>>Media Specialist: Exactly! Speaking of technology again—
>>Intercultural Communication Expert (interrupting): Hold on a second—I think it's worth noting that 'face' also influences negotiation tactics, where indirect communication is preferred to preserve relationships.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Good point! And from a psychological perspective, this can lead to different stress responses compared to more direct conflict approaches seen in Western cultures.
>>Media Specialist: That's really insightful about 'face.' Speaking of how technology impacts these interactions, I've noticed that online platforms sometimes amplify cultural differences rather than bridge them. 
 >>Behavioral Psychologist: It's intriguing how these amplified cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts online. Understanding these dynamics could help us design better communication tools that promote empathy and collaboration.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Absolutely! Different societies adapt to technological changes in unique ways. For instance, emojis have become a vital part of digital communication in some cultures, while others still rely heavily on text. How can we leverage these cultural dynamics to create more inclusive and effective communication tools?
>>Communication Theorist: We can use our understanding of how culture affects communication to make better tools that people will enjoy using.
>>Media Specialist: You know, the way technology shapes our communication is amazing. Think about how social media algorithms can be tweaked to promote positive interactions and reduce toxicity.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Right! From a behavioral standpoint, understanding these patterns can help us design tools that encourage empathy and collaboration.
>>Media Specialist: Can you give an example of a tool that has successfully done this?
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Sure, platforms like ""Kind Words"" encourage users to send anonymous positive messages, fostering a supportive community.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Interesting point! In cross-cultural contexts, the way people interpret emojis can vary significantly. A smiley face might be seen as friendly in one culture but insincere in another. How can we design communication tools that account for these subtle cultural nuances?
>>Communication Theorist: That's true. Integrating insights from cultural dynamics into technology can bridge gaps and enhance user engagement.
>>Media Specialist: One fascinating opportunity lies in leveraging AI to analyze communication patterns. Imagine using machine learning to identify and promote positive interactions while minimizing negative ones.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Absolutely! And considering how different cultures use emojis could be key.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: You know, it's fascinating how cultural dynamics influence our interaction with technology. For example, in Japan, the concept of 'face' plays a significant role in online communication, prioritizing harmony and avoiding direct confrontation.
>>Communication Theorist: Indeed! But I think we also need to consider how these tools might inadvertently reinforce stereotypes if not carefully designed. 
 >>Behavioral Psychologist: Creating an environment where individuals feel safe to express their ideas without fear of judgment can significantly boost creativity and collaboration.

>>Media Specialist: That's a great point about creating safe spaces! How do you think digital platforms like Slack can help with that?

>>Behavioral Psychologist: Well, tools like Slack can facilitate open communication and make it easier for team members to share their thoughts in real-time, which helps in building that inclusive atmosphere.

>>Communication Theorist: We need to understand how team members communicate with each other. It's not just about safe spaces or tech; it's about how people interact and share ideas. For example, having regular check-ins can help capture innovative thoughts systematically.

>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Absolutely! And integrating diverse communication styles effectively can lead to innovative solutions. Understanding the different backgrounds and values that team members bring can turn differences into strengths.

>>Media Specialist: Exactly! And while creating safe spaces is crucial, we also need to consider the rapid evolution of media tools. Virtual reality, for instance, can immerse teams in collaborative environments that spark creativity like never before.

>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Interesting point! Recognizing the unique contributions from different cultural backgrounds is essential too. In cross-cultural contexts, incorporating diverse communication styles can enhance collaboration even further.

>>Communication Theorist: Employing practical models like regular brainstorming sessions or feedback loops can help analyze how new ideas spread within teams and organizations. These methods provide valuable insights into enhancing collaborative efforts.

>>Media Specialist: To be honest, while using technology like virtual reality is exciting, we need to consider how these tools integrate seamlessly into our daily workflows. AI-driven platforms can analyze team interactions dynamically and suggest ways to improve collaboration. 
 >>Communication Theorist: Um, theoretically speaking, the concept of 'media adequacy' is crucial here. How do we ensure that these advanced tools not only enhance but also align with our communicative needs? For instance, while AI-driven platforms can suggest improvements, they must be designed to foster genuine interactions rather than superficial ones.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: You know, from a cultural perspective, it's fascinating to see how different societies adapt to new communication technologies. For example, the use of emojis varies significantly across cultures, reflecting unique emotional expressions and social norms. How do we ensure these tools foster genuine connections rather than misinterpretations?
>>Media Specialist: Speaking of emojis, another technology worth considering is augmented reality. Imagine being able to have virtual meetings where you can interact with digital objects in real-time! That could revolutionize how we collaborate and share ideas.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Absolutely! From a behavioral standpoint, it's crucial to consider how these technologies impact our communication habits and social interactions. For instance, the use of augmented reality could potentially enhance collaboration by providing immersive experiences that foster deeper connections. But we must also be mindful of the potential for distraction or superficial engagement.
>>Communication Theorist: Indeed! Virtual reality offers an even deeper level of immersion which could further enhance our interactions. However—
>>Media Specialist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in—what about virtual reality? Isn't it similar but even more immersive?
>>Communication Theorist: Good point! Virtual reality does offer an even deeper level of immersion which could further enhance our interactions. However, both technologies need careful implementation to avoid superficial engagements.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Interesting! It's not just about the tools themselves but how they are used within different societal contexts. In some cultures, face-to-face communication is highly valued and digital interactions might be seen as less genuine. How do we ensure that these technologies enhance rather than replace meaningful human connections?
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone reacts differently; some chuckle while others smile)
>>(Phone stops ringing)
>>Media Specialist (smiling): Apologies for that interruption!
>>(Everyone chuckles)
>>Media Specialist (continuing): As I was saying—while emojis and augmented reality are cool, we should focus on how these technologies can actually improve our communication efficiency. AI-driven tools can analyze our communication patterns and suggest ways to make our interactions more effective. Amazing stuff! But we need careful implementation to avoid potential drawbacks like privacy concerns or over-reliance on technology. 
 >>Behavioral Psychologist: You know, it's funny how we sometimes overlook the simple things. I remember a project where we tried to implement AI-driven tools, but regular weekly check-ins were actually more effective in boosting team morale and collaboration.
>>Communication Theorist: That's so true! It really shows how important human connection is over technology sometimes. Do you think this applies to all types of teams?
>>Media Specialist: Definitely! I worked on a VR team-building project once, and people felt more connected than ever before.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: Interesting point! In my experience with multinational teams, cultural preferences really shape how technology is used—some prefer direct messaging while others value video calls.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Right! And adapting our methods for different teams based on their cultural norms made such a difference in engagement.
>>Communication Theorist: Absolutely. This highlights the need for culturally sensitive approaches in communication strategies. Simple adjustments can lead to more meaningful interactions.
>>Media Specialist: Technology can really surprise us sometimes. VR has this incredible ability to make people feel like they're actually in the same room during remote meetings; everyone was much more engaged.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: It's fascinating how cultural dynamics influence communication preferences. When we adapted our approach for a team in Japan by incorporating their preference for indirect styles, it led to more harmonious interactions.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: Hmm... It's interesting how these nuances play out in real-world scenarios. Adjusting feedback mechanisms based on cultural expectations really improved team cohesion.
>>Communication Theorist: Indeed! These examples show that understanding human behavior and cultural dynamics is crucial for effective communication strategies. Sometimes simple adjustments can have profound impacts. 
 >>Behavioral Psychologist: Um, one of the innovative ideas we discussed was the integration of regular check-ins to boost team morale. This simple yet effective approach can significantly enhance team collaboration and inclusivity.
>>Media Specialist: You know, using VR for team-building activities really stood out. It's amazing how immersive technology can foster deeper connections and collaboration. Integrating these tools thoughtfully can really enhance our communication strategies.
>>Communication Theorist: Building on what was mentioned earlier, we should also consider how these technologies can be tailored to specific team needs for maximum impact. Using different communication styles systematically will ensure everyone's ideas are heard and developed.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: From a cultural perspective, leveraging diverse communication styles to enhance team collaboration is crucial. This approach fosters inclusivity and bridges gaps between different cultural norms, ensuring dynamic interactions.
>>Media Specialist: I agree with what you said about VR, Communication Theorist. How do you think we can best implement it in our current setup?
>>Communication Theorist: Good question! We could start by identifying specific scenarios where VR would be most beneficial, like virtual brainstorming sessions or remote team-building exercises.
>>Media Specialist: One new opportunity we identified was leveraging AI-driven platforms to improve team interactions. These tools can dynamically adapt to different communication styles, fostering a more inclusive environment.
>>Intercultural Communication Expert: As the Media Specialist mentioned, AI-driven platforms are great for adapting to various communication styles. Additionally, regular intercultural training sessions are invaluable for bridging gaps between different cultural norms and enhancing mutual understanding among team members from diverse backgrounds.
>>Behavioral Psychologist: I mean, from a behavioral standpoint, these training sessions can significantly improve team dynamics by promoting empathy and respect among members.
>>Media Specialist: Honestly, leveraging AI-driven platforms to improve team interactions is a game-changer. These tools adapt dynamically to different communication styles, fostering inclusivity and efficiency.
>>Communication Theorist: While I see the benefits of VR for team-building activities, I'm concerned about its cost-effectiveness for our budget. We need to weigh the potential gains against the investment required carefully."
