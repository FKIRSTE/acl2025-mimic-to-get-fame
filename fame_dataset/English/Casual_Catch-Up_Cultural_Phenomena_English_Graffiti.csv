Graffiti,"Graffiti (singular graffiti, or graffito only in graffiti archeology) is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view. Graffiti ranges from simple written ""monikers"" to elaborate wall paintings, and has existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire.
Modern graffiti is a controversial subject. In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered vandalism. Modern graffiti began in the New York City subway system and Philadelphia in the early 1970s and later spread to the rest of the United States and throughout the world.


Etymology
""Graffiti"" (usually both singular and plural) and the rare singular form ""graffito"" are from the Italian word graffiato (""scratched""). In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes chalk or coal were used. The word originates from Greek γράφειν—graphein—meaning ""to write"".


History


Prehistoric

Most petroglyphs and geoglyphs date between 40,000 and 10,000 years old, the oldest being cave paintings in Australia. Paintings in the Chauvet Cave were made 35,000 years ago, but little is known about who made them or why. Early artists created stencil graffiti of their hands with paint blown through a tube. These stencils may have functioned similarly to a modern-day tag.


Ancient

The oldest written graffiti was found in Ancient Rome around 2500 years ago. Most graffiti from the time was boasts about sexual experiences, but also includes word games such as the Sator Square, ""I was here"" type markings, and comments on gladiators. Graffiti in Ancient Rome was a form of communication, and was generally not considered vandalism. Certain graffiti was seen as blasphemous and was removed, such as the Alexamenos graffito, which may contain one of the earliest depictions of Jesus. The graffito features a human with the head of a donkey on a cross with the text ""Alexamenos worships [his] god.""


Medieval
The only known source of the Safaitic language, an ancient form of Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern Syria, eastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.
Ancient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka write their names and commentary over the ""mirror wall"", adding up to over 1800 individual graffiti produced there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there.
Among the ancient political graffiti examples were Arab satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an Umayyad Arab and Persian poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between Sajistan and Basra, manifesting a strong hatred towards the Umayyad regime and its walis, and people used to read and circulate them very widely.
Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls. When Renaissance artists such as Pinturicchio, Raphael, Michelangelo, Ghirlandaio, or Filippino Lippi descended into the ruins of Nero's Domus Aurea, they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the grottesche style of decoration.

Contemporary
In the 1790s, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic campaign of Egypt. Lord Byron's survives on one of the columns of the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion in Attica, Greece.
The oldest known example of graffiti monikers were found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers since the late 1800s. The Bozo Texino monikers were documented by filmmaker Bill Daniel in his 2005 film, Who is Bozo Texino?.
Contemporary graffiti has been seen on landmarks in the US, such as Independence Rock, a national landmark along the Oregon Trail.
In World War II, an inscription on a wall at the fortress of Verdun was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:

During World War II and for decades after, the phrase ""Kilroy was here"" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of Charlie Parker (nicknamed ""Yardbird"" or ""Bird""), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words ""Bird Lives"".

Modern
Modern graffiti style has been heavily influenced by hip hop culture and started with young people in 1960s and 70s in New York City and Philadelphia. Tags were the first form of stylised contemporary graffiti, starting with artists like TAKI 183 and Cornbread. Later, artists began to paint throw-ups and pieces on trains on the sides of subway trains. and eventually moved into the city after the NYC metro began to buy new trains and paint over graffiti.
While the art had many advocates and appreciators—including the cultural critic Norman Mailer—others, including New York City mayor Ed Koch, considered it to be defacement of public property, and saw it as a form of public blight. While those who did early modern graffiti called it ""writing"",  the 1974 essay ""The Faith of Graffiti"" referred to it using the term ""graffiti"", which stuck.
An early graffito outside of New York or Philadelphia was the inscription in London reading ""Clapton is God"" in reference to the guitarist Eric Clapton. Creating the cult of the guitar hero, the phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in Islington, north London, in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall.
Films like Style Wars in the 80s depicting famous writers such as Skeme, Dondi, MinOne, and ZEPHYR reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s. Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.


Commercialization and pop culture

With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant IBM launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a peace symbol, a heart, and Tux (Linux penguin mascot), to represent ""Peace, Love, and Linux."" IBM paid Chicago and San Francisco collectively US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.
In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by Sony and executed by its advertising agency in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld PlayStation Portable (PSP) gaming system. In this campaign, taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings ""a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse"".


Global movements
When graffiti is done as an art form, it often uses the Latin script even in countries where it is not the primary writing system. English words are also often used as monikers.


Europe
Stencil graffiti artists such as Blek le Rat existed in Western Europe, especially in Paris, before the arrival of American graffiti and was associated more with the punk rock scene than with hip-hop. In the 1980s, American graffiti and hiphop began to influence the European graffiti scene. Modern graffiti reached Eastern Europe in the 1990s.
Some of the earliest graffiti exhibitions outside of the USA were in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.


Middle East
Graffiti in the Middle East has emerged slowly, with taggers operating in Egypt, Lebanon, the Gulf countries like Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and in Iran. The major Iranian newspaper Hamshahri has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist A1one's works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, PingMag, has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work. The Israeli West Bank barrier has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the Berlin Wall. Many writers in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference ""נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן"" (""Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman"") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.

Graffiti has played an important role within the street art scene in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially following the events of the Arab Spring of 2011 or the Sudanese Revolution of 2018/19. Graffiti is a tool of expression in the context of conflict in the region, allowing people to raise their voices politically and socially. Famous street artist Banksy has had an important effect in the street art scene in the MENA area, especially in Palestine where some of his works are located in the West Bank barrier and Bethlehem.


South America
South America has a very active graffiti culture, and graffiti are very common in Brazilian cities. This is blamed on the high uneven distribution of income, changing laws, and disenfranchisement. Pichação is a form of graffiti found in Brazil, which involves tall characters and is usually used as a form of protest. It contrasts with the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of grafite.
Prominent Brazilian writers include Os Gêmeos, Boleta, Nunca, Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.


Southeast Asia
There are also a large number of graffiti influences in Southeast Asian countries that mostly come from modern Western culture, such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.

Types


Tools
Spray paint and markers are the main tools used for tagging, throw ups, and pieces. Paint markers, paint dabbers, and scratching tools are also used. Some art companies, such as Montana Colors, make art supplies specifically for graffiti and street art. Many major cities have graffiti art stores.

Stencil graffiti

Stencil graffiti is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as cardboard or subject folders) to form an overall design or image. The stencil is then placed on the ""canvas"" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by artists Blek le Rat in Paris, in 1982 by Jef Aerosol in Tours (France); by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and Melbourne, where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.


Stickers

Stickers, also known as slaps, are drawn or written on before being put up in public. Stickers that became widely used include the United States Postal Service's Label 228 and name tags stickers. Name tag stickers that were printed with the text ""Hello my name is"", first introduced by C-Line Products in 1959, became widely used in both graffiti and sticker art. Eggshell stickers, which are very difficult to remove, are also frequently used. Stickers allow artists to put up their art quickly and discreetly, making them a relatively safer option for illegal graffiti.


Tags

Tagging is the practice of writing one's ""name, initial or logo onto a public surface"" in a handstyle unique to the writer. Tags were the first form of modern graffiti.
A number of recent examples of graffiti make use of hashtags.


Throw ups

Throw ups, or throwies are large, bubble-writing graffiti which aim to be ""throw onto"" a surface as largely and quickly as possible. Throw ups can have fills or be ""hollow"". They prioritise minimal negative space and consistency or letter space and height.


Pieces

Pieces are large, elaborate, letter-based graffiti which usually use spray paint or rollers. Pieces often have multi-coloured fills and outlines, and may use highlights, shadows, backgrounds, extensions, 3D effects, and sometimes characters.


Wildstyle

Wildstyle is the most complex form of modern graffiti. It can be difficult for those unfamiliar with the art form to read. Wildstyle draws inspiration from calligraphy and has been described as partially abstract. The term ""wildstyle"" was popularized by the Wild Style graffiti crew formed by Tracy 168 of the Bronx, New York in 1974.


Modern experimentation

Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, Graffiti Research Lab has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes (throwies) as new media for graffitists. Yarnbombing is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffitists.


Purpose
Theories on the use of graffiti by avant-garde artists have a history dating back at least to the Asger Jorn, who in 1962 painting declared in a graffiti-like gesture ""the avant-garde won't give up"".


Public art
People who appreciate graffiti often believe that it should be on display for everyone in public spaces, not hidden away in a museum or a gallery. Art should color the streets, not the inside of some building. Graffiti is a form of art that cannot be owned or bought. It does not last forever, it is temporary, yet one of a kind. It is a form of self promotion for the artist that can be displayed anywhere from sidewalks, roofs, subways, building wall, etc. Art to them is for everyone and should be shown to everyone for free.


Personal expression
Graffiti is a way of communicating and a way of expressing oneself. It is art and a functional thing that can warn people of something or inform people of something. However, graffiti is to some people a form of art, but to some a form of vandalism. And many graffitists choose to protect their identities and remain anonymous to hinder prosecution.
With the commercialization of graffiti (and hip hop in general), in most cases, even with legally painted ""graffiti"" art, graffitists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the one of four hip hop elements that is not considered ""performance art"" despite the image of the ""singing and dancing star"" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffitists still fall in the category of the introverted archetypal artist.
Banksy is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society. He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in Bristol, England, but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to Palestine. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial West Bank barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of exhibitions also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.
Graffiti artists may become offended if photographs of their art are published in a commercial context without their permission. In March 2020, the Finnish graffiti artist Psyke expressed his displeasure at the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat publishing a photograph of a Peugeot 208 in an article about new cars, with his graffiti prominently shown on the background. The artist claims he does not want his art being used in commercial context, not even if he were to receive compensation.

Territorial
Territorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic symbols and initials strictly fashioned with unique calligraphies. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.


Radical and political

Many analysts and art critics see artistic value in some graffiti and recognize it as a form of public art. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles graffiti is an effective tool of social emancipation, or for the achievement of a political goal.
In times of conflict graffiti has offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and has been an effective tool for establishing dialog. The Berlin Wall was extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures related to the oppressive Soviet rule over the GDR.
Graffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the anarcho-punk band Crass, who conducted a campaign of stenciling anti-war, anarchist, feminist, and anti-consumerist messages throughout the London Underground system during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In Amsterdam, graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered in names such as ""De Zoot"", ""Vendex"", and ""Dr Rat"". To document the graffiti, a punk magazine was started that was called Gallery Anus. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s, there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.

The student protests and general strike of May 1968 saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire (""Boredom is counterrevolutionary"") and Lisez moins, vivez plus (""Read less, live more""). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.
Billboards and other consumer advertising have been the target of graffiti. From 1978 to 1994 tobacco, alcohol and other advertising was regularly painted over in Australia by the group Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions (BUGA UP). At one point, up to fifty billboards were altered a week, with the group specialising in altering advertising slogans and images to change their meaning.

The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as ""on the street"" or ""underground"", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the subvertising, culture jamming, or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of Street Art, a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting.
Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as Alexander Brener, have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.
The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the Space Hijackers did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political imagery.
Berlin human rights activist Irmela Mensah-Schramm has received global media attention and numerous awards for her 35-year campaign of effacing neo-Nazi and other right-wing extremist graffiti throughout Germany, often by altering hate speech in humorous ways.

Genocide denial

In the Serbian capital, Belgrade, the graffiti depicting a uniformed former general of Serb army and war criminal, convicted at ICTY for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide and ethnic cleansing in Bosnian War, Ratko Mladić, appeared in a military salute alongside the words ""General, thanks to your mother"". 
Aleks Eror, Berlin-based journalist, explains how ""veneration of historical and wartime figures"" through street art is not a new phenomenon in the region of former Yugoslavia, and that ""in most cases is firmly focused on the future, rather than retelling the past"". In a long expose on the subject of Bosnian genocide denial, at Balkan Diskurs magazine and multimedia platform website, Kristina Gadže and Taylor Whitsell referred to these experiences as a young generations' ""cultural heritage"", in which youths are being exposed to the celebration and affirmation of war-criminals as part of their ""formal education"" and ""inheritance"".

There are examples of genocide denial through the celebration and affirmation of war criminals throughout the region of Western Balkans, inhabited by Serbs, using graffiti. Several of these are found in the Serbian capital, and many more across Serbia and the Bosnian and Herzegovinian administrative entity, Republika Srpska, which is the ethnic Serbian majority enclave. Critics point that Serbia as a state, is willing to defend the mural of convicted war criminal, and have no intention to react on cases of genocide denial, noting that Interior Minister of Serbia, Aleksandar Vulin decision to ban any gathering with an intent to remove the mural, with the deployment of riot police, sends the message of ""tacit endorsement"". Consequently, on 9 November 2021, Serbian heavy police in riot gear, with the graffiti creators and their supporters, blocked the access to the mural to prevent human rights groups and other activists to paint over it and mark the International Day Against Fascism and Antisemitism in that way, and even arrested two civic activist for throwing eggs at the graffiti.


Offensive graffiti

Graffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly). Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as ""racist"". It can then be understood only if one knows the relevant ""local code"" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as heteroglot and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.
A spatial local code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the herald of more serious criminal activity to come. A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.
By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints), these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.
Elsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted caricatures of local officials with their mouths as potholes, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads. In Manchester, England, a graffitists painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in them being repaired within 48 hours.


Decorative and high art

In the early 1980s, the first art galleries to show graffitists to the public were Fashion Moda in the Bronx, Now Gallery and Fun Gallery, both in the East Village, Manhattan.
A 2006 exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's outer boroughs and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. It displayed 22 works by New York graffitists, including Crash, Daze, and Lady Pink. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine Time Out, curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti.
From the 1970s onwards, Burhan Doğançay photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as ""Walls of the World"" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled ""Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent ..."" (The walls whisper, shout and sing ...) at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.
In Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. Oxford University Press's art history text Australian Painting 1788–2000 concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary visual culture, including the work of several Australian practitioners.
Between March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Environmental effects
Spray paint has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint onto a surface.
Volatile organic compound (VOC) leads to ground level ozone formation and most of graffiti related emissions are VOCs. A 2010 paper estimates 4,862 tons of VOCs were released in the United States in activities related to graffiti.


Government responses


Asia
In China, Mao Zedong in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanize the country's communist movement.
Based on different national conditions, many people believe that China's attitude towards Graffiti is fierce, but in fact, according to Lance Crayon in his film Spray Paint Beijing: Graffiti in the Capital of China, Graffiti is generally accepted in Beijing, with artists not seeing much police interference. Political and religiously sensitive graffiti, however, is not allowed.
In Hong Kong, Tsang Tsou Choi was known as the King of Kowloon for his calligraphy graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.
In Taiwan, the government has made some concessions to graffitists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated ""Graffiti Zones"". From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, ""We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti"". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in Ximending, a popular shopping district. Graffitists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to NT$6,000 under a department of environmental protection regulation. However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, ""Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively.""
In 1993, after several expensive cars in Singapore were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the Singapore American School, Michael P. Fay, questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 Vandalism Act of Singapore, originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a caning. The New York Times ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for clemency, Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding president of Singapore, Ong Teng Cheong, agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.
In South Korea, Park Jung-soo was fined two million South Korean won by the Seoul Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the G-20 Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in ""G-20"" sounds like the Korean word for ""rat"", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, ""an ominous creature like a rat"" amounts to ""an organized criminal activity"" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.

Europe

In Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged two prehistoric paintings of bison in the Cave of Mayrière supérieure near the French village of Bruniquel in Tarn-et-Garonne, earning them the 1992 Ig Nobel Prize in archeology.
In September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.
In Budapest, Hungary, both a city-backed movement called I Love Budapest and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.


United Kingdom

The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the Keep Britain Tidy campaign issued a press release calling for zero tolerance of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing ""on the spot"" fines to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16. The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in music videos, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed ""cool"" or ""edgy'"" image.
To back the campaign, 123 Members of Parliament (MPs) (including then Prime Minister Tony Blair), signed a charter which stated: ""Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem.""
In the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 (as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.
In July 2008, a conspiracy charge was used to convict graffitists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation, nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit criminal damage costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.
Some councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffitists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the ""spray and run"".

Australia

Ancient rock art in Australia is seen as a sacred part of First Nations histories, and many of it is legally protected, and some are given National Heritage status.

In an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by writers. One early example is the ""Graffiti Tunnel"" located at the Camperdown Campus of the University of Sydney, which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and paint. Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or trespassing. Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere. Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced ""anti-graffiti squads"", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.
Many state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.
Melbourne is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as Hosier Lane in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The Lonely Planet travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including sticker art, poster, stencil art, and wheatpasting, can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; Fitzroy, Collingwood, Northcote, Brunswick, St. Kilda, and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a perspex screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.


New Zealand

In February 2008 Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in Auckland during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.

Tracker databases
Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to a city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them not only to focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.


Gang injunctions
Many restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing both public and private property, including but not limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, tree, or power pole.


Hotlines and reward programs
To help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.


Search warrants
When police obtain search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation, they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays; etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects, which could be used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces; permanent marking pens, markers, or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew; paraphernalia including any reference to ""(tagger's name)""; any drawings, writing, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or any mention of tagging crew membership; and any newspaper clippings relating to graffiti crime.

Graffiti, defined as unauthorized writing or drawings on public surfaces, has ancient origins with examples from Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Modern graffiti emerged in the 1970s in New York City and Philadelphia, evolving into a global phenomenon influenced by hip hop culture. The term 'graffiti' comes from the Italian word 'graffiato,' meaning scratched. Historical forms include prehistoric cave paintings and Roman inscriptions. Contemporary graffiti includes tags, throw-ups, pieces, stencil art, and stickers. It serves various purposes such as personal expression, political activism, territorial marking by gangs, and commercialization through advertising campaigns. Governments worldwide have responded differently to graffiti; some endorse it as public art while others criminalize it. Environmental concerns were raised due to the toxic chemicals in spray paint. The meeting concluded with discussions on the impact of graffiti on urban environments and its role in social movements.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Mention of the meeting objectives"", ""Scene 2: Graffiti History Overview\nTLDR: Historian provides a brief overview of graffiti's history and evolution.\n- Ancient origins in Egypt, Greece, Rome\n- Modern emergence in NYC and Philadelphia\n- Influence of hip hop culture"", ""Scene 3: Artistic Expression\nTLDR: Street Artist shares insights on contemporary graffiti styles and personal experiences.\n- Tags, throw-ups, pieces, stencil art, stickers\n- Personal expression through graffiti\n- Anecdotes from recent projects"", ""Scene 4: Social Impact Discussion\nTLDR: Sociologist discusses the impact of graffiti on communities and social movements.\n- Political activism through graffiti\n- Territorial marking by gangs\n- Role in social change"", ""Scene 5: Legal Implications Debate\nTLDR: Legal Expert outlines legal perspectives on graffiti and engages in debate with participants.\n- Criminalization vs. endorsement as public art\n- Property rights and vandalism regulations\n- Environmental concerns with spray paint"", ""Scene 6: Urban Planning Insights\nTLDR: Urban Planner talks about integrating street art within city landscapes.\n- Design principles for urban spaces\n- Examples of successful integration projects\n- Future possibilities for street art in cities"", ""Scene 7: Open Floor for Spontaneous Contributions\nTLDR: Participants share personal stories or thoughts related to graffiti or other topics.\n- Encouragement for off-topic moments \n - Sharing personal experiences relevant to discussion points \n - Natural disagreements and resolutions""]",">>Street Artist: Hey everyone! How's it going? Ready to dive into some cool discussions today?
>>Historian: Hi there! I'm looking forward to our discussion.
>>Sociologist: Hey folks! I'm really looking forward to exploring graffiti's social impact.
>>Legal Expert: Hey everyone, excited for today's talk.
>>Urban Planner: Excited to discuss how street art fits into our city designs.
>>Street Artist: Great to see everyone's enthusiasm! Let's dive into our first topic: integrating street art into urban planning. 
 >>Historian: Graffiti has ancient origins, dating back to Egypt, Greece, and Rome. For example, in Pompeii, you can find political messages and advertisements carved into walls. Modern graffiti emerged in the 1970s in NYC and Philadelphia, heavily influenced by hip hop culture.
>>Sociologist: It's fascinating how graffiti evolved from those ancient forms of expression to a powerful voice within hip hop culture. There are studies showing how murals have revitalized neighborhoods and fostered community pride.
>>Street Artist: Yeah, it's like the heartbeat of urban culture. I remember tagging my first wall—it felt like I was part of something bigger. Graffiti's not just art; it's a way to speak out and be heard.
>>Legal Expert: Legally speaking, graffiti is often classified as vandalism when done without permission. But there are cities experimenting with legal graffiti zones where artists can create freely without risking criminal charges.
>>Urban Planner: Integrating graffiti into urban planning can really transform city landscapes. Take Wynwood Walls in Miami—it's become a major cultural attraction that boosts local businesses and tourism.
>>Street Artist: Exactly! When cities support street art, it turns into something beautiful for everyone. It's more than just personal expression; it's about connecting with people through your work.
>>Historian: Historically, graffiti has served as social commentary—from Roman political messages to modern-day street art influenced by hip hop culture. Each era leaves its mark through these expressions.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely! And there's research showing how public art projects can reduce crime rates and increase community engagement. It's like a visual dialogue that reflects the identity and struggles of the people living there.
>>Street Artist: Wow! That's amazing to hear. Every tag and piece is a shout-out to the past while making a statement in the present.
>>Legal Expert: While unauthorized graffiti crosses into vandalism legally speaking, some communities are working on initiatives that allow sanctioned spaces for artists to express themselves legally—bridging the gap between property rights and artistic freedom.
>>Urban Planner: Yes, like the project in Melbourne where designated areas for street art have turned previously neglected spaces into vibrant hubs of activity. It shows how thoughtful integration can enhance both aesthetic and cultural value. 
 >>Street Artist: You know, when I'm out there tagging or creating pieces, it's like I'm leaving a part of myself on the wall. I recently did a throw-up in an alley that was just begging for some color—seriously! It transformed the whole vibe of the place. And don't get me started on stencil art; it's amazing how a simple design can make such a bold statement.
>>Historian: Graffiti has evolved significantly over the centuries. From ancient Rome's boastful inscriptions to the political messages during the Arab Spring, graffiti is a reflection of society. It's fascinating how these markings can convey profound messages and catalyze change.
>>Sociologist: Graffiti speaks volumes. It's fascinating how vibrant murals or stencil art can breathe life into neglected areas. Social change starts here.
>>Legal Expert: Most laws see unauthorized graffiti as vandalism because property rights matter—
>>Urban Planner (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! But what if we had designated areas for street art? Wouldn't that help balance legal concerns with artistic expression?
>>Legal Expert: That's an interesting point. Designated areas could indeed provide a solution by allowing artists to express themselves legally while respecting property rights.

>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone laughs)
>>(Phone stops ringing)

>>Urban Planner: Integrating street art into urban planning can really enhance our cityscapes. A mural or stencil can turn forgotten corners into cultural hubs that attract both locals and tourists.
>>Street Artist: It's not just about the art itself but the stories behind it. Like, I recently did a piece using stickers in a busy intersection—it's amazing how something so small can catch people's attention and spark conversations! Those throw-ups are like quick bursts of creativity that change the whole vibe of a place.
>>Historian: Historically, graffiti has served as a powerful tool for social commentary and political expression throughout history. From ancient Roman inscriptions to revolutionary slogans in Paris, it's intriguing how it has evolved into vibrant murals and stencil art that transform urban spaces today.

>>(Someone sneezes)
>>(Everyone chuckles)

>>Sociologist: Bless you! As I was saying earlier, it's incredible how street art can breathe new life into neglected areas.
>>Urban Planner: Absolutely! And if we integrate it thoughtfully into urban planning, we could create spaces that resonate with people on multiple levels. 
 >>Sociologist: Graffiti speaks volumes about the community's voice and identity. It's fascinating how it can be a tool for political activism, you know? Social change starts here.
>>Street Artist: Exactly! Graffiti is like the heartbeat of the streets. It's not just about marking territory or making a statement; it's about expressing raw emotions and ideas.
>>Historian: And historically, graffiti has been used from ancient Roman walls to the Berlin Wall as a medium for dissent and rallying communities.
>>Legal Expert: Legally, graffiti is often seen as vandalism. Unauthorized markings can lead to fines or even jail time because they violate property rights.
>>Street Artist: Sure, but graffiti is more than just a legal issue or historical artifact. It's a powerful form of artistic expression that can transform urban spaces and spark social change.
>>Sociologist: Absolutely! It fosters a sense of community and creates dialogue among residents.
>>Urban Planner: Integrating graffiti into urban planning can create vibrant spaces that engage communities. For instance, murals in public parks have transformed these areas into cultural hubs.
>>Historian: Historically, it's always been used to voice dissent and rally communities, from ancient Rome to modern urban landscapes.
>>Legal Expert: While graffiti can serve as a powerful tool for social change, unauthorized markings are classified as vandalism and can lead to significant legal consequences including fines and imprisonment.
>>Sociologist: While graffiti fosters belonging among residents, we must also address its potential to cause territorial disputes. 
 >>Legal Expert: Unauthorized graffiti is considered vandalism under most laws. Property rights are important, and defacing property without permission can lead to serious consequences like fines or jail time.
>>Street Artist: I get that unauthorized graffiti is considered vandalism, but have you seen how some murals can completely change the vibe of a neighborhood? Graffiti is the voice of the streets; it's a form of artistic expression that can transform urban spaces and give them life!
>>Historian: Historically, graffiti has been used for social commentary and expressing dissent across various cultures. It's always been more than just vandalism; it's a reflection of society.
>>Sociologist: That's true! And while unauthorized graffiti is legally considered vandalism, we can't ignore its social impact. Graffiti often serves as a powerful tool for community expression and can foster a sense of identity and belonging among residents.
>>Urban Planner: Integrating street art into urban planning can be a game-changer. We could designate certain walls for murals or organize community art projects to revitalize neglected areas. City planning is an art, and when we incorporate street art thoughtfully, it enhances the cultural fabric of our cities.
>>Street Artist: Yeah! And while spray paint can be harmful to the environment, there are eco-friendly alternatives out there. Some artists are using water-based paints and even digital projections to keep it green. Art is life, but we gotta keep it real with Mother Earth too!
>>Sociologist: Absolutely! It's fascinating how graffiti can foster a sense of identity among residents. But we also need to consider the environmental impact—the toxic chemicals released from traditional spray paint can harm our surroundings.
>>Legal Expert: From a legal perspective—while I understand the cultural significance—the law remains clear on this matter. Unauthorized graffiti is classified as vandalism; property rights are paramount. The environmental impact only adds complexity here—even eco-friendly alternatives must have consent from property owners. 
 >>Urban Planner: You know, integrating street art into urban planning can really transform spaces. Designated mural areas not only enhance the aesthetic but also foster community engagement and cultural expression. Take Melbourne's laneways, for instance—these vibrant hubs have become iconic attractions, boosting local businesses and tourism.

>>Street Artist: Street art really brings cities to life! It adds color and character to those concrete jungles. Imagine if murals could change with the seasons—that'd be awesome! And what if we had interactive murals that respond to people passing by? That would make art a part of everyday life.

>>Historian: Graffiti has always been a form of societal reflection. From ancient Rome to modern cities, it's served as a voice for the marginalized and a canvas for public expression. Integrating street art into urban planning preserves this historical tradition while enriching community identity.

>>Sociologist: Graffiti speaks volumes about the communities it inhabits. It's not just about beautifying spaces; it's about creating a sense of belonging and identity. Cities could use street art to tell local stories or highlight social issues—it gives walls a voice that resonates with everyone.

>>Legal Expert: While designated mural areas provide legal avenues for artistic expression, unauthorized graffiti is still classified as vandalism under most jurisdictions, which can lead to fines or imprisonment. We need frameworks that balance creative freedom with property rights and regulations.

>>Urban Planner: Exactly! Urban spaces are our canvas. Integrating street art isn't just about aesthetics; it's about weaving creativity into the fabric of our cities. But we also need to consider practical aspects like maintenance and funding—it's not just art; it's evolution!

>>Street Artist: Totally! Street art is more than splashing colors; it's creating dialogue with the environment and people who pass by. Augmented reality could make murals come alive—how cool would that be?

>>Historian: Historically, graffiti has been a powerful tool for social commentary—from ancient Roman walls to modern political movements. It's important we preserve this tradition while finding ways to manage it responsibly in urban settings.

>>Sociologist: Right! Graffiti transforms community identity and sparks social change. But there's always the challenge of ensuring it reflects diverse voices without becoming commercialized or losing its authenticity.

>>Legal Expert: Actually, managing designated mural areas effectively requires careful planning to ensure compliance with property rights while fostering artistic expression legally. 
 >>Street Artist: Graffiti is like the heartbeat of the city, but it's not just about painting walls. It's about telling stories and connecting with people. When I see a mural that speaks to me, it feels like discovering a hidden gem in the urban jungle. Art is life, but it's also about how we plan and execute these murals to resonate with communities.

>>Historian: That's true! Graffiti has always been a reflection of society. Take ancient Rome, for example—political scribbles on walls were common. Today’s vibrant murals continue this tradition by commenting on societal norms and changes. Remember the Berlin Wall? It was covered in graffiti that captured the spirit of resistance and hope during its time.

>>Sociologist: Exactly! Graffiti can transform neglected areas into vibrant spaces, fostering pride among residents. I've seen neighborhoods rally around new murals, using them as symbols of community identity and struggle. How do you think different communities react to street art?

>>Street Artist: When I paint a mural, it's like leaving a piece of my soul on the wall. But beyond colors or design, it's about creating something that resonates with people and makes them feel connected to their surroundings. Have you noticed how some murals become landmarks over time?

>>Historian: Absolutely! And speaking of landmarks, graffiti has often been a silent witness to history's unfolding events—from Roman political dissent etched on walls to modern social movements' vibrant expressions—it serves as testament shaping societies' voices across generations.

>>Sociologist: Graffiti can be such a powerful tool for social change—a canvas expressing communities' identities and struggles—fostering belonging when people see their stories reflected in art.

>>Legal Expert: Legally speaking, graffiti is often classified as vandalism without permission, which can lead to fines or even imprisonment due to property rights issues. But imagine if cities designated areas for street art; it could balance artistic freedom with legal boundaries while respecting community spaces.

>>Urban Planner: Integrating street art into urban planning is crucial—it’s like weaving culture into community fabric. Designated spaces for murals don't just beautify an area; they create dialogue between city planners and residents.

>>Street Artist: You know when I see graffiti? It's more than just shouting out to the world—it's starting conversations! Those vibrant colors invite everyone to engage with their environment differently.

>>Historian: And interestingly enough, those conversations have historical roots too—from ancient political dissent to modern-day movements—they've shaped societies’ voices across generations.

>>Sociologist: Right! And when communities embrace street art, it often leads to increased engagement among residents who feel proud seeing their narratives depicted visually."
