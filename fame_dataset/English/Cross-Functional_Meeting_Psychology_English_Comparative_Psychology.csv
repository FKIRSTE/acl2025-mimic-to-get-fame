Comparative Psychology,"Comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals[clarification needed], especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. The phrase comparative psychology may be employed in either a narrow or a broad meaning.[1] In its narrow meaning, it refers to the study of the
similarities and differences in the psychology and behavior of different species. In a broader meaning, comparative psychology includes comparisons between different biological and socio-cultural groups, such as species, sexes, developmental stages, ages, and ethnicities. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species, from insects to primates.[2][3]

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both proximate and ultimate causation.[4]

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen.[5] First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see Tinbergen's four questions.

The 9th century scholar al-Jahiz wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants.[6] The 11th century Arabic writer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals, an early treatise dealing with the effects of music on animals. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or slowed with the use of music, and shows other examples of how music can affect animal behavior, experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.[7]

Charles Darwin was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of ""pre-"" and ""post-Darwin"" because his contributions were so influential. Darwin's theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the ""anecdotal movement"" led by George Romanes who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a ""rudimentary human mind"".[4] Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism.[2]

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the ""first experimental biologist"",[4] and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be ""the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word"".[4]

Although the field initially attempted to include a variety of species, by the early 1950s it had focused primarily on the white lab rat and the pigeon, and the topic of study was restricted to learning, usually in mazes. This stunted state of affairs was pointed out by Beach (1950)[8] and although it was generally agreed with, no real change took place. He repeated the charges a decade later, again with no results. In the meantime, in Europe, ethology was making strides in studying a multitude of species and a plethora of behaviors. There was friction between the two disciplines where there should have been cooperation, but comparative psychologists refused, for the most part, to broaden their horizons. This state of affairs ended with the triumph of ethology over comparative psychology, culminating in the Nobel Prize being given to ethologists, combined with a flood of informative books and television programs on ethological studies that came to be widely seen and read in the United States.[9] At present, comparative psychology in the United States is moribund.[10]

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term ""comparative psychology"" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare.[2] However, the definition of ""intelligence"" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism; experiments focused on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation were plagued with practical and theoretical problems.[2] In the literature, ""intelligence"" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. echolocation).[11] Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).[2]

A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. Ivan Pavlov's early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. Thorndike began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical rat, which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of pigeons, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of primate; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by Harry F. Harlow's studies of maternal deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg[12] (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named Gua was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended nine months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee Washoe 350 words in American Sign Language. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, Loulis. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just been based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated.[13][14][15] All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be intelligent have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of corvid, parrots—especially the grey parrot—and dolphins. Alex (Avian Learning Experiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg,[16] who found that the African gray parrot Alex did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid[17] found that a Border Collie named Chaser was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

Researchers who study animal cognition are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans. For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and animal cognition are heavily overlapping research categories.[18][19][20]

Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.[21]

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or pet animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation.[22] These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases.[23] For example, rats who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human psychosis, like biting their owners.[citation needed]

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the breed as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, huskies have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity.[24] Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.[25]

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on ethological studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.[citation needed]

The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. Domestication has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.[26]

Ingold [27] remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as ""not people"", and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: ""Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals."" With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who is not—that is, the outsider.

The New York Times ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals,[28] more specifically of children with their pets. It has been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, ""It made the children more cooperative and sharing."" It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of Social Science and Medicine it was stated, ""A random survey of 339 residents from Perth, Western Australia were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales.""[29] Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

I'm excited to see what insights we can uncover today. Let's start by outlining our objectives for this meeting. We'll be focusing on the comparative analysis of animal behavior across different species—why they do what they do.
>>Ethologist: Great point about proximate causes; let's also consider how their environment affects their actions.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Building on that, we should explore why these behaviors have evolved over time.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: Absolutely, and from my perspective, understanding how their minds influence what they do is key. 
 >>Comparative Psychologist: You know, cross-species comparisons can reveal fascinating insights into both proximate and ultimate causation. For instance, the problem-solving abilities of corvids and primates are shaped by their ecological niches. Have you seen how crows use tools to get food? It's incredible.
>>Ethologist: Absolutely! And these abilities aren't just shaped by their ecological niches but also by their evolutionary history. Like how chimpanzees use sticks to fish for termites. These skills are crucial for survival and reproduction in the wild.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: From an evolutionary perspective, these problem-solving abilities have developed because they help animals overcome survival challenges. Over time, behaviors that enhance survival often lead to greater reproductive success.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: It's fascinating how these mental processes evolve. Corvids and primates exhibit remarkable problem-solving skills tailored to their environments. For example, ravens can solve puzzles that require multiple steps to access food.
>>Comparative Psychologist: Indeed! The dual influence of phylogenetic history and adaptive significance is key here. Understanding how immediate mechanisms drive behavior while considering evolutionary reasons behind them is crucial.
>>Ethologist: Exactly! In the wild, these problem-solving abilities are not just about survival but also about reproductive success. Behaviors that enhance survival often lead to greater reproductive success.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Moreover, from an evolutionary standpoint, behaviors that enhance survival often lead to greater reproductive success. How has this evolved over time?
>>Animal Cognition Expert: Well, Donald Dewsbury's principles on proximate and ultimate causation provide a framework for understanding these behaviors. Proximate causation looks at the immediate mechanisms behind problem-solving abilities, while ultimate causation considers the evolutionary reasons why these abilities have developed.
>>Comparative Psychologist: Absolutely! Dewsbury's principles help us understand how immediate mechanisms drive behavior while considering evolutionary reasons behind them.
>>Ethologist: I guess in the wild, these problem-solving abilities are crucial for navigating complex environments and securing resources.

Based on the feedback below, please revise the scene to make it more realistic and human-like:

1. **Issue Description:** Repetitive content and phrasing.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue repeatedly mentions the same concepts (problem-solving abilities, ecological niches, survival, reproductive success) without adding new information or perspectives. This redundancy can make the conversation feel unnatural and forced.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce new insights or examples to diversify the discussion. For instance, each speaker could provide specific examples of problem-solving behaviors in corvids and primates or discuss different aspects of adaptive significance.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language.
   **Reasoning:** The language used is highly academic and lacks the casual tone often found in real-life meetings. Phrases like ""adaptive significance"" and ""proximate causation"" are repeated verbatim without variation, which feels scripted.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Use more conversational language and vary the terminology to make the dialogue sound more natural. For example: ""How do these problem-solving skills help them survive?"" instead of ""What does this mean for our understanding of adaptive significance?""

3. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction dynamics.
   **Reasoning:** The speakers do not engage with each other's points in a meaningful way; they simply echo similar ideas without building on them or challenging them. Realistic meetings often involve more dynamic interactions, including questions, disagreements, or elaborations on previous points.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Encourage more interactive dialogue by having speakers ask follow-up questions, provide counterpoints, or share personal observations related to the topic.

4. **Issue Description:** Unnatural transitions between speakers.
   **Reasoning:** Each speaker's turn ends with a question that feels forced and repetitive (""What does this mean for our understanding...?"", ""How has this evolved over time?""). This pattern disrupts the flow of conversation and makes it seem less spontaneous.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Allow transitions to occur more organically by having speakers respond directly to each other’s statements rather than ending with a question every time.

5. **Issue Description:** Excessive use of technical jargon without explanation.
   **Reasoning:** Terms like ""phylogenetic history,"" ""proximate causation,"" and ""ultimate causation"" are used frequently but not explained in simpler terms for clarity. In realistic meetings, participants often clarify complex concepts for better understanding among all attendees.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include brief explanations or analogies when introducing technical jargon to ensure all participants can follow along easily.

6. **Issue Description:** Lack of specific examples or case studies.
   **Reasoning:** The discussion remains abstract without concrete examples that illustrate the points being made about problem-solving abilities in corvids and primates.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Incorporate specific examples or case studies that highlight particular behaviors observed in these species to make the conversation more engaging and informative.

By addressing these issues

<final_scene>
>>Comparative Psychologist: You know what’s really interesting? When we compare different species' problem-solving skills—like crows using tools—it gives us great insights into why they behave certain ways based on their environment needs as well as their evolution over time!
>>Ethologist: Right! And it's not just about where they live now but also how they've adapted through history—like chimps using sticks for termite fishing because it helps them survive better out there!
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Exactly! These skills didn't just pop up overnight—they evolved because they helped animals deal with tough situations so they could survive longer—and ultimately reproduce more successfully too!
>>Animal Cognition Expert: Totally fascinating stuff! Ravens solving multi-step puzzles shows just how smart some birds can be when faced with tricky problems—they’ve really honed those mental processes thanks largely due both historical adaptations plus current environmental demands!
>>Comparative Psychologist: Yes indeed—the combination between what they've inherited genetically plus what they've learned from living day-to-day really shapes those clever behaviors we see today!
>>Ethologist: And don’t forget—in nature—it’s not only surviving that's important—but also finding ways ensuring next generation comes along successfully too—that’s where smarter strategies come into play big-time! 
 >>Comparative Psychologist: Um, Tinbergen's framework provides a comprehensive approach to understanding animal behavior. Let's consider how reproductive mechanisms impact survival across different species.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: That's an interesting point! How have these mechanisms evolved over time? Some species have developed unique mating rituals or parental care strategies that enhance survival chances.
>>Ethologist: Exactly! In the wild, certain animals exhibit elaborate behaviors that help them reproduce successfully—like those intricate mating dances we see in birds!
>>Animal Cognition Expert: Moreover, um, from a cognitive standpoint, some species show impressive problem-solving skills when securing mates or caring for young ones. What does this tell us about animal intelligence?
>>Comparative Psychologist: It's fascinating how these behaviors vary across species—take peacocks' courtship displays for instance; they really showcase genetic fitness!
>>Ethologist: Absolutely! These behaviors aren't just about surviving but also about ensuring successful reproduction—
>>Animal Cognition Expert (interrupting): Sorry—could you clarify what you mean by optimizing reproductive success? Are we talking purely about genetics here?
>>Ethologist: Great question! It's not just genetics; it's also behavioral adaptations that improve mating chances and offspring care—a mix of factors working together.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Indeed! The adaptive significance of these behaviors is crucial. Elaborate courtship displays not only attract mates but also signal genetic health. How has this evolved over time?
>>Comparative Psychologist: Tinbergen's framework allows us to delve into the intricacies of animal behavior from multiple angles. Let's consider individual development across species. Developmental stages can significantly influence survival strategies and successful mating. 
 >>Animal Cognition Expert: Defining intelligence across species is tricky. We often fall into the trap of anthropomorphism, assuming human-like traits in animals. Are we truly measuring their cognitive abilities or just projecting our own biases?

>>Ethologist: Anthropomorphism can definitely skew our understanding. Animals develop cognitive abilities tailored to their environments. For example, dolphins' echolocation is an amazing adaptation that we might overlook if we're only looking for human-like traits.

>>Comparative Psychologist: Absolutely! When studying tool use in crows, we need to be careful not to interpret their actions through a human lens but understand them within their ecological context. This helps us appreciate the unique cognitive adaptations these animals have developed.

>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Right! These abilities are crucial for survival. Dolphins' echolocation and crows' tool use aren't just fascinating behaviors; they're essential adaptations for living in their environments.

>>Comparative Psychologist: That's a good point! If we project human-like traits onto animals, we risk misinterpreting their behaviors. Dolphins' complex social interactions might seem like human friendships, but they serve different purposes ecologically.

>>Ethologist: Exactly! Parrots' mimicry isn't just quirky; it's an adaptation for communication in dense forests where visibility is limited.

>>Comparative Psychologist: And conducting experiments with different species has its challenges. Testing dolphins in water is very different from testing dogs or parrots on land. Each species needs specific methods to accurately assess their cognitive abilities.

>>Ethologist: We also need to consider how our methodologies impact the results. Dolphins' echolocation and parrots' mimicry are shaped by their surroundings and should be studied within that context.

>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Absolutely! Anthropomorphism can affect how we interpret animal intelligence too. Dogs understanding human commands is often seen as high intelligence, but it's really an adaptation to living closely with humans.

>>Animal Cognition Expert: So each species has unique cognitive adaptations that require specific approaches for accurate assessment. Studying dolphins requires different methods than studying dogs or parrots.

>>Ethologist: Right! And considering ecological contexts highlights how these behaviors are shaped by their environments and should be studied accordingly. 
 >>Comparative Psychologist: You know, one potential joint project could involve studying the effects of urbanization on animal behavior. How do different species adapt to city environments? This could provide valuable insights into their stress responses and coping mechanisms.

>>Evolutionary Psychologist: That's a great idea! We could also look at how these adaptations might differ across species with varying evolutionary histories. For instance, birds might show different nesting habits compared to mammals like raccoons.

>>Ethologist: Absolutely, and we should consider how these behaviors impact ecological interactions within urban settings. Observing raccoons navigating city landscapes could reveal their survival strategies in altered habitats.

>>Animal Cognition Expert: From a cognitive perspective, it would be fascinating to study problem-solving abilities in these animals. Squirrels finding food sources in city parks might demonstrate their mental flexibility.

>>Comparative Psychologist: Right! From a comparative perspective—

>>Ethologist (interrupting): Hey, do we have any existing data on raccoon behavior in cities that we can reference?

>>Comparative Psychologist: Good question! Yeah, there are several studies out there that have documented raccoon behavior extensively. We can definitely use those as a starting point for our project. 
 >>Animal Cognition Expert: Okay, but what about the data integration? How do we ensure that all departments are on the same page and can access and utilize this information effectively?
>>Ethologist: Yes, that's crucial! From an ecological standpoint, we need a system that supports diverse needs across departments to enhance collaboration.
>>Comparative Psychologist: Absolutely! To ensure effective data integration, we must consider the cognitive load on each department. Systems designed with user-friendly interfaces and clear data visualization tools can significantly reduce errors and improve teamwork.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Right, but how do we make sure it's adaptable to varying needs? Flexibility is essential for our success here.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: I guess one way to tackle this is by implementing modular systems that allow customization based on departmental needs. This could help in addressing specific challenges without overwhelming everyone with unnecessary features.
>>Ethologist: Exactly! And having a system that can handle different types of data efficiently will significantly enhance our collaborative efforts.
>>Comparative Psychologist: Additionally, we could look into specific tools that have worked well in other organizations for reducing errors. Clear protocols for data sharing can also minimize misunderstandings.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Hmm... while adaptability is crucial, we should also think about potential challenges each department might face with new systems based on their current workflows.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: You know, it might be helpful if we conduct a pilot test with one department first before rolling out the system company-wide. This way, we can identify any issues early on and make necessary adjustments.
>>Ethologist: That's a great idea! It would allow us to see how well the system supports different needs in real-time scenarios without causing major disruptions. 
 >>Comparative Psychologist: Let's talk about how psychological states affect animal health. When animals don't get enough stimulation, they can start showing weird behaviors—like dogs tearing up stuff when they're bored.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: That's a good point! How do you think this plays out in different species? From an evolutionary angle, not getting enough stimulation can mess with their survival and reproduction. How did this come about over time?
>>Ethologist: It's fascinating because in nature, animals do all sorts of things that are vital for them. If they can't do these things, they get stressed out and act up. For example, wild animals engage in complex activities crucial for their survival. Restricting these activities leads to significant stress and behavioral issues.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: Exactly! And adding to what you've said, cognitively speaking, lack of stimulation really stresses animals out. Like parrots might start plucking their feathers if they're bored. What does this mean for our approach to animal care?
>>Comparative Psychologist: It means we need to ensure environments that provide adequate stimulation for all species. Behaviorally speaking, the lack of appropriate stimulation can lead to significant stress and even physical health issues in animals.
>>Ethologist: Yeah! In the wild, animals engage in a variety of activities crucial for their survival and reproduction. When these activities are restricted or absent, it leads to significant stress and behavioral issues.
>>Evolutionary Psychologist: Indeed! From an evolutionary perspective, the lack of appropriate stimulation in animals leads to behaviors that are not only maladaptive but also detrimental to their overall health and survival.
>>Animal Cognition Expert: So true... cognitive stress resulting from lack of stimulation leads to repetitive yet harmful behaviors too. Like parrots plucking feathers excessively when understimulated—akin to self-harm in humans! 
 >>John (Evolutionary Psychologist): From an evolutionary perspective, providing adequate stimulation is crucial. This aligns with our project goals to create environments that meet these needs. What do you all think are the key points we should focus on?
>>Sarah (Comparative Psychologist): I agree, especially when it comes to integrating findings from different species and environments. How can we best approach this?
>>Mike (Ethologist): Good point! We should also consider adapting these environments for different species' needs. Any thoughts on specific actions we should take?
>>Emma (Animal Cognition Expert): Yes, ensuring mental stimulation is vital too. Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas now before planning another meeting?
>>Sarah (Comparative Psychologist): To summarize, creating environments that cater to the stimulation needs of various species is important. We need to ensure our follow-up meetings address integrating findings from different species and environments."
