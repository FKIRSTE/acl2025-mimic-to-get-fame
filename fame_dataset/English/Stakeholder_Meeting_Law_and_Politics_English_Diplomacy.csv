Diplomacy,"

Diplomacy is the communication by representatives of state, intergovernmental, or non-governmental institutions intended to influence events in the international system.[1][2]

Diplomacy is the main instrument of foreign policy which represents the broader goals and strategies that guide a state's interactions with the rest of the world. International treaties, agreements, alliances, and other manifestations of international relations are usually the result of diplomatic negotiations and processes. Diplomats may also help shape a state by advising government officials.

Modern diplomatic methods, practices, and principles originated largely from 17th-century European customs. Beginning in the early 20th century, diplomacy became professionalized; the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ratified by most of the world's sovereign states, provides a framework for diplomatic procedures, methods, and conduct. Most diplomacy is now conducted by accredited officials, such as envoys and ambassadors, through a dedicated foreign affairs office. Diplomats operate through diplomatic missions, most commonly consulates and embassies, and rely on a number of support staff; the term diplomat is thus sometimes applied broadly to diplomatic and consular personnel and foreign ministry officials.[3]

The term diplomacy is derived from the 18th-century French term diplomate (""diplomat"" or ""diplomatist""), based on the ancient Greek diplōma, which roughly means ""an object folded in two"".[4] This reflected the practice of sovereigns providing a folded document to confer some official privilege; prior to the invention of the envelope, folding a document served to protect the privacy of its content. The term was later applied to all official documents, such as those containing agreements between governments, and thus became identified with international relations. This established history has in recent years been criticized by scholars pointing out how the term originates in the political context of the French Revolution.[5][6][additional citation(s) needed]

Some of the earliest known diplomatic records are the Amarna letters written between the pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt and the Amurru rulers of Canaan during the 14th century BC. Peace treaties were concluded between the Mesopotamian city-states of Lagash and Umma around approximately 2100 BC. Following the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC during the nineteenth dynasty, the pharaoh of Egypt and the ruler of the Hittite Empire created one of the first known international peace treaties, which survives in stone tablet fragments, now generally called the Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty.[citation needed]

The ancient Greek city-states on some occasions dispatched envoys to negotiate specific issues, such as war and peace or commercial relations, but did not have diplomatic representatives regularly posted in each other's territory. However, some of the functions given to modern diplomatic representatives were fulfilled by a proxenos, a citizen of the host city who had friendly relations with another city, often through familial ties. In times of peace, diplomacy was even conducted with non-Hellenistic rivals such as the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, though it was ultimately conquered by Alexander the Great of Macedon. Alexander was also adept at diplomacy, realizing that the conquest of foreign cultures would be better achieved by having his Macedonian and Greek subjects intermingle and intermarry with native populations. For instance, Alexander took as his wife a Sogdian woman of Bactria, Roxana, after the siege of the Sogdian Rock, in order to placate the rebelling populace. Diplomacy remained a necessary tool of statecraft for the great Hellenistic states that succeeded Alexander's empire, such as the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, which fought several wars in the Near East and often negotiated peace treaties through marriage alliances.[citation needed]

Relations with the Ottoman Empire were particularly important to Italian states, to which the Ottoman government was known as the Sublime Porte.[7] The maritime republics of Genoa and Venice depended less and less upon their nautical capabilities, and more and more upon the perpetuation of good relations with the Ottomans.[7] Interactions between various merchants, diplomats and clergymen hailing from the Italian and Ottoman empires helped inaugurate and create new forms of diplomacy and statecraft. Eventually the primary purpose of a diplomat, which was originally a negotiator, evolved into a persona that represented an autonomous state in all aspects of political affairs. It became evident that all other sovereigns felt the need to accommodate themselves diplomatically, due to the emergence of the powerful political environment of the Ottoman Empire.[7] One could come to the conclusion that the atmosphere of diplomacy within the early modern period revolved around a foundation of conformity to Ottoman culture.[citation needed]

One of the earliest realists in international relations theory was the 6th-century BC military strategist Sun Tzu (d. 496 BC), author of The Art of War. He lived during a time in which rival states were starting to pay less attention to traditional respects of tutelage to the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC) figurehead monarchs while each vied for power and total conquest. However, a great deal of diplomacy in establishing allies, bartering land, and signing peace treaties was necessary for each warring state, and the idealized role of the ""persuader/diplomat"" developed.[8]

From the Battle of Baideng (200 BC) to the Battle of Mayi (133 BC), the Han dynasty was forced to uphold a marriage alliance and pay an exorbitant amount of tribute (in silk, cloth, grain, and other foodstuffs) to the powerful northern nomadic Xiongnu that had been consolidated by Modu Shanyu. After the Xiongnu sent word to Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157) that they controlled areas stretching from Manchuria to the Tarim Basin oasis city-states, a treaty was drafted in 162 BC proclaiming that everything north of the Great Wall belongs to nomads' lands, while everything south of it would be reserved for Han Chinese. The treaty was renewed no less than nine times but did not restrain some Xiongnu tuqi from raiding Han borders. That was until the far-flung campaigns of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) which shattered the unity of the Xiongnu and allowed Han to conquer the Western Regions; under Wu, in 104 BC the Han armies ventured as far Fergana in Central Asia to battle the Yuezhi who had conquered Hellenistic Greek areas.[citation needed]

The Koreans and Japanese during the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) looked to the Chinese capital of Chang'an as the hub of civilization and emulated its central bureaucracy as the model of governance. The Japanese sent frequent embassies to China in this period, although they halted these trips in 894 when the Tang seemed on the brink of collapse. After the devastating An Shi Rebellion from 755 to 763, the Tang dynasty was in no position to reconquer Central Asia and the Tarim Basin. After several conflicts with the Tibetan Empire spanning several different decades, the Tang finally made a truce and signed a peace treaty with them in 841.[citation needed]

In the 11th century during the Song dynasty (960–1279), there were shrewd ambassadors such as Shen Kuo and Su Song who achieved diplomatic success with the Liao dynasty, the often hostile Khitan neighbor to the north. Both diplomats secured the rightful borders of the Song dynasty through knowledge of cartography and dredging up old court archives. There was also a triad of warfare and diplomacy between these two states and the Tangut Western Xia dynasty to the northwest of Song China (centered in modern-day Shaanxi). After warring with the Lý dynasty of Vietnam from 1075 to 1077, Song and Lý made a peace agreement in 1082 to exchange the respective lands they had captured from each other during the war.[citation needed]

Long before the Tang and Song dynasties, the Chinese had sent envoys into Central Asia, India, and Persia, starting with Zhang Qian in the 2nd century BC. Another notable event in Chinese diplomacy was the Chinese embassy mission of Zhou Daguan to the Khmer Empire of Cambodia in the 13th century. Chinese diplomacy was a necessity in the distinctive period of Chinese exploration. Since the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), the Chinese also became heavily invested in sending diplomatic envoys abroad on maritime missions into the Indian Ocean, to India, Persia, Arabia, East Africa, and Egypt. Chinese maritime activity increased dramatically during the commercialized period of the Song dynasty, with new nautical technologies, many more private ship owners, and an increasing amount of economic investors in overseas ventures.[citation needed]

During the Mongol Empire (1206–1294) the Mongols created something similar to today's diplomatic passport called paiza. The paiza was in three different types (golden, silver, and copper) depending on the envoy's level of importance. With the paiza, there came authority that the envoy could ask for food, transport, and a place to stay from any city, village, or clan within the empire with no difficulties.[citation needed]

In the 17th century, the Qing dynasty concluded a series of treaties with Czarist Russia, beginning with the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689. This was followed up by the Aigun Treaty and the Convention of Peking in the mid-19th century.[citation needed]

As European power spread around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries so too did its diplomatic model, and Asian countries adopted syncretic or European diplomatic systems. For example, as part of diplomatic negotiations with the West over control of land and trade in China in the 19th century after the First Opium War, the Chinese diplomat Qiying gifted intimate portraits of himself to representatives from Italy, England, the United States, and France.[9]

Ancient India, with its kingdoms and dynasties, had a long tradition of diplomacy. The oldest treatise on statecraft and diplomacy, Arthashastra, is attributed to Kautilya (also known as Chanakya), who was the principal adviser to Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya dynasty who ruled in the 3rd century BC. It incorporates a theory of diplomacy, of how in a situation of mutually contesting kingdoms, the wise king builds alliances and tries to checkmate his adversaries. The envoys sent at the time to the courts of other kingdoms tended to reside for extended periods of time, and Arthashastra contains advice on the deportment of the envoy, including the trenchant suggestion that ""he should sleep alone"". The highest morality for the king is that his kingdom should prosper.[10]

A new analysis of Arthashastra brings out that hidden inside the 6,000 aphorisms of prose (sutras) are pioneering political and philosophic concepts. It covers the internal and external spheres of statecraft, politics and administration. The normative element is the political unification of the geopolitical and cultural subcontinent of India. This work comprehensively studies state governance; it urges non-injury to living creatures, or malice, as well as compassion, forbearance, truthfulness, and uprightness. It presents a rajmandala (grouping of states), a model that places the home state surrounded by twelve competing entities which can either be potential adversaries or latent allies, depending on how relations with them are managed. This is the essence of realpolitik. It also offers four upaya (policy approaches): conciliation, gifts, rupture or dissent, and force. It counsels that war is the last resort, as its outcome is always uncertain. This is the first expression of the raison d'etat doctrine, as also of humanitarian law; that conquered people must be treated fairly, and assimilated.[citation needed]

The key challenge to the Byzantine Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its sundry neighbors, including the Georgians, Iberians, the Germanic peoples, the Bulgars, the Slavs, the Armenians, the Huns, the Avars, the Franks, the Lombards, and the Arabs, that embodied and so maintained its imperial status. All these neighbors lacked a key resource that Byzantium had taken over from Rome, namely a formalized legal structure. When they set about forging formal political institutions, they were dependent on the empire. Whereas classical writers are fond of making a sharp distinction between peace and war, for the Byzantines diplomacy was a form of war by other means. With a regular army of 120,000–140,000 men after the losses of the 7th century,[11][12] the empire's security depended on activist diplomacy.[citation needed]

Byzantium's ""Bureau of Barbarians"" was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire's rivals from every imaginable source.[13] While on the surface a protocol office—its main duty was to ensure foreign envoys were properly cared for and received sufficient state funds for their maintenance, and it kept all the official translators—it clearly had a security function as well. On Strategy, from the 6th century, offers advice about foreign embassies: ""[Envoys] who are sent to us should be received honorably and generously, for everyone holds envoys in high esteem. Their attendants, however, should be kept under surveillance to keep them from obtaining any information by asking questions of our people.""[14]

In Europe, early modern diplomacy's origins are often traced to the states of Northern Italy in the early Renaissance, with the first embassies being established in the 13th century.[15] Milan played a leading role, especially under Francesco Sforza who established permanent embassies to the other city-states of Northern Italy. Tuscany and Venice were also flourishing centers of diplomacy from the 14th century onward. It was in the Italian Peninsula that many of the traditions of modern diplomacy began, such as the presentation of an ambassador's credentials to the head of state.[citation needed]

From Italy, the practice was spread across Europe. Milan was the first to send a representative to the court of France in 1455. However, Milan refused to host French representatives, fearing they would conduct espionage and intervene in its internal affairs. As foreign powers such as France and Spain became increasingly involved in Italian politics the need to accept emissaries was recognized. Soon the major European powers were exchanging representatives. Spain was the first to send a permanent representative; it appointed an ambassador to the Court of St. James's (i.e. England) in 1487. By the late 16th century, permanent missions became customary. The Holy Roman Emperor, however, did not regularly send permanent legates, as they could not represent the interests of all the German princes (who were in theory all subordinate to the Emperor, but in practice each independent).

Between 1500 and 1700, the rules of modern diplomacy were further developed.[16] French replaced Latin from about 1715. The top rank of representatives was an ambassador. At that time an ambassador was a nobleman, the rank of the noble assigned varying with the prestige of the country he was delegated to. Strict standards were developed for ambassadors, requiring them to have large residences, host lavish parties, and play an important role in the court life of their host nation. In Rome, the most prized posting for a Catholic ambassador, the French and Spanish representatives would have a retinue of up to a hundred. Even in smaller posts, ambassadors were very expensive. Smaller states would send and receive envoys, who were a rung below the ambassador. Somewhere between the two was the position of minister plenipotentiary.

Diplomacy was a complex affair, even more so than now. The ambassadors from each state were ranked by complex levels of precedence that were much disputed. States were normally ranked by the title of the sovereign; for Catholic nations the emissary from the Vatican was paramount, then those from the kingdoms, then those from duchies and principalities. Representatives from republics were ranked the lowest (which often angered the leaders of the numerous German, Scandinavian, and Italian republics). Determining precedence between two kingdoms depended on a number of factors that often fluctuated, leading to near-constant squabbling.

Ambassadors were often nobles with little foreign experience and no expectation of a career in diplomacy. They were supported by their embassy staff. These professionals would be sent on longer assignments and would be far more knowledgeable than the higher-ranking officials about the host country. Embassy staff would include a wide range of employees, including some dedicated to espionage. The need for skilled individuals to staff embassies was met by the graduates of universities, and this led to a great increase in the study of international law, French, and history at universities throughout Europe.

At the same time, permanent foreign ministries began to be established in almost all European states to coordinate embassies and their staffs. These ministries were still far from their modern form, and many of them had extraneous internal responsibilities. Britain had two departments with frequently overlapping powers until 1782. They were also far smaller than they are currently. France, which boasted the largest foreign affairs department, had only some 70 full-time employees in the 1780s.

The elements of modern diplomacy slowly spread to Eastern Europe and Russia, arriving by the early 18th century. The entire edifice would be greatly disrupted by the French Revolution and the subsequent years of warfare. The revolution would see commoners take over the diplomacy of the French state, and of those conquered by revolutionary armies. Ranks of precedence were abolished. Napoleon also refused to acknowledge diplomatic immunity, imprisoning several British diplomats accused of scheming against France.

After the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 established an international system of diplomatic rank. Disputes on precedence among nations (and therefore the appropriate diplomatic ranks used) were first addressed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, but persisted for over a century until after World War II, when the rank of ambassador became the norm. In between that time, figures such as the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck were renowned for international diplomacy.

Diplomats and historians often refer to a foreign ministry by its address: the Ballhausplatz (Vienna), the Quai d'Orsay (Paris), the Wilhelmstrasse (Berlin), Itamaraty (Brasília), and Foggy Bottom (Washington, D.C.). For the Russian foreign ministry, it was the Choristers' Bridge (Saint Petersburg) until 1917, while ""Consulta"" referred to the Italian foreign ministry, based in the Palazzo della Consulta (Rome) from 1874 to 1922.[18][19]

The sanctity of diplomats has long been observed, underpinning the modern concept of diplomatic immunity. While there have been a number of cases where diplomats have been killed, this is normally viewed as a great breach of honor. Genghis Khan and the Mongols were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often wreak horrific vengeance against any state that violated these rights.

Diplomatic rights were established in the mid-17th century in Europe and have spread throughout the world. These rights were formalized by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which protects diplomats from being persecuted or prosecuted while on a diplomatic mission. If a diplomat does commit a serious crime while in a host country, he or she may be declared as persona non grata (unwanted person). Such diplomats are then often tried for the crime in their homeland.

Diplomatic communications are also viewed as sacrosanct, and diplomats have long been allowed to carry documents across borders without being searched. The mechanism for this is the so-called ""diplomatic bag"" (or, in some countries, the ""diplomatic pouch""). While radio and digital communication have become more standard for embassies, diplomatic pouches are still quite common and some countries, including the United States, declare entire shipping containers as diplomatic pouches to bring sensitive material (often building supplies) into a country.[20]

In times of hostility, diplomats are often withdrawn for reasons of personal safety, as well as in some cases when the host country is friendly but there is a perceived threat from internal dissidents. Ambassadors and other diplomats are sometimes recalled temporarily by their home countries as a way to express displeasure with the host country. In both cases, lower-level employees still remain to actually do the business of diplomacy.

Diplomacy is closely linked to espionage or the gathering of intelligence. Embassies are bases for both diplomats and spies, and some diplomats are essentially openly acknowledged spies. For instance, the job of military attachés includes learning as much as possible about the military of the nation to which they are assigned. They do not try to hide this role and, as such, are only invited to events allowed by their hosts, such as military parades or air shows. There are also deep-cover spies operating in many embassies. These individuals are given fake positions at the embassy, but their main task is to illegally gather intelligence, usually by coordinating spy rings of locals or other spies. For the most part, spies operating out of embassies gather little intelligence themselves and their identities tend to be known by the opposition. If discovered, these diplomats can be expelled from an embassy, but for the most part counter-intelligence agencies prefer to keep these agents in situ and under close monitoring.

The information gathered by spies plays an increasingly important role in diplomacy. Arms-control treaties would be impossible without the power of reconnaissance satellites and agents to monitor compliance. Information gleaned from espionage is useful in almost all forms of diplomacy, everything from trade agreements to border disputes.

Various processes and procedures have evolved over time for handling diplomatic issues and disputes.

Nations sometimes resort to international arbitration when faced with a specific question or point of contention in need of resolution. For most of history, there were no official or formal procedures for such proceedings. They were generally accepted to abide by general principles and protocols related to international law and justice.[citation needed]

Sometimes these took the form of formal arbitrations and mediations. In such cases, a commission of diplomats might be convened to hear all sides of an issue and to come some sort of ruling based on international law.

In the modern era, much of this work is often carried out by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, or other formal commissions, agencies and tribunals, working under the United Nations. Below are some examples.

Other times, resolutions were sought through the convening of international conferences. In such cases, there are fewer ground rules and fewer formal applications of international law. However, participants are expected to guide themselves through principles of international fairness, logic, and protocol.[21]

Some examples of these formal conferences are:

Sometimes nations convene official negotiation processes to settle a specific dispute or specific issue between several nations which are parties to a dispute. These are similar to the conferences mentioned above, as there are technically no established rules or procedures. However, there are general principles and precedents which help define a course for such proceedings.[21]

Some examples are:

Small state diplomacy is receiving increasing attention in diplomatic studies and international relations. Small states are particularly affected by developments which are determined beyond their borders such as climate change, water security and shifts in the global economy. Diplomacy is the main vehicle by which small states are able to ensure that their goals are addressed in the global arena. These factors mean that small states have strong incentives to support international cooperation. But with limited resources at their disposal, conducting effective diplomacy poses unique challenges for small states.[22][23]

There are a variety of diplomatic categories and diplomatic strategies employed by organizations and governments to achieve their aims, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

Appeasement is a policy of making concessions to an aggressor in order to avoid confrontation; because of its failure to prevent World War 2, appeasement is not considered a legitimate tool of modern diplomacy. ""The theme that “appeasement in the face of tyranny never works and always leads to conflict eventually” is based on historical lessons.""[24]

Counterinsurgency diplomacy, or expeditionary diplomacy, developed by diplomats deployed to civil-military stabilization efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, employs diplomats at tactical and operational levels, outside traditional embassy environments and often alongside military or peacekeeping forces. Counterinsurgency diplomacy may provide political environment advice to local commanders, interact with local leaders, and facilitate the governance efforts, functions and reach of a host government.[25]

Debt-trap diplomacy is carried out in bilateral relations, with a powerful lending country seeking to saddle a borrowing nation with enormous debt so as to increase its leverage over it.[citation needed]

Economic diplomacy is the use of aid or other types of economic policy as a means to achieve a diplomatic agenda.[citation needed]

Gunboat diplomacy is the use of conspicuous displays of military power as a means of intimidation to influence others. Since it is inherently coercive, it typically lies near the edge between peace and war, and is usually exercised in the context of imperialism or hegemony.[26] An emblematic example is the Don Pacifico Incident in 1850, in which the United Kingdom blockaded the Greek port of Piraeus in retaliation for the harming of a British subject and the failure of the Greek government to provide him with restitution.

Hostage diplomacy is the taking of hostages by a state or quasi-state actor to fulfill diplomatic goals. It is a type of asymmetric diplomacy often used by weaker states to pressure stronger ones. Hostage diplomacy has been practiced from prehistory to the present day.[27][28]

Humanitarian diplomacy is the set of activities undertaken by various actors with governments, (para)military organizations, or personalities in order to intervene or push intervention in a context where humanity is in danger.[29] According to Antonio De Lauri, a research professor at the Chr. Michelsen Institute, humanitarian diplomacy ""ranges from negotiating the presence of humanitarian organizations to negotiating access to civilian populations in need of protection. It involves monitoring assistance programs, promoting respect for international law, and engaging in advocacy in support of broader humanitarian goals"".[30]

Migration diplomacy is the use of human migration in a state's foreign policy.[31] American political scientist Myron Weiner argued that international migration is intricately linked to states' international relations.[32] More recently, Kelly Greenhill has identified how states may employ 'weapons of mass migration' against target states in their foreign relations.[33] Migration diplomacy may involve the use of refugees,[34][35] labor migrants,[36][37] or diasporas[38] in states' pursuit of international diplomacy goals. In the context of the Syrian Civil War, Syrian refugees were used in the context of Jordanian, Lebanese, and Turkish migration diplomacy.[39][28]

Nuclear diplomacy is the area of diplomacy related to preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear war. One of the most well-known (and most controversial) philosophies of nuclear diplomacy is mutually assured destruction (MAD).[40][41]

Preventive diplomacy is carried out through quiet means (as opposed to ""gun-boat diplomacy"", which is backed by the threat of force, or ""public diplomacy"", which makes use of publicity). It is also understood that circumstances may exist in which the consensual use of force (notably preventive deployment) might be welcomed by parties to a conflict with a view to achieving the stabilization necessary for diplomacy and related political processes to proceed. This is to be distinguished from the use of ""persuasion"", ""suasion"", ""influence"", and other non-coercive approaches explored below.

Preventive diplomacy, in the view of one expert, is ""the range of peaceful dispute resolution approaches mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter [on the pacific settlement of disputes] when applied before a dispute crosses the threshold to armed conflict."" It may take many forms, with different means employed. One form of diplomacy which may be brought to bear to prevent violent conflict (or to prevent its recurrence) is ""quiet diplomacy"". When one speaks of the practice of quiet diplomacy, definitional clarity is largely absent. In part this is due to a lack of any comprehensive assessment of exactly what types of engagement qualify, and how such engagements are pursued. On the one hand, a survey of the literature reveals no precise understanding or terminology on the subject. On the other hand, concepts are neither clear nor discrete in practice. Multiple definitions are often invoked simultaneously by theorists, and the activities themselves often mix and overlap in practice.[42]

Public diplomacy is the exercise of influence through communication with the general public in another nation, rather than attempting to influence the nation's government directly. This communication may take the form of propaganda, or more benign forms such as citizen diplomacy, individual interactions between average citizens of two or more nations. Technological advances and the advent of digital diplomacy now allow instant communication with foreign citizens, and methods such as Facebook diplomacy and Twitter diplomacy are increasingly used by world leaders and diplomats.[23]

Also known as the ""softly softly"" approach, quiet diplomacy is the attempt to influence the behaviour of another state through secret negotiations or by refraining from taking a specific action.[43] This method is often employed by states that lack alternative means to influence the target government, or that seek to avoid certain outcomes. For example, South Africa is described as engaging in quiet diplomacy with neighboring Zimbabwe to avoid appearing as ""bullying"" and subsequently engendering a hostile response. This approach can also be employed by more powerful states: U.S. President George W. Bush's nonattendance at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development constituted a form of quiet diplomacy, in response to the lack of UN support for the U.S.' proposed invasion of Iraq.[citation needed]

Science diplomacy[44] is the use of scientific collaborations among nations to address common problems and to build constructive international partnerships. Many experts and groups use a variety of definitions for science diplomacy. However, science diplomacy has become an umbrella term to describe a number of formal or informal technical, research-based, academic or engineering exchanges, with notable examples including CERN, the International Space Station, and ITER.

Soft power, sometimes called ""hearts and minds diplomacy"", as defined by Joseph Nye, is the cultivation of relationships, respect, or even admiration from others in order to gain influence, as opposed to more coercive approaches. Often and incorrectly confused with the practice of official diplomacy, soft power refers to non-state, culturally attractive factors that may predispose people to sympathize with a foreign culture based on affinity for its products, such as the American entertainment industry, schools and music.[45] A country's soft power can come from three resources: its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).[citation needed] A particular example of soft power is the use of giant panda bears by China as a diplomatic gift, a practice known as panda diplomacy.

City diplomacy refers to cities using institutions and processes to engage relations with other actors on an international stage, with the aim of representing themselves and their interests to one another.[46] Especially today, city administrations and networks are increasingly active in the realm of transnationally relevant questions and issues ranging from the climate crisis to migration and the promotion of smart technology. As such, cities and city networks may seek to address and re-shape national and sub-national conflicts, support their peers in the achievement of sustainable development, and achieve certain levels of regional integration and solidarity among each other.[47] Whereas diplomacy pursued by nation-states is often said to be disconnected from the citizenry, city diplomacy fundamentally rests on its proximity to the latter and seeks to leverage these ties ""to build international strategies integrating both their values and interests.""[48]

Most countries provide professional training for their diplomats and maintain institutions specifically for that purpose. Private institutions also exist as do establishments associated with organizations like the European Union and the United Nations.

In early European diplomacy, a number of diplomatic 'manuals' were published, describing the legal aspects of early diplomacy as well as how diplomats should conduct themselves.[49] Some manuals, such as one by Étienne Dolet, were also targeted at rulers, helping them to understand the characteristics of a good diplomat.[49]

Diplomacy, as the primary instrument of foreign policy, involves communication by state representatives to influence global events. Historical origins trace back to 17th-century European customs, with modern practices formalized by the 1961 Vienna Convention. Diplomatic missions are conducted through consulates and embassies by accredited officials like envoys and ambassadors. The term 'diplomacy' derives from an 18th-century French word linked to official documents. Ancient diplomatic records include treaties from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. Diplomacy evolved significantly during interactions between Italian states and the Ottoman Empire in the early modern period. The Byzantine Empire utilized diplomacy as a form of war strategy, while early modern European diplomacy began in Northern Italy during the Renaissance. Permanent embassies became customary by the late 16th century, with complex precedence rules for ambassadors established post-Congress of Vienna (1815). Diplomatic immunity was formalized mid-17th century and protected under the Vienna Convention (1961). Modern diplomacy includes various strategies like economic diplomacy, gunboat diplomacy, humanitarian diplomacy, migration diplomacy, nuclear diplomacy, preventive diplomacy, public diplomacy, quiet diplomacy, science diplomacy, soft power, city diplomacy among others. Training for diplomats is provided by professional institutions globally.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting and Meeting Objectives\nTLDR: Participants greet each other and outline the meeting objectives.\n- Brief greeting among participants\n- Outline meeting objectives: Update on project progress, gather feedback, ensure alignment with expectations\n- Set the tone for collaborative discussion"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of Diplomacy\nTLDR: Historian provides an overview of the historical evolution of diplomacy.\n- Discuss origins of diplomacy in 17th-century Europe\n- Mention key historical treaties from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece\n- Highlight significant developments during Renaissance Italy and Ottoman Empire interactions"", ""Scene 3: Practical Application in Modern Diplomacy\nTLDR: Diplomat shares insights on modern diplomatic practices and their relevance.\n- Explain formalization by Vienna Convention (1961)\n- Discuss roles of consulates and embassies\n- Share personal experiences from international negotiations"", ""Scene 4: Analytical Insight into Diplomatic Strategies\nTLDR: Political Scientist analyzes various modern diplomatic strategies.\n- Overview of different types of diplomacy (economic, gunboat, humanitarian, etc.)\n- Use statistics and data references to support analysis\n- Encourage spontaneous contributions from other participants"", ""Scene 5: Strategic Insight on Foreign Policy Implications\nTLDR: Foreign Policy Analyst evaluates strategic implications of diplomatic practices.\n- Discuss impact on global events and foreign policy formulation\n- Evaluate effectiveness of different diplomatic strategies using case studies\n- Allow for natural disagreement and resolution among participants"", ""Scene 6: Gathering Stakeholder Feedback\nTLDR: Open floor for stakeholders to provide feedback on project progress.\n- Encourage stakeholders to share thoughts and concerns\n- Collect valuable feedback for future improvements\n- Ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations through discussion"", ""Scene 7: Off-topic Moments and Personal Experiences\nTLDR: Brief off-topic moments where participants share personal anecdotes related to diplomacy.\n- Share relevant personal experiences or stories related to diplomatic missions or negotiations\n- Foster a relaxed atmosphere for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 8: Conclusion and Next Steps\nTLDR: Summarize key points discussed and outline next steps.\n- Recap main discussion points from the meeting\n- Outline actionable next steps based on stakeholder feedback""]",">>Diplomat: Good morning, everyone. I hope you're all well. Let's start by outlining our objectives for today's meeting: updating on project progress, gathering feedback, and ensuring alignment with expectations.
>>Historian: Good morning. I agree with those goals and would like to add some historical context. Historically speaking, the evolution of diplomacy has always been about adapting to new challenges and opportunities.
>>Political Scientist: Morning, everyone. Those objectives align well with our current focus.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Can I add something here? We should also consider recent geopolitical shifts; it's crucial for our alignment.
>>Diplomat: Good call! Let's make sure we cover that as it directly impacts our project progress and strategic goals.
>>Political Scientist: Great addition! Now, considering the historical perspective on diplomacy adapting to new challenges, let's dive into how these geopolitical shifts are influencing our current projects. 
 >>Historian: You know, the origins of diplomacy can be traced back to ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia. They established treaties to maintain peace, with the Egyptian-Hittite peace treaty being one of the earliest examples. Moving forward to Renaissance Italy, we see the establishment of permanent embassies and sophisticated diplomatic practices. Interactions with the Ottoman Empire significantly shaped European customs and strategies.
>>Diplomat: Right, those interactions between Renaissance Italy and the Ottoman Empire were indeed pivotal. These exchanges influenced European diplomatic customs and led to the establishment of permanent embassies, which became a cornerstone of modern diplomacy. How did these early practices evolve into what we see today?
>>Historian: Well, in 17th-century Europe, diplomacy became more official through treaties like the Peace of Westphalia. This era marked a shift towards formalized international relations.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst (interrupting): Actually, you mentioned formalized international relations—could you clarify how those developments specifically impacted modern diplomatic protocols?
>>Historian: Certainly! The Peace of Westphalia made diplomacy more structured by establishing principles that are still relevant today. It marked a shift towards organized international relations.
>>Political Scientist: From a political standpoint, this professionalization laid the groundwork for modern practices. The 17th century solidified structured international relations further with permanent embassies and accredited officials.
>>Diplomat: Exactly! The Peace of Westphalia was significant in establishing principles still relevant today. But let's not overlook earlier treaties like those between Egypt and Mesopotamia—they set important precedents too. 
 >>Foreign Policy Analyst: The Vienna Convention was key in standardizing diplomatic practices. How do you think it affects today's consulates and embassies?

>>Historian: Diplomatic immunity has been around since ancient times, like in Egypt and Mesopotamia. What impact do you think these old practices have on modern diplomacy?

>>Diplomat: Yes, the Vienna Convention laid important groundwork. Permanent missions are vital for ongoing dialogue and mutual understanding.

>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! Continuous engagement helps prevent misunderstandings. But there are challenges with maintaining long-term missions in unstable regions.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, the roles of consulates and embassies have evolved significantly since their inception. The establishment of permanent missions during the Renaissance marked a shift from temporary envoys to enduring diplomatic presence. This evolution allowed for continuous dialogue between nations—crucial in addressing complex international issues effectively.

>>Diplomat: In my experience, permanent missions allow for deeper understanding between nations. This continuity is crucial in addressing complex international issues effectively.

>>Foreign Policy Analyst: It's interesting to consider how these historical developments influence current strategies. The stability provided by permanent missions is essential for long-term diplomacy.

>>Political Scientist: Exactly! Building relationships over time rather than just reacting to crises as they occur makes all the difference. 
 >>Foreign Policy Analyst: From a policy perspective, it's crucial to evaluate the implications of different diplomatic strategies. Economic diplomacy can foster long-term alliances through trade agreements and aid packages. But gunboat diplomacy, while effective in immediate coercion, often leads to lasting resentment and instability. How do we balance these approaches?
>>Historian: That's always been tricky historically. During European imperialism, nations used economic incentives to establish control over colonies while employing military force to maintain that control. The British Empire's dealings with India are a prime example—trade agreements backed by military presence. How can modern states learn from these historical examples to avoid resentment and instability?
>>Diplomat: We can definitely learn from history to avoid those mistakes. Combining economic aid with humanitarian projects helps build trust and long-term partnerships.
>>Political Scientist: And don't forget about public diplomacy—it’s crucial for shaping how countries see each other.
>>Historian: Like the Marshall Plan post-World War II—it aimed at economic recovery but also fostered goodwill across Europe. How might modern states replicate such comprehensive strategies to address current global challenges?
>>Political Scientist: Integrating humanitarian efforts into economic diplomacy is key. Preventive diplomacy also plays a role in stopping conflicts before they escalate. Data from the United Nations shows early intervention has successfully prevented numerous potential conflicts in regions like West Africa and Southeast Asia.
>>Historian: Preventive diplomacy has roots in ancient practices where early intervention was crucial for peacekeeping. The Amarna letters between Egypt and Canaan demonstrate how proactive communication helped avert conflicts. How might modern states utilize such historical precedents to enhance their preventive strategies?
>>Diplomat: Exactly! Modern states can leverage preventive diplomacy by integrating early intervention strategies with economic and humanitarian efforts.
>>Political Scientist: From a political standpoint, integrating preventive diplomacy with economic and humanitarian efforts is indeed crucial.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Effective communication strategies can significantly enhance diplomatic relations and reduce tensions.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, the Byzantine Empire's proactive diplomatic measures were instrumental in managing relations with neighboring states—marriage alliances and strategic treaties helped maintain stability and prevent conflicts. How might modern states adapt such historical strategies? 
 >>Foreign Policy Analyst: Modern states can definitely learn from the Byzantine Empire's use of marriage alliances, but we also need to think about how economic sanctions fit into today's world. How do we adapt these historical strategies to our current geopolitical challenges?
>>Diplomat: I agree with you. Balancing historical approaches with modern tools like economic sanctions and humanitarian aid is crucial. For example, look at how Germany has balanced economic sanctions with diplomatic engagement in recent years. What are some other examples of successful integration?
>>Historian: That's a good point about balancing strategies. The Byzantines also used intelligence gathering effectively through their 'Bureau of Barbarians.' How can modern states leverage similar methods in today's digital landscape where information flows instantaneously?
>>Political Scientist: We need to consider current geopolitical dynamics when integrating historical strategies. Take the case of Russia's use of cyber operations alongside traditional diplomacy—how do we ensure our approach remains adaptive and responsive to evolving global challenges?
>>Diplomat: Absolutely! To foster mutual understanding, modern states must leverage both historical strategies and contemporary tools. Integrating intelligence operations with digital diplomacy can enhance our ability to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes. How do we balance these approaches to ensure effective and adaptive foreign policy?
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Right! Considering the rapid pace at which information spreads today, how do we make sure that our strategies remain relevant and timely? It's not just about adopting old methods but adapting them effectively.
>>Political Scientist: Analyzing the policy implications means considering the dynamic nature of international relations today. Economic sanctions can be powerful tools, but their effectiveness hinges on strategic use of intelligence and diplomatic engagement to mitigate unintended consequences.
>>Historian: Exactly! Combining marriage alliances with intelligence operations was key for the Byzantines. But in today's digital age, how can modern states adapt these methods effectively?
>>Diplomat: Harmonizing historical strategies with modern diplomatic tools is essential. While intelligence operations were crucial for the Byzantines, today's digital diplomacy offers unique opportunities for transparency and trust-building.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Well said! And it's important that these approaches are not only effective but also ethically sound.
>>Political Scientist: Indeed! Balancing economic sanctions with humanitarian aid while leveraging intelligence is critical for avoiding unintended consequences. 
 >>Diplomat: To make sure we're all on the same page, let's hear everyone's thoughts and concerns. Your feedback is really important for guiding our next steps.
>>Historian: Historically speaking, gathering feedback has been crucial in shaping diplomatic strategies. For example, during events like the Congress of Vienna in 1815, diplomats collected and analyzed input from various European powers to ensure a balanced peace. How can we adapt such methods to our current strategies?
>>Political Scientist: Right, it's not just about gathering feedback but also making sure we use it in our decisions. How do you think we can make sure everyone's voice is heard and considered when we're forming policies?
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Good point. We need to figure out how to systematically include this feedback in our strategy. What mechanisms can we put in place to make sure it shapes our decisions effectively?
>>Diplomat: Sorry to cut you off—can you tell us exactly what methods they used at the Congress? That might help us figure out how we can apply them today.
>>Historian: Sure! During the Congress of Vienna, diplomats held lots of bilateral meetings and sent out detailed questionnaires among European powers. They also set up committees to analyze responses thoroughly before making any decisions.
>>Political Scientist: That's interesting! So if we were to implement similar methods now, maybe forming dedicated committees for analysis could be one way forward.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Absolutely, but we'd need to make sure these committees have representation from all key stakeholders for balanced decision-making. 
 >>Diplomat: You know, one of the most fascinating experiences I had was during a negotiation in Nairobi. We were working on a complex trade agreement that required balancing economic interests with environmental concerns. The discussions were intense, but through mutual respect and understanding, we managed to draft an agreement that addressed both sides effectively.
>>Historian: That's really interesting! It reminds me of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Those negotiations weren't just about redrawing borders; they were about establishing a balance of power to prevent future conflicts. It's amazing how those principles still influence diplomatic strategies today.
>>Political Scientist: Speaking of intense negotiations, I remember working on a security agreement in Brussels. We had to navigate national interests while ensuring collective security measures. It was challenging, but analytical insight and compromise helped us reach a solid agreement.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Actually, one of the toughest negotiations I participated in was in Tokyo for cybersecurity protocols. Balancing national security with international cooperation was no easy task. The data on cyber threats was overwhelming, but strategic collaboration made it possible to draft a comprehensive agreement.
>>Historian: You know, diplomacy can be like a delicate dance sometimes. The Congress of Vienna wasn't just about redrawing borders; it was also about creating stability and preventing future conflicts—a masterclass in balancing power dynamics that's still studied today.
>>Diplomat: That reminds me of my experience in Geneva negotiating a treaty involving multiple nations' interests. We had to address both economic development and environmental sustainability through mutual respect and understanding.
>>Political Scientist: Hmm...from my experience in Brussels negotiating that security agreement—it really highlighted how crucial analytical insight and compromise are when you're trying to balance national interests with collective security measures.
>>Foreign Policy Analyst: Interesting! You know—one unexpected diplomatic challenge I faced was during negotiations in Cairo for establishing a cultural exchange program. Balancing historical sensitivities with modern diplomatic goals required strategic insight and adaptability to navigate these delicate waters.

Based on the feedback below, please revise the scene to make it more realistic and human-like:

1. **Issue Description:** Repetition of similar experiences and phrases.
   **Reasoning:** Multiple characters describe their negotiation experiences in different cities using almost identical language, such as ""balancing interests,"" ""intense discussions,"" and ""drafting agreements."" This repetition feels unnatural because it lacks the diversity typically found in human conversations.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Vary the descriptions of each character's experiences to reflect unique aspects of their negotiations. For example, focus on specific challenges or memorable moments that differentiate each scenario.

2. **Issue Description:** Overly formal language and lack of conversational flow.
   **Reasoning:** The dialogue is highly structured and formal, which can feel unrealistic in a casual meeting setting where participants usually speak more naturally and interject with informal comments or questions.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Introduce more casual language, interruptions, and reactions to make the conversation feel more dynamic and authentic. For instance, add phrases like ""That reminds me..."" or ""I totally agree with you there.""

3. **Issue Description:** Historian's repeated references to the Congress of Vienna.
   **Reasoning:** The historian mentions the Congress of Vienna multiple times with very similar points, which seems redundant and unlikely in a real conversation where participants would avoid repeating themselves so closely.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Consolidate the historian's points about the Congress of Vienna into one comprehensive statement or vary the historical examples used to illustrate different aspects of diplomacy.

4. **Issue Description:** Lack of interaction between participants.
   **Reasoning:** Each character speaks independently without much acknowledgment or building upon what others have said, which is uncommon in real meetings where participants typically respond to each other's points.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Include interactions such as agreeing, questioning, or expanding on previous statements to create a more engaging dialogue. For example: ""That's an interesting point you made about Brussels; it reminds me of my experience in Tokyo...""

5. **Issue Description:** Unrealistic portrayal of diverse professional backgrounds without distinct perspectives.
   **Reasoning:** Despite coming from different fields (diplomacy, history, political science), all characters discuss their experiences in a very similar manner without showcasing their unique professional insights effectively.
   **Suggested Improvement:** Highlight distinct perspectives based on their professions. For instance: ""As a historian, I find it fascinating how past events shape current diplomatic strategies"" versus ""From a political scientist's viewpoint, analyzing power dynamics is crucial.""

6. **Issue Description:** Forced inclusion of specific locations for negotiations.
   **Reasoning:** The mention of various cities (Nairobi, Brussels) feels forced and does not contribute significantly to the conversation's flow or content.

By addressing these issues through varied descriptions natural language use interactive dialogue elements distinct professional insights meaningful context for locations mentioned scene will become more realistic engaging readers familiar English-speaking meeting norms
