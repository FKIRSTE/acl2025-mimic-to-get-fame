Water Scarcity,"

Water scarcity (closely related to water stress or water crisis) is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand. There are two types of water scarcity. One is physical. The other is economic water scarcity.[2]: 560  Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands. This includes water needed for ecosystems to function. Regions with a desert climate often face physical water scarcity.[3] Central Asia, West Asia, and North Africa are examples of arid areas. Economic water scarcity results from a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers, or other water sources. It also results from weak human capacity to meet water demand.[2]: 560  Many people in Sub-Saharan Africa are living with economic water scarcity.[4]: 11 

There is enough freshwater available globally and averaged over the year to meet demand. As such, water scarcity is caused by a mismatch between when and where people need water, and when and where it is available.[5] This can happen due to an increase in the number of people in a region, changing living conditions and diets, and expansion of irrigated agriculture.[6][7][8] Climate change (including droughts or floods), deforestation, water pollution and wasteful use of water can also mean there is not enough water.[9] These variations in scarcity may also be a function of prevailing economic policy and planning approaches. 

Water scarcity assessments look at many types of information. They include green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, and virtual water trade.[8] Water stress is one parameter to measure water scarcity. It is useful in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6.[10] Half a billion people live in areas with severe water scarcity throughout the year,[5][8] and around four billion people face severe water scarcity at least one month per year.[5][11] Half of the world's largest cities experience water scarcity.[11] There are 2.3 billion people who reside in nations with water scarcities (meaning less than 1700 m3 of water per person per year).[12][13][14]

There are different ways to reduce water scarcity. It can be done through supply and demand side management, cooperation between countries and water conservation. Expanding sources of usable water can help. Reusing wastewater and desalination are ways to do this. Others are reducing water pollution and changes to the virtual water trade.

Water scarcity has been defined as the ""volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources"" and it is thought to be ""human-driven"".[15]: 4  This can also be called ""physical water scarcity"".[4] There are two types of water scarcity. One is physical water scarcity and the other is economic  water scarcity.[2]: 560  Some definitions of water scarcity look at environmental water requirements. This approach varies from one organization to another.[15]: 4  
Related concepts are water stress and water risk. The CEO Water Mandate, an initiative of the UN Global Compact, proposed to harmonize these in 2014.[15]: 2  In their discussion paper they state that these three terms should not be used interchangeably.[15]: 3 
Some organizations define water stress as a broader concept. It would include aspects of water availability, water quality and accessibility. Accessibility depends on existing infrastructure. It also depends on whether customers can afford to pay for the water.[15]: 4  Some experts call this economic water scarcity.[4]

The FAO defines water stress as the ""symptoms of water scarcity or shortage"". Such symptoms could be ""growing conflict between users, and competition for water, declining standards of reliability and service, harvest failures and food insecurity"".[17]: 6  This is measured with a range of Water Stress Indices.

A group of scientists provided another definition for water stress in 2016: ""Water stress refers to the impact of high water use (either withdrawals or consumption) relative to water availability.""[1] This means water stress would be a demand-driven scarcity.

Experts have defined two types of water scarcity. One is physical water scarcity. The other is economic water scarcity. These terms were first defined in a 2007 study led by the International Water Management Institute. This examined the use of water in agriculture over the previous 50 years. It aimed to find out if the world had sufficient water resources to produce food for the growing population in the future.[4][17]: 1 

Physical water scarcity occurs when natural water resources are not enough to meet all demands. This includes water needed for ecosystems to function well. Dry regions often suffer from physical water scarcity. Human influence on climate has intensified water scarcity in areas where it was already a problem.[18] It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed. One example is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure. This can be for irrigation or energy generation. There are several symptoms of physical water scarcity. They include severe environmental degradation, declining groundwater and water allocations favouring some groups over others.[17]: 6 

Experts have proposed another indicator. This is called ecological water scarcity. It considers water quantity, water quality, and environmental flow requirements.[19]

Water is scarce in densely populated arid areas. These are projected to have less than 1000 cubic meters available per capita per year.  Examples are Central and West Asia, and North Africa).[3] A study in 2007 found that more than 1.2 billion people live in areas of physical water scarcity.[20] This water scarcity relates to water available for food production, rather than for drinking water which is a much smaller amount.[3][21]

Some academics favour adding a third type which would be called ecological water scarcity.[19] It would focus on the water demand of ecosystems. It would refer to the minimum quantity and quality of water discharge needed to maintain sustainable and functional ecosystems. Some publications argue that this is simply part of the definition of physical water scarcity.[17][4]

Economic water scarcity is due to a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers, or other water sources. It also reflects insufficient human capacity to meet the demand for water.[22]: 560  It causes people without reliable water access to travel long distances to fetch water for household and agricultural uses. Such water is often unclean.

The United Nations Development Programme says economic water scarcity is the most common cause of water scarcity. This is because most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs. But they lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.[23] Around a fifth of the world's population currently live in regions affected by physical water scarcity.[23]

A quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. It is a feature of much of Sub-Saharan Africa.[4]: 11  So better water infrastructure there could help to reduce poverty. Investing in water retention and irrigation infrastructure would help increase food production. This is especially the case for developing countries that rely on low-yield agriculture.[24] Providing water that is adequate for consumption would also benefit public health.[25] This is not only a question of new infrastructure. Economic and political intervention are necessary to tackle poverty and social inequality. The lack of funding means there is a need for planning.[26]

The emphasis is usually on improving water sources for drinking and domestic purposes. But more water is used for purposes such as bathing, laundry, livestock and cleaning than drinking and cooking.[25] This suggests that too much emphasis on drinking water addresses only part of the problem. So it can limit the range of solutions available.[25]

There are several indicators for measuring water scarcity. One is the water use to availability ratio. This is also known as the criticality ratio. Another is the IWMI Indicator. This measures physical and economic water scarcity. Another is the water poverty index.[8]

""Water stress"" is a criterion to measure water scarcity.  Experts use it in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6.[10] A report by the FAO in 2018 provided a definition of water stress. It described it as  ""the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn (TFWW) by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR), after taking into account environmental flow requirements (EFR)"". This means that the value for TFWW is divided by the difference between TRWR minus EFR.[28]: xii  Environmental flows are water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. A previous definition in Millennium Development Goal 7, target 7.A, was simply the proportion of total water resources used, without taking EFR into consideration.[28]: 28  This definition sets out several categories for water stress. Below 10% is low stress; 10-20% is low-to-medium; 20-40% medium-to-high; 40-80% high; above 80% very high.[29]

Indicators are used to measure the extent of water scarcity.[30] One way to measure water scarcity is to calculate the amount of water resources available per person each year. One example is the ""Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator"". This was developed by Malin Falkenmark.  This indicator says a country or region experiences ""water stress"" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic meters per person per year.[31] Levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters will lead to periodic or limited water shortages. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year the country faces ""water scarcity"". However, the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity.[3]

It is also possible to measure water scarcity by looking at renewable freshwater. Experts use it when evaluating water scarcity. This metric can describe the total available water resources each country contains. This total available water resource gives an idea of whether a country tend to experience physical water scarcity.[32] This metric has a drawback because it is an average. Precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year. So annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric does not describe how easy it is for individuals, households, industries or government to access water. Lastly this metric gives a description of a whole country. So it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. For example, Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply. But they still face various water-related problems.[32] Some tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low levels of freshwater resources.

Water scarcity assessments must include several types of information. They include data on green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalisation, and virtual water trade.[8] Since the early 2000s, water scarcity assessments have used more complex models. These benefit from spatial analysis tools. Green-blue water scarcity is one of these. Footprint-based water scarcity assessment is another. Another is cumulative abstraction to demand ratio, which considers temporal variations. Further examples are LCA-based water stress indicators and integrated water quantity–quality environment flow.[8] Since the early 2010s assessments have looked at water scarcity from both quantity and quality perspectives.[33]

Experts have proposed a further indicator. This is called ecological water scarcity. It considers water quantity, water quality, and environmental flow requirements.[19] Results from a modelling study in 2022 show that northern China suffered more severe ecological water scarcity than southern China. The driving factor of ecological water scarcity in most provinces was water pollution rather than human water use.[19]

A successful assessment will bring together experts from several scientific discipline. These include the hydrological, water quality, aquatic ecosystem science, and social science communities.[8]

The United Nations estimates that only 200,000 cubic kilometers of the total 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on Earth is freshwater available for human consumption. A mere 0.014% of all water on Earth is both fresh and easily accessible.[34] Of the remaining water, 97% is saline, and a little less than 3% is difficult to access. The fresh water available to us on the planet is around 1% of the total water on earth.[35]  The total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth is 14,000 cubic kilometers. This takes the form of surface water such as rivers and lakes or groundwater, for example in aquifers. Of this total amount, humanity uses and resuses just 5,000 cubic kilometers. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. So  in theory there is more than enough freshwater available to meet the demands of the current world population of 8 billion people. There is even enough to support population growth to 9 billion or more. But unequal geographical distribution and  unequal consumption of water makes it a scarce resource in some regions and groups of people.

Rivers and lakes provide common surface sources of freshwater. But other water resources such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater. They have become the main source of clean water. Groundwater is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth. It can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas of groundwater are also known as aquifers. It is becoming harder to use conventional sources because of pollution and climate change. So people are drawing more and more on these other sources. Population growth is encouraging greater use of these types of water resources.[32]

In 2019 the World Economic Forum listed water scarcity as one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade.[36] Water scarcity can take several forms. One is a failure to meet demand for water, partially or totally. Other examples are economic competition for water quantity or quality, disputes between users, irreversible depletion of groundwater, and negative impacts on the environment.

About half of the world's population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year.[37] Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round.[5] Half of the world's largest cities experience water scarcity.[11] Almost two billion people do not currently have access to clean drinking water.

[38][39] A study in 2016 calculated that the number of people suffering from water scarcity increased from 0.24 billion or 14% of global population in the 1900s to 3.8 billion (58%) in the 2000s.[1] This study used two concepts to analyse water scarcity. One is shortage, or impacts due to low availability per capita. The other is stress, or impacts due to high consumption relative to availability.

In the 20th century, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase. Specifically, water withdrawals are likely to rise by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries, and 18 per cent in developed countries.[40] One continent, for example, Africa, has been predicted to have 75 to 250 million inhabitants lacking access to fresh water.[41] By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions.[42] By 2050, more than half of the world's population will live in water-stressed areas, and another billion may lack sufficient water, MIT researchers find.[43]

With the increase in global temperatures and an increase in water demand, six out of ten people are at risk of being water-stressed. The drying out of wetlands globally, at around 67%, was a direct cause of a large number of people at risk of water stress. As global demand for water increases and temperatures rise, it is likely that two thirds of the population will live under water stress in 2025.[44][35]: 191 

According to a projection by the United Nations, by 2040, there can be about 4.5 billion people affected by a water crisis (or water scarcity). Additionally, with the increase in population, there will be a demand for food, and for the food output to match the population growth, there would be an increased demand for water to irrigate crops.[45] The World Economic Forum estimates that global water demand will surpass global supply by 40% by 2030.[46][47] Increasing the water demand as well as increasing the population results in a water crisis where there is not enough water to share in healthy levels. The crises are not only due to quantity but quality also matters.

A study found that 6-20% of about 39 million groundwater wells are at high risk of running dry if local groundwater levels decline by a few meters. In many areas and with possibly more than half of major aquifers[48] this would apply if they simply continue to decline.[49][50]

Controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply can contribute to scarcity. A 2006 United Nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis. The report noted that: ""There is enough water for everyone"". It also said: ""Water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure"".[52]

Economists and others have argued that a lack of property rights, government regulations and water subsidies have given rise to the situation with water. These factors cause prices to be too low and consumption too high, making a point for water privatization.[53][54][55]

The clean water crisis is an emerging global crisis affecting approximately 785 million people around the world.[56] 1.1 billion people lack access to water and 2.7 billion experience water scarcity at least one month in a year. 2.4 billion people suffer from  contaminated water and poor sanitation. Contamination of water can lead to deadly diarrheal diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases. These account for 80% of illnesses around the world.[57]


Using water for domestic, food and industrial uses has major impacts on ecosystems in many parts of the world. This can apply even to regions not considered ""water scarce"".[3] Water scarcity damages the environment in many ways. These include adverse effects on lakes, rivers, ponds, wetlands and other fresh water resources. Thus results in water overuse because water is scarce. This often occurs in areas of irrigation agriculture. It can harm the environment in several ways. This includes increased salinity, nutrient pollution, and the loss of floodplains and wetlands.[23][58] Water scarcity also makes it harder to use flow to rehabilitate urban streams.[59]
Through the last hundred years, more than half of the Earth's wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared.[9] These wetlands are important as the habitats of numerous creatures such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. They also support the growing of rice and other food crops. And they provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia have also suffered. It was once the fourth largest freshwater lake in the world. But it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.[9]

Subsidence is another result of water scarcity. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage.[60]

Vegetation and wildlife need sufficient freshwater. Marshes, bogs and riparian zones are more clearly dependent upon sustainable water supply. Forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk as water becomes less available. In the case of wetlands, a lot of ground has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. Other areas have also suffered from a gradual fall in freshwater inflow as upstream water is diverted for human use.

Other impacts include growing conflict between users and growing competition for water.[17]: 6  Examples for the potential for conflict from water scarcity include: Food insecurity in the Middle East and North Africa Region[61] and regional conflicts over scarce water resources.[62]

Around fifty years ago, the common view was that water was an infinite resource. At that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now seven billion people on the planet and their consumption of water-thirsty meat is rising. And industry, urbanization, biofuel crops, and water reliant food items are competing more and more for water. In the future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.[63]

In 2000, the world population was 6.2 billion. The UN estimates that by 2050 there will be an additional 3.5 billion people, with most of the growth in developing countries that already suffer water stress.[64] This will increase demand for water unless there are corresponding increases in water conservation and recycling.[65] In building on the data presented here by the UN, the World Bank[66] goes on to explain that access to water for producing food will be one of the main challenges in the decades to come. It will be necessary to balance access to water with managing water in a sustainable way. At the same time it will be necessary to take the impact of climate change and other environmental and social variables into account.[67]

In 60% of European cities with more than 100,000 people, groundwater is being used at a faster rate than it can be replenished.[68]

The increase in the number of people is increasing competition for water. This is depleting many of the world's major aquifers. It has two causes. One is direct human consumption. The other is agricultural irrigation. Millions of pumps of all sizes are currently extracting groundwater throughout the world. Irrigation in dry areas such as northern China, Nepal and India draws on groundwater. And it is  extracting groundwater at an unsustainable rate. Many cities  have experienced aquifer drops of between 10 and 50 meters. They include Mexico City, Bangkok, Beijing, Chennai and Shanghai.[70]

Until recently, groundwater was not a highly used resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed.[71] Improved knowledge, technology and funding have made it possible to focus more on drawing water from groundwater resources instead of surface water. These made the agricultural groundwater revolution possible. They expanded the irrigation sector which made it possible to increase food production and development in rural areas.[72] Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world.[73] The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable buffer capacity. This makes it possible to withdraw water during periods of drought or little rainfall.[32] This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on precipitation or surface water for their only supplies. It provides reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at 1,000 km3 per year. Of this 67% goes on irrigation, 22% on domestic purposes and 11% on industrial purposes.[32] The top ten major consumers of abstracted water make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide. They are India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy.[32]

Goundwater sources are quite plentiful. But one major area of concern is the renewal or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. Extracting from non-rewable groundwater sources could exhaust them if they are not properly monitored and managed.[74]  Increasing use of groundwater can also reduce water quality over time. Groundwater systems often show falls in natural outflows, stored volumes, and water levels as well as water degradation.[32] Groundwater depletion can cause harm in many ways. These include more costly groundwater pumping and changes in salinity and other types of water quality. They can also lead to land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows.

The main cause of water scarcity as a result of consumption is the extensive use of water in agriculture/livestock breeding and industry. People in developed countries generally use about 10 times more water a day than people in developing countries.[77] A large part of this is indirect use in water-intensive agricultural and industrial production of consumer goods. Examples are fruit, oilseed crops and cotton. Many of these production chains are globalized, So a lot of water consumption and pollution in developing countries occurs to produce goods  for consumption in developed countries.[78]

Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. This does not use up the total fresh water supply. But it means that much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food. At the same time industry and cities find will have to find ways to use water more efficiently.[79]

Business activities such as tourism are continuing to expand. They create a need for increases in water  supply and sanitation. This in turn can lead to more pressure on water resources and natural ecosystems.  The approximate 50% growth in world energy use by 2040 will also increase the need for efficient water use.[79] It may means some water use shifts from irrigation to industry. This is because thermal power generation uses water for steam generation and cooling.[80]


Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with  a negative impact on their uses.[81]: 6  It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.[82] Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation.[83] Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.

Climate change could have a big impact on water resources around the world because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation. However there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent and more severe in different regions at different times. There will be generally less snowfall and more rainfall in a warmer climate.[86] Changes in snowfall and snow melt in mountainous areas will also take place. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality in ways that scientists do not fully understand. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also boost demand for irrigation systems in agriculture. There is now ample evidence that greater hydrologic variability and climate change have had a profound impact on the water sector, and will continue to do so. This will show up in the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.[87]

The United Nations' FAO states that by 2025 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity. It says  two thirds of the world's population could be under stress conditions.[88] The World Bank says that climate change could profoundly alter future patterns of water availability and use. This will make water stress and insecurity worse, at the global level and in sectors that depend on water.[89]

Scientists have found that population change is four time more important than long-term climate change in its effects on water scarcity.[44]

The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.[90] Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.

A review in 2006 stated that ""It is surprisingly difficult to determine whether water is truly scarce in the physical sense at a global scale (a supply problem) or whether it is available but should be used better (a demand problem)"".[95]

The International Resource Panel of the UN states that governments have invested heavily in inefficient solutions. These are mega-projects like dams, canals, aqueducts, pipelines and water reservoirs. They are generally neither environmentally sustainable nor economically viable.[96] According to the panel, the most cost-effective way of decoupling water use from economic growth is for governments to create holistic water management plans. These would take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, treatment, recycling, reuse and return to the environment.

In general, there is enough water on an annual and global scale. The issue is more of variation of supply by time and by region. Reservoirs and pipelines would deal with this variable water supply. Well-planned infrastructure with demand side management is necessary. Both supply-side and demand-side management have advantages and disadvantages.[citation needed]

Lack of cooperation may give rise to regional water conflicts. This is especially the case in developing countries. The main reason is  disputes regarding the availability, use and management of water.[62] One example is the dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam which escalated in 2020.[97][98] Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat, fearing that the dam will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile.[99]

Water conservation aims to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, protect the hydrosphere, and meet current and future human demand. Water conservation makes it possible to avoid water scarcity. It covers all the policies, strategies and activities to reach these aims. Population, household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. 

Wastewater treatment is a process which removes and eliminates contaminants from wastewater. It thus converts it into an effluent that can be returned to the water cycle. Once back in the water cycle, the effluent creates an acceptable impact on the environment. It is also possible to reuse it. This process is called water reclamation.[111] The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant. There are several kinds of wastewater which are treated at the appropriate type of wastewater treatment plant. For domestic wastewater the treatment plant is called a Sewage Treatment. Municipal wastewater or sewage are other names for domestic wastewater. For industrial wastewater, treatment takes place in a separate Industrial wastewater treatment, or in a sewage treatment plant. In the latter case it usually follows pre-treatment. Further types of wastewater treatment plants include Agricultural wastewater treatment and leachate treatment plants.

The virtual water trade is the hidden flow of water in food or other commodities that are traded from one place to another.[117] Other terms for it are embedded or embodied water. The virtual water trade is the idea that virtual water is exchanged along with goods and services. This idea provides a new, amplified perspective on water problems. It balances different perspectives, basic conditions, and interests. This concept makes it possible to distinguish between global, regional, and local levels and their linkages. However, the use of virtual water estimates may offer no guidance for policymakers seeking to ensure they are meeting environmental objectives.

The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) published a map showing the countries and regions suffering most water stress.[120] They are North Africa, the Middle East,[121] India, Central Asia, China, Chile, Colombia, South Africa, Canada and Australia. Water scarcity is also increasing in South Asia.[122] As of 2016, about four billion people, or two thirds of the world's population, were facing severe water scarcity.[123]

The more developed countries of North America, Europe and Russia will not see a serious threat to water supply by 2025 in general. This is not only because of their relative wealth. Their populations will also be more in line with available water resources.[citation needed]  North Africa, the Middle East, South Africa and northern China will face very severe water shortages. This is due to physical scarcity and too many people for the water that is available.[citation needed]  Most of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, southern China and India will face water supply shortages by 2025. For these regions, scarcity will be due to economic constraints on developing safe drinking water, and excessive population growth.[citation needed]

The main causes of water scarcity in Africa are physical and economic water scarcity, rapid population growth, and the effects of climate change on the water cycle. Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand.[125] The rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa is highly seasonal and unevenly distributed, leading to frequent floods and droughts.[126]

Water scarcity in Yemen (see: Water supply and sanitation in Yemen) is a growing problem. Population growth and climate change are among the causes. Others are poor water management, shifts in rainfall, water infrastructure deterioration, poor governance, and other anthropogenic effects. As of 2011, water scarcity is having political, economic and social impacts in Yemen. As of 2015,[128] Yemen is one of the countries suffering most from water scarcity. Most people in Yemen experience water scarcity for at least one month a year.

In Nigeria, some reports have suggested that increase in extreme heat, drought and the shrinking of Lake Chad is causing water shortage and environmental migration. This is forcing thousands to migrate to neighboring Chad and towns.[129]

A major report in 2019 by more than 200 researchers, found that the Himalayan glaciers could lose 66 percent of their ice by 2100.[130] These glaciers are the sources of Asia's biggest rivers – Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Yellow.  Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers.[131] India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades. In India alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people.[132][133][134]

Even with the overpumping of its aquifers, China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.[135][136]

It is highly likely that climate change in Turkey will cause its southern river basins to be water scarce before 2070, and increasing drought in Turkey.[137]

In the Rio Grande Valley, intensive agribusiness has made water scarcity worse. It has sparked jurisdictional disputes regarding water rights on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Scholars such as Mexico's Armand Peschard-Sverdrup have argued that this tension has created the need for new strategic transnational water management.[139] Some have likened the disputes to a war over diminishing natural resources.[140][141]

The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, is also vulnerable.[142][143]

By far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback.[144] Water restrictions are in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from drought. Environmentalist Tim Flannery predicted that Perth in Western Australia could become the world's first ghost metropolis. This would mean it was an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population, said Flannery, who was Australian of the year 2007.[145] In 2010, Perth suffered its second-driest winter on record[146] and the water corporation tightened water restrictions for spring.[147]

Some countries have already proven that decoupling water use from economic growth is possible. For example, in Australia, water consumption declined by 40% between 2001 and 2009 while the economy grew by more than 30%.[96]

Water scarcity or water crisis in particular countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims for clean water and sanitation for all.[148] It is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The fourth target of SDG 6 refers to water scarcity. It states: ""By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity"".[10]

standard demand. Two types of water scarcity were identified: physical and economic. Physical scarcity occurs when natural water resources are insufficient, often affecting arid regions like Central Asia and North Africa. Economic scarcity results from inadequate infrastructure or technology to access water, commonly seen in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite sufficient global freshwater availability, regional mismatches in supply and demand cause scarcity. Factors such as population growth, climate change, deforestation, pollution, and wasteful use exacerbate the problem. Water stress is a key measure of scarcity and impacts half a billion people year-round and four billion at least one month annually. Solutions discussed include supply and demand management, international cooperation, conservation efforts, wastewater reuse, desalination, reducing pollution, and changes in virtual water trade. The importance of sustainable development goals was emphasized to address these issues effectively.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the stage for the meeting\n- Brief greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Quick recap of previous discussions (if any)\n- Introduction to today's main topic: Water Scarcity"", ""Scene 2: Defining Water Scarcity\nTLDR: Discussing the types and causes of water scarcity\n- Hydrologist explains physical water scarcity with examples from Central Asia and North Africa\n- Environmental Economist discusses economic water scarcity in Sub-Saharan Africa\n- Climate Scientist highlights factors exacerbating water scarcity like climate change, deforestation, pollution"", ""Scene 3: Impact Analysis\nTLDR: Exploring the impacts of water scarcity on different sectors\n- Sociologist shares social impacts on communities, using anecdotes or case studies\n- Public Health Expert discusses health impacts, focusing on disease prevention and health promotion\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions and personal experiences related to impacts"", ""Scene 4: Solutions and Strategies\nTLDR: Identifying potential solutions to address water scarcity\n- Water Policy Expert outlines policy recommendations for effective water management and conservation efforts\n- Discussion on supply management strategies like desalination, wastewater reuse, reducing pollution (led by Hydrologist)\n- Demand management strategies including changes in virtual water trade (led by Environmental Economist)"", ""Scene 5: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nTLDR: Emphasizing the importance of SDG 6 in addressing water scarcity issues\n- Climate Scientist explains how sustainable development goals can mitigate climate-related impacts on water resources\n- Sociologist discusses community-level initiatives that align with SDG 6 goals"", ""Scene 6: Coordination and Collaboration Efforts\nTLDR: Planning collaborative efforts to tackle water scarcity effectively \n - Brainstorming session for international cooperation opportunities \n - Sharing best practices from different regions \n - Open discussion for spontaneous ideas or unplanned topics related to collaboration"", ""Scene 7: Recap and Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarizing key points discussed and planning future actions \n - Quick recap of main discussion points \n - Assigning tasks or follow-up actions if necessary \n - Setting date/time for next meeting if needed \n - Closing remarks from each participant""]",">>Water Policy Expert: Good morning, everyone. Let's get started on our discussion about water scarcity.

>>Hydrologist: Morning! Ready to dive into water scarcity solutions.

>>Environmental Economist: Hi all! Excited to discuss our strategies for tackling this issue.

>>Climate Scientist: Hey everyone. We've previously talked about climate change impacts on water availability and sustainable practices.

>>Sociologist: Morning! It's crucial that we look at how communities are affected by water scarcity and what measures can help them cope.

>>Public Health Expert: Morning, everyone. Water scarcity has significant health implications that we need to consider in our discussions today.

>>Water Policy Expert: Absolutely. To start off, let's quickly recap our previous discussions. We've examined the impacts of climate change on water availability and emphasized the importance of sustainable management practices.

>>Hydrologist: Right, um, we've also looked at how changing precipitation patterns affect groundwater recharge rates and surface water flows.

>>Environmental Economist: That's true, and from an economic perspective, addressing water scarcity requires balancing immediate costs with long-term benefits. Investments in infrastructure like wastewater treatment and desalination plants can be expensive upfront but offer sustainable solutions over time.

>>Climate Scientist: Exactly. We need to consider both short-term fixes and long-term strategies to ensure a reliable water supply in the face of climate variability.

>>Sociologist: You know, it's also important to think about how these solutions impact different communities differently. Some might benefit more than others based on their existing resources and vulnerabilities.

>>Public Health Expert: Definitely. The health impacts can't be overlooked either—waterborne diseases become more prevalent when clean water is scarce, as we saw in last year's report from WHO.

>>Water Policy Expert: Well said. Let's make sure we're considering all these aspects as we move forward with our discussion today. 
 >>Hydrologist: According to our data, physical water scarcity is particularly severe in regions like Central Asia and North Africa. These areas experience significant environmental degradation and declining groundwater levels due to overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation and energy generation. This overuse leads to severe environmental impacts.

>>Environmental Economist: Well, economically speaking, Sub-Saharan Africa's main issue is a lack of investment in infrastructure and technology. This region has enough water resources, but the inability to access and distribute this water effectively leads to significant challenges. Improving infrastructure investments could drastically reduce poverty and enhance food security.

>>Climate Scientist: Uh, our research indicates that climate change is a pressing issue exacerbating water scarcity. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and severe droughts, particularly in already arid regions like Central Asia and North Africa. Additionally, deforestation and pollution further strain these limited water resources.

>>Water Policy Expert: I agree with what the Hydrologist said about overdevelopment. Effective water management is crucial here. We need policies that balance development with conservation efforts while integrating both physical and economic aspects of water scarcity.

>>Sociologist: You know, from a sociological standpoint, the social impacts of water scarcity are significant. Communities facing water scarcity often experience heightened social tensions and inequalities. For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic constraints can lead to conflicts over access to clean water, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.

>>Public Health Expert: Um, health-wise, the impacts of water scarcity are dire. We see an increase in diseases like cholera and typhoid fever, especially in regions with economic constraints on accessing clean water. Ensuring quality access should be our priority now if we want to prevent these health crises from escalating further.

>>Hydrologist: In addition to what I mentioned earlier about physical scarcity in Central Asia and North Africa due to overdevelopment, we also need to consider the impact of urbanization on these regions' water resources.

>>Environmental Economist: Furthermore, addressing economic issues isn't just about building infrastructure; it's also about ensuring that investments are sustainable and equitable. Public-private partnerships could fund these projects more effectively while empowering local communities through community-based management systems.

>>Climate Scientist: Our data also shows that climate change impacts are more severe in regions with poor adaptive capacity. Rising temperatures not only increase evaporation rates but also alter precipitation patterns leading to more frequent droughts.

>>Water Policy Expert: From a regulatory perspective, we need integrated strategies addressing both physical and economic aspects of scarce resources involving equitable access promotion alongside sustainable practices investment.

>>Sociologist: Building on what the Environmental Economist mentioned about community-based management reducing social tensions—when there's not enough investment in infrastructure for clean water access—it often leads to conflicts over this vital resource especially affecting vulnerable groups.

>>Public Health Expert: Um well from my view health impacts here are dire increased cases cholera typhoid fever especially where there's economic constraints ensuring quality access should be priority now 
 >>Sociologist: I've noticed that water scarcity often leads to increased social tensions and inequalities. For example, in some rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, women and children spend hours each day fetching water, which limits their opportunities for education and economic activities. How can we address these issues in our own communities?

>>Hydrologist: That's a great point about social tensions. Additionally, our data shows that water scarcity not only affects the availability of drinking water but also has significant impacts on agricultural productivity. This can lead to food insecurity and increased competition for water resources among different sectors. What strategies can we implement to tackle these challenges?

>>Environmental Economist: Building on that, reduced water availability can disrupt local economies significantly. In regions dependent on agriculture, lower crop yields lead to higher food prices, affecting both farmers' incomes and the cost of living for everyone. We need to consider economic policies that support sustainable practices.

>>Climate Scientist: I agree with you all. Our research indicates that water scarcity exacerbates the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems. We should look into integrated water management strategies that consider all sectors—agricultural, industrial, and domestic—to mitigate these effects.

>>Public Health Expert: Improving water infrastructure is crucial here because limited access to clean water often leads to outbreaks of diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. By enhancing sanitation facilities, we can prevent these health crises.

>>Hydrologist: Absolutely. Over-extraction of groundwater can result in land subsidence and reduced water quality, further exacerbating environmental degradation. We need to balance the demand for water with sustainable extraction practices.

>>Environmental Economist: And companies might need to invest in more expensive water-saving technologies or face higher operational costs due to limited supply. This could affect the overall economic stability of a region if not managed properly.

>>Climate Scientist: To add on practical solutions, we should promote policies encouraging efficient use of existing resources while investing in new technologies for better resource management.

>>Sociologist: So considering all these points—social tensions, economic disruptions, health risks—we need a comprehensive approach that includes community education programs about sustainable practices as well.

>>Public Health Expert: Exactly! Addressing malnutrition through improved agricultural productivity will also strengthen immune systems making populations less susceptible to diseases. 
 >>Water Policy Expert: We need to look at all aspects of managing our water supply, including both how we get it and how we use it. Effective water management is crucial, so let's focus on sustainable practices like reusing wastewater and cutting down on pollution.

>>Hydrologist: Um, according to our data, desalination and wastewater reuse are effective ways to manage supply that can really help with water scarcity. Desalination turns seawater into drinkable water, which is great for dry areas with little freshwater. Wastewater reuse means treating used water so it can be used again for things like farming or industry, reducing the demand on our freshwater supplies.

>>Environmental Economist: From an economic perspective, we should also think about changing how we trade virtual water. By importing goods that require a lot of water from places where it's plentiful, we can ease the pressure on our local supplies. This approach not only helps manage demand but also promotes global cooperation.

>>Climate Scientist: Uh, our research shows that climate change is making water scarcity worse by changing rainfall patterns and causing more extreme weather events. This affects both the availability and quality of freshwater, leading to more severe droughts and floods. We need to address this now by including ways to handle climate change in our plans.

>>Sociologist: You know, from a sociological standpoint, it's crucial to consider how these strategies will impact different communities. For instance, desalination plants might provide water but could also lead to increased costs for local residents. What does this mean for our communities?

>>Hydrologist: As you can see from the graph—

>>Public Health Expert (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—can you clarify what kind of energy inputs we're talking about for desalination plants? Are there any renewable options being considered?

>>Hydrologist: Good question! Desalination does use a lot of energy, but we can reduce emissions if we use renewable sources like solar or wind.

>>(A notification sound interrupts)

>>Environmental Economist: In terms of sustainability—uh—we should also look at the economic benefits of virtual water trade. By importing water-intensive goods from regions with abundant resources, we can alleviate local water stress and promote global cooperation.

>>(A notification sound interrupts)

>>Climate Scientist: Sorry about that notification sound—let's continue. So...our research indicates that climate change is exacerbating water scarcity by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. This not only affects the availability of freshwater but also impacts water quality, leading to more severe droughts and floods. We need to address this now by integrating climate resilience into our plans.

>>Sociologist: From a sociological standpoint—um—it’s important to consider the social impacts of these strategies beyond just providing much-needed water. 
 >>Climate Scientist: Our research shows that integrating climate resilience into water management is crucial. We need to act now.

>>Hydrologist: According to our data, regions facing economic water scarcity can benefit significantly from investments in infrastructure and technology, including pipelines, treatment plants, and advanced water management systems. These investments lead to improved water use efficiency and better resource allocation.

>>Environmental Economist: Investing in water infrastructure helps with immediate scarcity and promotes long-term stability. Sustainable development is key to ensuring that communities can thrive without depleting their resources. Does that make sense?

>>Sociologist: From a sociological standpoint, community-level initiatives are vital. Empowering local communities through education and resource management training can significantly improve water use efficiency. Additionally, fostering community-led projects can enhance local engagement and ensure sustainable practices.

>>Public Health Expert: If I may add something here, it's important to mention the public health implications too. Improved water infrastructure directly impacts health outcomes by reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases.

>>Environmental Economist: Absolutely! That's a great point about health outcomes. Investing in these infrastructures has multiple benefits beyond just the economy.

>>Climate Scientist: Addressing water scarcity through Sustainable Development Goal 6 is essential. Integrating climate resilience into water management can significantly mitigate the impacts of climate change on our resources. For example, using advanced irrigation systems and promoting rainwater harvesting can enhance efficiency and sustainability. 
 >>Water Policy Expert: In terms of policy, we need to establish frameworks that facilitate international cooperation. Effective water management is crucial, and sharing best practices can help us all. For instance, partnerships between countries could facilitate the sharing of technology and resources to build efficient irrigation systems—does that make sense?

>>Hydrologist: Yeah, definitely. According to our data, understanding water cycle dynamics is key to managing water resources effectively. Take Sub-Saharan Africa, for example—they face economic water scarcity due to inadequate infrastructure investment. We should look at how international cooperation can address these disparities by sharing technology and resources.

>>Environmental Economist: Absolutely! From an economic perspective, sustainable development is essential. Look at the Mekong River Commission—countries there share data and resources to manage water effectively. This model could be replicated in other regions facing similar challenges.

>>Climate Scientist: I agree with you both, but we also need to consider how climate change exacerbates water scarcity by altering precipitation patterns and increasing extreme weather events. This impacts not just water availability but also agricultural productivity and food security. Integrating climate resilience into our efforts is crucial.

>>Sociologist: That's a good point. And from a sociological standpoint, it's important to consider how water scarcity affects different communities differently. Women and children in rural areas often bear the brunt of collecting water, which impacts their education and health. How do we ensure our collaborative efforts address these social dimensions?

>>Public Health Expert: Right! And from a public health perspective, limited access to clean water increases the risk of diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. We need international cooperation that includes robust health infrastructure improvements.

>>Water Policy Expert: Absolutely! We should also think about creating policies that encourage community-level initiatives for better resource management.

>>Hydrologist: Speaking of community initiatives, have you seen the recent project in Kenya? They've implemented advanced irrigation technologies with great success by investing in local infrastructure.

>>Environmental Economist: Yes! That project has shown promising results economically too—improved infrastructure leads to long-term stability through sustainable development.

>>Climate Scientist: While I agree on the importance of advanced irrigation systems, we also need to consider their environmental impact. For instance, over-extraction can lead to groundwater depletion.

>>Sociologist: True, but empowering local communities through education and training for better resource management is essential for long-term success as well.

>>Public Health Expert: Exactly! Without immediate improvements in water access, we're risking public health crises in many regions. 
 >>Water Policy Expert: Alright, let's recap and plan our next steps. We need clear guidelines for infrastructure investments and community education programs. I'll assign specific tasks to each of us to streamline the implementation process.

>>Hydrologist: Um, based on our data, integrating climate resilience into water management strategies is crucial. This includes advanced irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting to enhance efficiency and sustainability. Let's make sure these measures are part of our next steps.

>>Environmental Economist: Well, from an economic perspective, it's vital that we allocate resources efficiently to ensure the sustainability of our water management strategies. We should consider the long-term impact of these investments on both physical and economic water scarcity. What do you all think about that?

>>Sociologist: You know, from a sociological standpoint, it's essential to consider how these policies will impact different communities, especially the most vulnerable. Let's ensure our plans are inclusive and address social inequalities. How can we make sure we're covering all communities?

>>Public Health Expert: Um, from a public health perspective, addressing the health impacts of water scarcity is critical. We need to prioritize improving water infrastructure to prevent disease outbreaks and ensure access to clean water for all communities. Let's focus on prevention strategies and allocate resources effectively.

>>Climate Scientist: Building on what the Hydrologist mentioned earlier about climate resilience—our research shows that advanced irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting can significantly enhance efficiency and sustainability. I have some additional data that could help us prioritize these measures urgently.

>>Water Policy Expert: Great points everyone! So here's what we'll do: I'll draft the policy guidelines for infrastructure investments; Hydrologist, are you okay with identifying key areas for implementing advanced irrigation systems?

>>Hydrologist: Yes, absolutely! I'll start gathering data on potential sites right away.

>>Water Policy Expert: Perfect! Environmental Economist, can you analyze resource allocation models?

>>Environmental Economist: Sure thing! I’ll look into efficient resource allocation models that can sustain long-term benefits.

>>Water Policy Expert: Sociologist, would you be able to assess community impacts?

>>Sociologist: Definitely! I’ll engage with community leaders to understand their needs better and ensure inclusivity in our plans.

>>Water Policy Expert: Public Health Expert, can you focus on health infrastructure improvements?

>>Public Health Expert: Of course! I’ll develop a framework for improving health infrastructure focused on preventing disease outbreaks due to water scarcity.

>>Water Policy Expert: And Climate Scientist, could you provide data support for climate resilience measures?

>>Climate Scientist: Absolutely! I’ll compile relevant data on climate resilience measures that we can integrate into our strategies immediately.

>>Water Policy Expert: Perfect! Let’s reconvene next week at the same time to review progress and finalize our action plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?

>>Hydrologist: Just one thing—let's keep communication open throughout the week if any issues arise or if anyone needs additional information or support.

>>Environmental Economist: Agreed!

>>Sociologist: Looking forward to seeing everyone's progress.

>>Public Health Expert: Let's stay aligned as we move forward.

>>Climate Scientist: See you all next week then!"
