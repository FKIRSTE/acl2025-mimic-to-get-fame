Physical Anthropology,"Biological anthropology, also known as physical anthropology, is a natural science discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings, their extinct hominin ancestors, and related non-human primates, particularly from an evolutionary perspective.[1] This subfield of anthropology systematically studies human beings from a biological perspective.

As a subfield of anthropology, biological anthropology itself is further divided into several branches. All branches are united in their common orientation and/or application of evolutionary theory to understanding human biology and behavior.

Biological Anthropology looks different today from the way it did even twenty years ago. Even the name is relatively new, having been 'physical anthropology' for over a century, with some practitioners still applying that term.[2] Biological anthropologists look back to the work of Charles Darwin as a major foundation for what they do today. However, if one traces the intellectual genealogy back to physical anthropology's beginnings—before the discovery of much of what we now know as the hominin fossil record—then the focus shifts to human biological variation. Some editors, see below, have rooted the field even deeper than formal science.

Attempts to study and classify human beings as living organisms date back to ancient Greece. The Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428–c. 347 BC) placed humans on the scala naturae, which included all things, from inanimate objects at the bottom to deities at the top.[3] This became the main system through which scholars thought about nature for the next roughly 2,000 years.[3] Plato's student Aristotle (c. 384–322 BC) observed in his History of Animals that human beings are the only animals to walk upright[3] and argued, in line with his teleological view of nature, that humans have buttocks and no tails in order to give them a soft place to sit when they are tired of standing.[3] He explained regional variations in human features as the result of different climates.[3] He also wrote about physiognomy, an idea derived from writings in the Hippocratic Corpus.[3] Scientific physical anthropology began in the 17th to 18th centuries with the study of racial classification (Georgius Hornius, François Bernier, Carl Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach).[4]

The first prominent physical anthropologist, the German physician Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752–1840) of Göttingen, amassed a large collection of human skulls (Decas craniorum, published during 1790–1828), from which he argued for the division of humankind into five major races (termed Caucasian, Mongolian, Aethiopian, Malayan and American).[5] In the 19th century, French physical anthropologists, led by Paul Broca (1824–1880), focused on craniometry[6] while the German tradition, led by Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), emphasized the influence of environment and disease upon the human body.[7]

In the 1830s and 40s, physical anthropology was prominent in the debate about slavery, with the scientific, monogenist works of the British abolitionist James Cowles Prichard (1786–1848) opposing[8] those of the American polygenist Samuel George Morton (1799–1851).[9]

In the late 19th century, German-American anthropologist Franz Boas (1858–1942) strongly impacted biological anthropology by emphasizing the influence of culture and experience on the human form. His research showed that head shape was malleable to environmental and nutritional factors rather than a stable ""racial"" trait.[10] However, scientific racism still persisted in biological anthropology, with prominent figures such as Earnest Hooton and Aleš Hrdlička promoting theories of racial superiority[11] and a European origin of modern humans.[12]

In 1951 Sherwood Washburn, a former student of Hooton, introduced a ""new physical anthropology.""[13] He changed the focus from racial typology to concentrate upon the study of human evolution, moving away from classification towards evolutionary process. Anthropology expanded to include paleoanthropology and primatology.[14] The 20th century also saw the modern synthesis in biology: the reconciling of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel's research on heredity. Advances in the understanding of the molecular structure of DNA and the development of chronological dating methods opened doors to understanding human variation, both past and present, more accurately and in much greater detail.

The discipline is concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of humans, their extinct ancestors, and related non-human primates from an evolutionary perspective. It was noted that biological anthropology has evolved significantly over the past two decades, with a shift from racial classification to studying human evolution and variation influenced by environmental factors. Historical roots were traced back to ancient Greece, where philosophers like Plato and Aristotle contributed foundational ideas about human classification. The field formally began in the 17th century with racial classification studies by figures such as Blumenbach, who categorized humans into five races based on skull collections. In the 19th century, debates around slavery highlighted differing views on human origins between monogenists and polygenists. Franz Boas later emphasized cultural influences on human form, challenging scientific racism prevalent at the time. Sherwood Washburn's introduction of ""new physical anthropology"" marked a pivotal shift towards understanding evolutionary processes rather than racial typology. Advances in DNA research and dating methods have further refined our understanding of human variation. The meeting concluded with an acknowledgment of these developments shaping modern biological anthropology.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants and setting the tone for the meeting\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick acknowledgment of familiarity among participants\n- Outline meeting objectives and expected outcomes"", ""Scene 2: Evolution of Biological Anthropology\nTLDR: Discuss the historical evolution of biological anthropology from racial classification to human evolution studies\n- Anthropologist provides an overview of the discipline's history\n- Historian adds context on racial classification and its impact on scientific racism\n- Primatologist shares insights on comparative analysis with non-human primates"", ""Scene 3: Advances in DNA Research and Dating Methods\nTLDR: Explore recent advancements in genetic research and dating methods that have refined our understanding of human variation\n- Geneticist discusses breakthroughs in DNA research\n- Anthropologist highlights how these advances have influenced evolutionary theory\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions and questions"", ""Scene 4: Interdepartmental Collaboration Opportunities\nTLDR: Identify opportunities for collaboration across departments to enhance research outcomes\n- Discuss potential joint projects between anthropology, history, primatology, and genetics departments\n- Share personal experiences related to successful collaborations"", ""Scene 5: Resolving Cross-Departmental Issues\nTLDR: Address any existing interdepartmental issues and find resolutions collaboratively\n- Open discussion on current challenges faced by each department\n- Brainstorm solutions collectively with input from all participants"", ""Scene 6: Spontaneous Discussion and Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allow space for natural topic evolution, spontaneous contributions, and brief off-topic moments to foster a relaxed atmosphere \n - Encourage sharing of personal anecdotes related to fieldwork or research discoveries \n - Allow room for humor and light-hearted exchanges"", ""Scene 7: Conclusion and Next Steps \n TLDR: Summarize key points discussed, align on next steps, and close the meeting \n - Recap main takeaways from each scene \n - Agree on action items moving forward \n - Thank everyone for their participation""]",">>Anthropologist: Good morning, everyone!
