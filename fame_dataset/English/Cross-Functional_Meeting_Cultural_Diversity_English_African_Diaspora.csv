African Diaspora,"

The African diaspora is the worldwide collection of communities descended from people from Africa.[48] The term most commonly refers to the descendants of the native West and Central Africans who were enslaved and shipped to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade between the 16th and 19th centuries, with their largest populations in the United States, Brazil, Colombia and Haiti.[49][50] The term can also be used to refer to African descendants who immigrated to other parts of the world. Scholars identify ""four circulatory phases"" of this migration out of Africa.[51]

The phrase African diaspora gradually entered common usage at the turn of the 21st century.[52] The term diaspora originates from the Greek διασπορά (diaspora, ""scattering"") which gained popularity in English in reference to the Jewish diaspora before being more broadly applied to other populations.[53] Less commonly, the term has been used in scholarship to refer to more recent emigration from Africa.[54]

The African Union (AU) defines the African diaspora as consisting: ""of people of native or partial African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union"".[55] Its constitutive act declares that it shall ""invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in the building of the African Union"".[56]

The African populations in the Americas are descended from haplogroup L genetic groups of native Africans.[57][58]

Many Africans dispersed throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia during the Atlantic, Trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades.

The earliest recorded evidence of Africans as slaves outside of Africa comes from Ancient Greece and Rome. In the Greco-Roman world, almost all native Africans were known primarily as Aithiopians, a term that refers to the constellation of Cepheus, the King of the Sky in Greek mythology. Cepheus was the Greco mythological king of Ethiopia. The constellation Cepheus, which comes from the Greek word meaning “gardener,” is home to an important variable star, Delta Cephei, after which the Cepheid variables—stars used to estimate distances in the universe—are named. Most Aithiopian slaves in the Greco-Roman world came from Kush (modern-day Sudan), after they became prisoners of war in altercations with nearby Egypt. Archaeological evidence shows that a very small proportion of slaves in the Greco-Roman world were Aithiopian, in part due to the distance required for import. Aithiopian slaves were primarily engaged in domestic and entertainment work, leading archaeologists to believe that they were considered an expensive luxury. In one ostentatious display, the Roman Emperor Nero filled a theater with Aithiopian slaves to demonstrate the wealth and power of Rome to a visiting foreign king.[59]

At the beginning of the 8th century, Arabs took African slaves from the central and eastern portions of the African continent (where they were known as the Zanj) and sold them into markets in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East, for slavery in the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire. 

Beginning in the early 15th century, Europeans captured or bought African slaves from West Africa and brought them first to Europe and then, after the start of European colonization there in the late 15th century, to the Americas. The Atlantic slave trade ended in the 19th century.[60] The dispersal through slave trading represents the largest forced migrations in human history. The economic effect on the African continent proved devastating, as generations of young people were taken from their communities and societies were disrupted. Some communities formed by descendants of African slaves in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have survived to the present day. In other cases, native Ethnic groups of Africans intermarried with non-native Africans, and their descendants blended into the local population.

In the Americas, the confluence of multiple ethnic groups from around the world contributed to multi-ethnic societies. In Central and South America, most people are descended from European, Native American, and African ancestry. In 1888, in Brazil nearly half the population descended from African slaves, the variation of physical characteristics extends across a broad range. In the United States, there was historically a greater European colonial population in relation to African slaves, especially in the Northern Tier. There was considerable racial intermarriage in colonial Virginia, and other forms of racial mixing during the slavery and post-Civil War years. Jim Crow and anti-miscegenation laws passed after the 1863–1877 Reconstruction era in the South in the late-19th century, plus waves of vastly increased immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, maintained much distinction between racial groups. In the early-20th century, to institutionalize racial segregation, most southern states adopted the ""one drop rule"", which defined and recorded anyone with any discernible African ancestry as ""black"", even those of obvious majority native European or of majority-Native-American ancestry.[61]
One of the results of this implementation was the loss of records of Native-identified groups, who were classified only as black because of being mixed-race.[62]

From the very onset of Spanish exploration and colonial activities in the Americas, Africans participated both as voluntary expeditionary and as slave laborers.[50][63] Juan Garrido was such an African conquistador. He crossed the Atlantic as a freedman in the 1510s and participated in the siege of Tenochtitlan.[64] Africans had been present in Asia and Europe long before Columbus's travels. In the late 20th century, Africans began to emigrate to Europe and the Americas in increasing numbers, constituting new African diaspora communities not directly connected with the slave trade.[65]

The African Union defined the African diaspora as ""[consisting] of people of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union."" Its constitutive act declares that it shall ""invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in the building of the African Union.""[55]

Between 1500 and 1900, approximately four million enslaved Africans were transported to island plantations in the Indian Ocean as part of the Indian Ocean slave trade, roughly eight million were shipped northwards as part of the Trans-Saharan slave trade, and roughly eleven million were transported to the Americas as part of the Atlantic slave trade.[66] The diaspora that resulted from the Atlantic slave trade, specifically, may also be referred to as the black diaspora.[67]

Many scholars have challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of African people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that black politics of survival reveal more about the meaning of the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the ""world-historical processes"" of racial colonization, capitalism, and Western domination defines blacks' links to Africa.[68]

In the last decades, studies on the African diaspora have shown an interest in the roles that Africans played in bringing about modernity. This trend also opposes the traditional eurocentric perspective that has dominated history books showing Africans and its diasporans as primitive victims of slavery, and without historical agency. According to historian Patrick Manning, blacks toiled at the center of forces that created the modern world. Paul Gilroy describes the suppression of blackness due to imagined and created ideals of nations as ""cultural insiderism"". Cultural insiderism is used by nations to separate deserving and undeserving groups[69] and requires a ""sense of ethnic difference"" as mentioned in his book The Black Atlantic. Recognizing their contributions offers a comprehensive appreciation of global history.[70]

Cultural and political theorist Richard Iton suggested that diaspora be understood as a ""culture of dislocation"". For Iton, the traditional approach to the African diaspora focuses on the ruptures associated with the Atlantic slave trade and Middle Passage, notions of dispersal, and ""the cycle of retaining, redeeming, refusing, and retrieving 'Africa.'""[71]: 199  This conventional framework for analyzing the diaspora is dangerous, according to Iton, because it presumes that diaspora exists outside of Africa, thus simultaneously disowning and desiring Africa. Further, Iton suggests a new starting principle for the use of diaspora: ""the impossibility of settlement that correlates throughout the modern period with the cluster of disturbances that trouble not only the physically dispersed but those moved without traveling.""[71]: 199–200  Iton adds that this impossibility of settlement—this ""modern matrix of strange spaces—outside the state but within the empire""—renders notions of black citizenship fanciful, and in fact, ""undesirable"". Iton argues that we  citizenship, a state of statelessness thereby deconstructing colonial sites and narratives in an effort to ""de-link geography and power"", putting ""all space into play"" (emphasis added)[71]: 199–200  For Iton, diaspora's potential is represented by a ""rediscursive albeit agonistic field of play that might denaturalize the hegemonic representations of modernity as unencumbered and self-generating and bring into clear view its repressed, colonial subscript"".[71]: 201 

African diaspora populations include:

It is illegal for the French State to collect data on ethnicity and race.

The first Africans in the Americas arrived in the region during the initial period of European colonization. In 1492, Afro-Spanish sailor Pedro Alonso Niño served as a pilot on the voyages of Christopher Columbus; though he returned to the Americas in 1499, Niño did not settle in the region.[113] By the early 16th century, more Africans began to arrive in Spanish colonies in the Americas, sometimes as free people of color, but the majority were enslaved. Demand of African labor increased as the indigenous population of the Americas experienced a massive population decline due to the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases (such as smallpox) to which they had no natural immunity. The Spanish Crown granted asientos (monopoly contracts) to merchants granting them the right to supply enslaved Africans in to Spanish colonies in the Americas, regulating the trade. As other European nations began establishing colonies in the Americas, these new colonies began importing enslaved Africans as well.[114]

During the 17th and 18th centuries, most European colonies in the Caribbean operated on plantation economies fueled by slave labor, and the resulting importation of enslaved Africans meant that Afro-Caribbeans soon far outnumbered their European enslavers in terms of population.[115] Roughly eleven to twelve million enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave trade.[66]

Beginning in 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion by self-emancipated slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue eventually led to the creation of the Republic of Haiti. The new state, led by Jean Jacques Dessalines was the first nation in the Americas to be established from a successful slave revolt and represented a challenge to the existing slave systems in the region.[116] Continuous waves of slave rebellions, such as the Baptist War led by Samuel Sharpe in British Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region, with Great Britain abolishing it in the 1830s. The Spanish colony of Cuba was the last Caribbean island to emancipate its slaves.[117]

During the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people began to assert their cultural, economic and political rights on the world stage. The Jamaican Marcus Garvey formed the UNIA movement in the United States, continuing with Aimé Césaire's négritude movement, which was intended to create a pan-African movement across national lines. From the 1960s, the decolonization of the Americas led to various Caribbean countries gaining their independence from European colonial rule. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as calypso, reggae music, and Rastafari within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as Stokely Carmichael and DJ Kool Herc in the United States, was influential in the creation of the black power and hip hop movements. Influential political theorists such as Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon and Stuart Hall contributed to anti-colonial theory and movements in Africa, as well as cultural developments in Europe.

Several migration waves to the Americas, as well as relocations within the Americas, have brought people of African descent to North America. According to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the first African populations came to North America in the 16th century via Mexico and the Caribbean to the Spanish colonies of Florida, Texas and other parts of the South.[118] Out of the 12 million people from Africa who were shipped to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade,[119] 645,000 were shipped to the British colonies on the North American mainland and the United States.[115] In 2000, African Americans comprised 12.1 percent of the total population in the United States, constituting the largest racial minority group. The African-American population is concentrated in the southern states and urban areas.[120]

In the establishment of the African diaspora, the transatlantic slave trade is often considered the defining element, but people of African descent have engaged in eleven other migration movements involving North America since the 16th century, many being voluntary migrations, although undertaken in exploitative and hostile environments.[118]

In the 1860s, people from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly from West Africa and the Cape Verde Islands, started to arrive in a voluntary immigration wave to seek employment as whalers in Massachusetts. This migration continued until restrictive laws were enacted in 1921 that in effect closed the door on non-Europeans. By that time, men of African ancestry were already a majority in New England's whaling industry, with African Americans working as sailors, blacksmiths, shipbuilders, officers, and owners. The internationalism of whaling crews, including the character Daggoo, an African harpooneer, is recorded in the 1851 novel Moby-Dick. They eventually took their trade to California.[121]

Today 1.7 million people in the United States are descended from voluntary immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, most of whom arrived in the late twentieth century. African immigrants represent 6 percent of all immigrants to the United States and almost 5 percent of the African-American community nationwide. About 57 percent immigrated between 1990 and 2000.[122] Immigrants born in Africa constitute 1.6 percent of the black population. People of the African immigrant diaspora are the most educated population group in the United States—50 percent have bachelor's or advanced degrees, compared to 23 percent of native-born Americans.[123][124] The largest African immigrant communities in the United States are in New York, followed by California, Texas, and Maryland.[122]

Due to the legacy of slavery in the colonial history of the United States, the average African American has a significant European component to his DNA.[125] According to a study conducted in 2011, the African American DNA consists on average of 73.2% West African, 24% European and 0.8% Native American DNA.[125] The European ancestry of African Americans is largely patrilineal with an estimated 19% of African American ancestors being European males, and 5% being European females.[125] The interracial mixing occurred before the Civil War and largely in the American South, beginning during the colonial era.[125]

The states with the highest percentages of people of African descent are Mississippi (36%), and Louisiana (33%). While not a state, the population of the District of Columbia is more than 50% black.[126] Recent African immigrants represent a minority of black people nationwide. The U.S. Bureau of the Census categorizes the population by race based on self-identification.[127] The census surveys have no provision for a ""multiracial"" or ""biracial"" self-identity, but since 2000, respondents may check off more than one box and claim multiple ethnicity that way.

Much of the earliest black presence in Canada came from the newly independent United States after the American Revolution; the British resettled African Americans (known as Black Loyalists) primarily in Nova Scotia. These were primarily former slaves who had escaped to British lines for promised freedom during the Revolution.

Later during the antebellum years, other individual African Americans escaped to Canada, mostly to locations in Southwestern Ontario, via the Underground Railroad, a system supported by both blacks and whites to assist fugitive slaves. After achieving independence, northern states in the U.S. had begun to abolish slavery as early as 1793, but slavery was not abolished in the South until 1865, following the American Civil War.

Black immigration to Canada in the twentieth century consisted mostly of Caribbean descent.[128] As a result of the prominence of Caribbean immigration, the term ""African Canadian"", while sometimes used to refer to the minority of Canadian blacks who have direct African or African-American heritage, is not normally used to denote black Canadians. Blacks of Caribbean origin are usually denoted as ""West Indian Canadian"", ""Caribbean Canadian"" or more rarely ""Afro-Caribbean Canadian"", but there remains no widely used alternative to ""Black Canadian"" which is considered inclusive of the African, Afro-Caribbean, and African-American black communities in Canada.

At an intermediate level, in South America and in the former plantations in and around the Indian Ocean, descendants of enslaved people are a bit harder to define because many people are mixed in demographic proportion to the original slave population. In places that imported relatively few slaves (like Chile), few if any are considered ""black"" today.[129] In places that imported many enslaved people (like Brazil or Dominican Republic), the number is larger, though most identify themselves as being of mixed, rather than strictly African, ancestry.[130] In places like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, blackness is performed in more taboo ways than it is in, say, the United States. The idea behind Trey Ellis Cultural Mulatto comes into play as there are blurred lines between what is considered as black.

In Colombia, the African slaves were first brought to work in the gold mines of the Department of Antioquia. After this was no longer a profitable business, these slaves slowly moved to the Pacific coast, where they have remained unmixed with the white or Indian population until today. The whole Department of Chocó remains a black area. Mixture with white population happened mainly in the Caribbean coast, which is a mestizo area until today. There was also a greater mixture in the south-western departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. In these mestizo areas the African culture has had a great influence.[131]

Some European countries make it illegal to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query along racial lines (e.g. the UK). Of 42 countries surveyed by a European Commission against Racism and Intolerance study in 2007, it was found that 29 collected official statistics on country of birth, 37 on citizenship, 24 on religion, 26 on language, 6 on country of birth of parents, and 22 on nationality or ethnicity.

Estimates of 3 to 5 million of African descent,[89] although one quarter of the Afro-French population live in overseas territories. This number is difficult to estimate because the French census does not use race as a category for ideological reasons.[132]

As of 2020, there were approximately 1,000,000 Afro-Germans.[133] This number is difficult to estimate because the German census does not use race as a category.[134]

Some black people of unknown origin (Though perceived as Ethiopians) once inhabited southern Abkhazia; today, they have been assimilated into the Abkhaz population.

African emigrants to Italy include Italian citizens and residents originally from Africa; immigrants from Africa officially residing in Italy in 2015 numbered over 1 million residents.[135]

There are an estimated 500,000 African or mixed African people in the Netherlands and the Dutch Antilles. They mainly live in the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao and Saint Martin, the latter of which is also partly French-controlled. Many Afro-Dutch people reside in the Netherlands.[136]

As of 2021, there were at least 232,000 people of recent Native African immigrant background living in Portugal. They mainly live in the regions of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra. As Portugal doesn't collect information dealing with ethnicity, the estimate includes only people that, as of 2021, hold the citizenship of an African country or people who have acquired Portuguese citizenship from 2008 to 2021, thus excluding descendants, people of more distant African ancestry or people who have settled in Portugal generations ago and are now Portuguese citizens.[137][138]

As of 2021, there were 1,206,701 Africans. They mainly live in the regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, Madrid and the Canaries.[139]

There are about 2,500,000 (4.2%) people identifying as Black British (not including British Mixed), among which are Afro-Caribbeans. They live mostly in urban areas in England.

The first Black people in Russia were the result of the slave trade of the Ottoman Empire[140] and their descendants still live on the coasts of the Black Sea. Czar Peter the Great was advised by his friend Lefort to bring in Africans to Russia for hard labor. Alexander Pushkin's great-grandfather was the African princeling Abram Petrovich Gannibal, who became Peter's protégé, was educated as a military engineer in France, and eventually became general-en-chef, responsible for the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.[141][142]

During the 1930s fifteen Black American families moved to the Soviet Union as agricultural experts.[143] As African states became independent in the 1960s, the Soviet Union offered their citizens the chance to study in Russia; over 40 years, 400,000 African students came, and some settled there.[140][144]

Afro-Turks are people of Zanj (Bantu) descent living in Turkey. Like the Afro-Abkhazians, they trace their origins to the Ottoman slave trade. Beginning several centuries ago, a number of Africans came to the Ottoman Empire, usually via Zanzibar as Zanj and from places such as present-day Niger, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kenya and Sudan;[145] they settled by the Dalaman, Menderes and Gediz valleys, Manavgat, and Çukurova. In the 19th century, contemporary records mention African quarters of İzmir, including Sabırtaşı, Dolapkuyu, Tamaşalık, İkiçeşmelik, and Ballıkuyu.[146] Africans in Turkey are around 100.000 people.

There are a number of communities in South Asia that are descended from African slaves, traders or soldiers.[147] These communities are the Siddi, Sheedi, Makrani and Sri Lanka Kaffirs.[148] In some cases, they became very prominent, such as Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut, Hoshu Sheedi, Malik Ambar,[149] or the rulers of Janjira State. The Mauritian creole people are the descendants of African slaves similar to those in the Americas.

The Siddi (pronounced [sɪd̪d̪i]), also known as the Sheedi, Sidi, Siddhi, or Habshi, are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan. Members are mostly descended from the Bantu peoples of Southeast Africa, along with Habesha immigrants. Some were merchants, sailors, indentured servants, slaves and mercenaries.[150] The Siddi population is currently estimated at 850,000 individuals, with Karnataka, Gujarat and Telangana states in India and Makran and Karachi in Pakistan[125] as the main population centres.[151] Siddis are primarily Muslims, although some are Hindus and others belong to the Catholic Church.[152]

Although often economically and socially marginalised as a community today, Siddis once ruled Bengal as the Habshi dynasty of the Bengal Sultanate, while the famous Siddi, Malik Ambar, effectively controlled the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. He played a major role, politically and militarily, in Indian history by slowing down  the penetration of the  Delhi-based Mughals into the Deccan Plateau of South central India.[153]

Some Pan-Africanists also consider other peoples as diasporic African peoples. These groups include, among others, Negritos, such as in the case of the peoples of the Malay Peninsula (Orang Asli);[154] New Guinea (Papuans);[155] Andamanese; certain peoples of the Indian subcontinent,[156][157] and the aboriginal peoples of Melanesia and Micronesia.[158][159] Most of these claims are rejected by mainstream ethnologists as pseudoscience and pseudo-anthropology, as part of ideologically motivated Afrocentrist irredentism, touted primarily among some extremist elements in the United States who do not reflect on the mainstream African-American community.[160] Mainstream anthropologists determine that the Andamanese and others are part of a network of autochthonous ethnic groups present in South Asia that trace their genetic ancestry to a migratory sequence that culminated in the Australian Aboriginals rather than from Africa directly.[161][162][163] Genetic testing has shown the Andamani to belong to the Y-Chromosome Haplogroup D-M174, which is in common with Australian Aboriginals and the Ainu people of Japan rather than the actual African diaspora.[164]

 The Kingdom of Aksum was an ancient empire in what is now northern Ethiopia. There were four invasions and subsequent settlements of Aksumites in Himyar, located across the Red Sea in modern-day Yemen. These invasions and settlements led to one of the first large-scale African diasporas in the ancient world.

In 517 AD, the Himyarite king Ma'adikarib was overthrown by Dhu Nuwas, a Jewish leader who began persecuting Christians[165] and confiscating trade goods between Aksum and the Byzantine Empire,[166] both of which were Christian nations.[167] According to the Book of the Himyarites, a man identified as Bishop Thomas journeyed to Aksum to report on the persecution of Christians in Himyar to the Aksumite Kingdom.[168] As a result, the Aksumite king Ahayawa invaded Himyar.[169] Dhu Nuwas fled this first invasion,[170] and at least 580 Aksumite soldiers remained in Himyar.[171] Himyarites who opposed Aksumite settlement united under Dhu Nuwas,[172] and the formerly expelled king traveled back to kill the Aksumite soldiers and continue the oppression of Christians, forcing some settlers back into Aksum.[173]

 In response to Dhu Nuwas's Christian persecution, the new Aksumite king Kaleb first sent a group of Himyarite refugees in his Aksumite kingdom back into Himyar to stir up underground resistance against Dhu Nuwas. These discontented Himyarites then united under nobleman Sumyafa Ashwa.[174] Kaleb successfully invaded Himyar with an Aksumite army in 525 and installed Sumyafa Ashwa to rule.[175] [176] More Aksumite soldiers remained in Himyar to claim land.[177] The Byzantine ruler Justinian learned of this development and sent an ambassador, Julianus, to ally Aksum and Himyar with the Byzantine Empire against Persia. The overtures made by the Byzantine Empire to influence Himyar demonstrate that the Aksumite settlers in Himyar, due to their sustained residence and political organization, constituted a ""stable community in exile"", which historian Carlton Wilson deems a necessary condition to classify a settlement as a diaspora.[178] Justinian had two wishes for this proposed alliance: first, for Aksum to purchase and distribute Indian silk to the Byzantine Empire to undermine Persia economically, and second, for Aksum-ruled Himyar to invade Persia, led by the general Caisus. Both of these plans failed, as Persia's proximity to India made the interruption of their silk trade impossible, and neither Himyar nor Aksum saw value in attacking an adversary that was both stronger and far too distant. Caisus was also responsible for killing a relative of Sumyafa Ashwa's, making Aksumites unwilling to go into battle under him.[179]

A third invasion was prompted by a rebellion of Aksumite soldiers between 532 and 535,[180] led by the former slave[177] and Aksumite commander[180] Abreha, against Sumyafa Ashwa. Kaleb sent 3,000 soldiers to quell this rebellion, led by one of his relatives, but these soldiers joined Abreha's rebellion upon arrival and killed Kaleb's relative. Kaleb sent reinforcements in another attempt to end the rebellion, but his soldiers were defeated and forced to turn around. Following Kaleb's death, Abreha paid tribute to Aksum to reinforce Himyar's independence.[177] The new Himyarite nation consisted of several thousand Aksumite emigrants, serving as one of the earliest examples of a large-scale movement of tropical Africans outside of the continent. Just a century later, Aksum's relationship to this southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula would be pivotal to the introduction of Islam at Mecca and Yathrib (Medina), as evidenced by the naming of Bilal,[181] an Ethiopian,[182] as the first muezzin, and the flight of some of Muhammad's earliest followers from Mecca to Askum.[183]

Although fragmented and separated by land and water, the African Diaspora maintains connection through the use of music.[184][185] This link between the various sects of the African Diaspora is termed by Paul Gilroy as The Black Atlantic.[186] The Black Atlantic is possible because black people have a shared history rooted in oppression that is displayed in Black genres such as rap and reggae.[187] The linkages within the black diaspora formulated through music allows consumers of music and artists to pull from different cultures to combine and create a conglomerate of experiences that reaches across the world.[188]

The term primarily refers to descendants of West and Central Africans enslaved and transported to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries, with significant populations in the United States, Brazil, Colombia, and Haiti. The African Union defines the diaspora as people of African origin living outside Africa who contribute to its development. Historical contexts include ancient slavery in Greece and Rome, Arab slave trades from the 8th century, and European transatlantic slave trade starting in the 15th century. These forced migrations had devastating economic impacts on Africa but led to diverse multi-ethnic societies in the Americas. In modern times, voluntary migrations have formed new diaspora communities globally. Scholars argue that the diaspora represents a movement of liberation against racialization rather than mere dispersion. Contributions of Africans to global history are increasingly recognized, challenging Eurocentric perspectives. Cultural connections within the diaspora are maintained through music and shared histories of oppression.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants and setting the tone for the meeting.\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick round of greetings\n- Outline meeting objectives and expected outcomes"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of the African Diaspora\nTLDR: Discuss the historical background and impact of forced migrations on Africa and the Americas.\n- Historian provides an overview of ancient slavery, Arab slave trades, and European transatlantic slave trade\n- Discussion on economic impacts on Africa\n- Contributions to multi-ethnic societies in the Americas"", ""Scene 3: Cultural Identity and Practices\nTLDR: Explore cultural connections within the diaspora through music, shared histories, and modern migrations.\n- Cultural Anthropologist shares insights on cultural practices and identities\n- Discussion on how music maintains cultural connections\n- Personal anecdotes from participants about cultural experiences"", ""Scene 4: Social Dynamics and Migration Patterns\nTLDR: Analyze social structures affected by migration and diaspora communities globally.\n- Sociologist discusses social dynamics and migration patterns\n- Debate on community resilience vs. systemic issues\n- Participants share personal observations or research findings"", ""Scene 5: Political Influence of the African Diaspora\nTLDR: Examine political movements influenced by the African diaspora.\n- Political Scientist outlines key political movements involving diaspora communities\n- Discussion on global political influence of these movements\n- Spontaneous contributions from participants about current events or historical parallels"", ""Scene 6: Grassroots Impact and Community Engagement\nTLDR: Focus on community advocacy, social justice, and cultural preservation within diaspora communities.\n- Community Leader talks about grassroots efforts for social justice\n- Sharing success stories from different communities\n- Encouraging active participation in ongoing initiatives"", ""Scene 7: Biological Ancestry and Genetic Diversity\nTLDR: Discuss genetic lineage, ancestry, and diversity within African heritage populations.\n - Geneticist explains genetic discoveries related to African ancestry \n - Analogies to clarify complex concepts \n - Open floor for questions about genetic research \n - Participants share personal experiences with genetic testing or ancestry tracing"", ""Scene 8 : Aligning Project Objectives \\ n TLDR : Ensure all departments are aligned with shared project goals .\\ n - Review key project objectives \\ n - Identify any discrepancies or concerns \\ n - Collaborative discussion to align goals across departments"", ""Scene 9 : Resolving Interdepartmental Issues \\ n TLDR : Address any cross-departmental challenges or conflicts .\\ n - Open floor for participants to raise issues \\ n - Brainstorm potential solutions collaboratively \\ n - Agree on action items to resolve conflicts"", ""Scene 10 : Enhancing Interdepartmental Collaboration \\ n TLDR : Foster better collaboration between departments moving forward .\\ n - Share best practices for interdepartmental communication \\ n - Discuss tools or processes that could improve collaboration \\ n - Encourage sharing of resources or expertise between departments"", ""Scene 11 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps \\ n TLDR : Summarize key takeaways , outline next steps , and close the meeting .\\ n - Recap main points discussed during the meeting \\ n - Outline action items assigned to each department \\ n - Set a date for follow-up meeting if necessary""]",">>Community Leader: Hey everyone! It's great to see you all here today. Our main goal is to discuss how grassroots movements can drive social change and strengthen our community bonds.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Hi, everyone! I'm excited about this discussion. From my research, it's clear that grassroots movements are crucial in fostering community resilience. For instance, I've seen how local initiatives can empower communities from the ground up.

>>Historian: Good morning! Building on that, history shows us that grassroots movements have been instrumental in shaping societies throughout the African diaspora. Think about the abolition of slavery or the civil rights movements—these efforts highlight the power of collective action.

>>Sociologist: Absolutely! And from a sociological perspective, these movements often arise from shared experiences within marginalized communities. They not only push for social change but also create a strong sense of belonging among participants.

>>Political Scientist: Right, and politically speaking, grassroots movements have been powerful in mobilizing communities for systemic change. How do we leverage these historical lessons to tackle today's issues within the African diaspora?

>>Geneticist: Morning everyone! I think understanding our genetic heritage can also play a role here by connecting people on a deeper level. It’s another way to strengthen our identity and unity within these movements.

>>Community Leader: Great points all around! So let's dive into specifics—what are some successful strategies from history that we can adapt for today's challenges? Any examples come to mind? 
 >>Historian: The transatlantic slave trade not only devastated African societies economically but also led to the creation of vibrant, multi-ethnic communities in the Americas. These forced migrations contributed to a unique blend of cultures and resilience among African-descended populations.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely, it's fascinating how these tragic events led to such rich and diverse cultural identities. African traditions mixed with indigenous and European influences, creating the unique practices we see today. This blending has really shaped modern cultural identities.

>>Sociologist: I agree with you on that point. From a sociological perspective, while these events caused significant disruptions, they also fostered incredible resilience within African-descended communities. The way traditions have blended over time is remarkable. How do you think this ongoing evolution impacts social cohesion in our multi-ethnic societies?

>>Political Scientist: That's a great question. Politically, understanding these historical migrations is crucial because they influenced political movements within the African diaspora. The resilience built by these communities often translated into powerful grassroots movements challenging systemic inequalities.

>>Community Leader: Exactly! In our community, we've seen firsthand how historical experiences have fostered unity and purpose. For instance, during our annual cultural festival, we celebrate our heritage through music and dance passed down through generations. It's a reminder of our strength and solidarity as we continue to address systemic inequalities today.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, the transatlantic slave trade had profound economic impacts on Africa—entire generations were uprooted, leading to significant loss of human capital and disruption of societal structures. This devastation was compounded by other forms of slavery throughout history.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: These disruptions didn't just affect economies; they also shaped cultural practices that thrive today. For example, many African-descended communities have preserved their identity through music and oral traditions despite these challenges.

>>Sociologist: Yes, those cultural practices are vital for maintaining identity and unity among African-descended communities. They serve as connections to their roots and means of resilience against adversity.

>>Political Scientist: And politically speaking, this sense of identity has been crucial for mobilizing against injustices even today. Historical experiences have definitely played a role in shaping contemporary political activism within the diaspora.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! Our community's efforts to address current issues are deeply rooted in our shared history and culture. By remembering where we come from, we're better equipped to tackle today's challenges together. 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, the way music travels and evolves within the African diaspora is like a living thread connecting us all. From traditional rhythms to modern beats, it's fascinating how these sounds carry our stories and identities across generations.

>>Historian: Absolutely! The history of music in the African diaspora shows incredible resilience and adaptability. From spirituals sung by enslaved Africans to jazz and blues in the early 20th century, these musical forms not only preserved cultural identity but also served as means of resistance and expression. It's amazing how these traditions have evolved yet retained their core essence!

>>Sociologist: Yeah, from a sociological perspective, it's interesting how migration patterns within the African diaspora have not only kept cultural identities alive but also created new forms of social cohesion. How do these evolving musical traditions reflect communities' strategies for maintaining heritage while integrating into new environments?

>>Community Leader: I mean, let me tell you, the power of music in our community is like a heartbeat that keeps us connected across distances and generations. It's not just about preserving our heritage but also about creating new forms of expression that resonate with our experiences today. We must stand together to ensure these cultural practices continue to thrive!

>>Political Scientist: Politically speaking, the role of music within the African diaspora goes beyond cultural preservation; it serves as a powerful tool for political mobilization and resistance. For example, during recent protests, we've seen how songs can unite people and amplify their voices.

>>Historian (interjecting): Exactly! And historically speaking, during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, songs like 'We Shall Overcome' became anthems of resistance and unity. This shows how music transcends mere entertainment to become a powerful medium for social change.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Historically, in many cultures within the African diaspora, music wasn't just entertainment but vital for daily life and survival. It's amazing how these musical traditions have adapted despite challenges faced by our ancestors.

>>Sociologist (nodding): Right! And from my research—

>>Community Leader (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! I've seen firsthand how young people use music as both an anchor to their roots and wings for innovation.

>>Sociologist (continuing): Absolutely! My research shows that these musical traditions help keep our culture alive and bring people together. For instance, integrating African rhythms into various genres worldwide reflects maintaining heritage while embracing new contexts. How do you think this adaptability influences younger generations within the diaspora?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's amazing how these musical traditions preserve our heritage while serving as bridges between generations. Imagine young people remixing traditional African rhythms with modern beats—it's like they're creating dialogue between past and present. 
 >>Sociologist: You know, it's not just about keeping traditions alive but also about how these communities adapt to new places and challenges. My research shows that migration patterns really shape social bonds and identities. What do you think happens in different diaspora communities?

>>Historian: Yeah, that's a good point. If we look at the African diaspora, there's this mix of forced displacement and voluntary movement over time. These migrations have shaped social structures and built resilience. How do you see this historical strength playing out today?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Absolutely! Think about it—African diaspora communities don't just hold onto their cultural practices; they blend them with new ones from their surroundings. It's amazing how they adapt despite all the obstacles. How does this blending affect younger generations?

>>Community Leader: I can tell you firsthand, our community's strength is incredible! We see grassroots efforts preserving culture while creating a sense of belonging. We need to keep supporting these efforts so they can continue to grow.

>>Political Scientist: From a political angle, it's important to see that the adaptability of these communities isn't just cultural—it's political too. They often start grassroots movements to tackle systemic issues and fight for their rights. How do these political actions shape their identity and unity?

>>Historian: Right, historically speaking, the African diaspora has always adapted and thrived despite challenges—from the slave trade to modern migrations. This adaptability definitely influences today's political efforts.

>>Political Scientist: Exactly! These grassroots movements aren't just reactions—they're proactive steps reshaping politics and pushing for change. How do you think these actions affect how diaspora communities are seen in their host countries?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's really interesting how young people in these communities create hybrid identities by mixing their heritage with their current environment. How does this impact their sense of belonging?

>>Historian: Indeed! From a historical perspective—

>>Geneticist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—I was wondering about something related—how does genetic diversity play into all this? Does it help with resilience or adaptability?

>>Historian: Great question! Genetic diversity can definitely contribute by offering a range of traits that help individuals adapt to different pressures.

>>Cultural Anthropologist (continuing): As I was saying earlier...the younger generations create hybrid identities which impact both belongingness and community cohesion. 
 >>Political Scientist: We need to look at how past movements can guide today's fight for justice. The political movements within the African diaspora have historically been a powerful force for change. From the Haitian Revolution to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, these movements have not only sought to address systemic injustices but also to reclaim cultural identity and autonomy.

>>Historian: That's a great point. The Haitian Revolution is a prime example of this. It not only challenged colonial powers but also inspired liberation efforts across the Americas and beyond. Another significant event was the Pan-African Congresses, which played a crucial role in decolonization efforts throughout Africa and the Caribbean.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: And when we look at cultural practices, they’ve been a source of resilience and unity within the African diaspora. These practices preserve heritage while adapting to new environments, creating hybrid identities that are both unique and deeply rooted in tradition. For instance, music and dance forms like reggae or samba have become symbols of cultural pride and resistance.

>>Sociologist: Absolutely, migration patterns within the African diaspora have reshaped social structures in host countries too. The resilience and adaptability of these communities often lead to significant contributions in both cultural and political spheres, creating a dynamic interplay between identity preservation and integration.

>>Community Leader: Grassroots movements within our community have always been a beacon of hope and resilience. Local initiatives like community gardens or cultural festivals not only preserve our heritage but also empower us politically. We must stand together to harness this power for broader social change!

>>Geneticist (interrupting): I agree with what you're saying about resilience. From a genetic standpoint, there's incredible diversity within these communities that adds another layer to their strength.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! And considering our genetic diversity only strengthens our local initiatives like community gardens or cultural festivals even more.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's amazing how these cultural practices not only preserve heritage but also adapt and evolve in new environments. This adaptability often leads to hybrid identities that are both unique and deeply rooted in tradition, significantly influencing political movements and social cohesion.

>>Historian: Indeed! The Haitian Revolution dismantled colonial rule and set a precedent for future liberation movements across the globe. Events like this highlight the profound impact that diaspora communities can have on global political landscapes. 
 >>Community Leader: The power of grassroots movements lies in their ability to mobilize communities from the ground up. In our community, we've seen success with initiatives like community gardens and cultural festivals that not only preserve our heritage but also empower individuals to take action for social justice.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: It's fascinating how these movements create a strong sense of community and cultural identity. Imagine a community garden where people grow food and share stories, recipes, and traditions. It's like planting seeds of heritage that bloom into social justice!

>>Sociologist: As a sociologist, I find it interesting how these initiatives foster social justice while creating a sense of belonging within diaspora communities. When people participate in community gardens or cultural festivals, they reinforce their collective identity and resilience against systemic challenges.

>>Historian: Historically, grassroots movements within the African diaspora are rooted in resilience and collective action. From abolitionist efforts during slavery to civil rights movements in the 20th century, these initiatives have always been about more than just survival—they've been about reclaiming identity and agency.

>>Political Scientist: Politically speaking, it's crucial to understand that these movements are not just about cultural preservation but also about reclaiming political agency. When communities engage in initiatives like community gardens or cultural festivals, they resist systemic oppression and assert their right to self-determination.

>>Geneticist: It's fascinating how the diversity within African diaspora communities contributes to their resilience. The genetic variations we see today are a testament to centuries of migration, intermarriage, and cultural blending. These markers connect individuals to their roots while enhancing their ability to thrive in diverse environments.

>>Community Leader: Exactly! And these efforts aren't just symbolic; they're practical steps towards real change. For example, our community garden project has provided fresh produce for families who otherwise wouldn't have access to it.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's a great point! Can you share more about how the community garden project has impacted local families?

>>Community Leader: Sure! We've seen families come together over gardening activities, which has strengthened neighborhood bonds. Plus, having access to fresh produce has improved nutrition for many households.

>>Sociologist: That’s wonderful! My research shows that such grassroots initiatives do more than just preserve heritage; they actively combat systemic challenges by fostering a strong sense of identity and belonging.

>>Historian: Indeed! Grassroots movements have always been about reclaiming identity and agency. During abolitionist efforts in the 19th century, communities came together to fight for freedom and justice—creating legacies that continue to inspire us today. 
 >>Geneticist: Um, consider this, the genetic diversity within African heritage populations is unparalleled. It's fascinating how various migrations and intermixing over centuries have created a rich tapestry of genetic variation. This diversity not only contributes to physical traits but also to resilience against diseases and adaptability to different environments.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Yeah, it's like each community has its own unique story. These cultural practices have evolved and adapted over time, influenced by migrations and intermixing. It's amazing how these evolving narratives shape our sense of identity today.

>>Historian: Absolutely! The historical context of African migrations is crucial in understanding the genetic diversity we see today. These movements were about survival, yes, but also about cultural exchange and adaptation. How do you think this rich history of migration has influenced modern African diaspora communities?

>>Sociologist: From my research, um, it's clear that migration patterns have a profound impact on social structures within diaspora communities. The blending of different cultural practices often leads to the creation of new identities that can strengthen community bonds and foster resilience. But I'm curious—how do you think these evolving identities influence political engagement?

>>Political Scientist: Well, when individuals embrace their diverse backgrounds, they often become more politically active. They advocate for policies that reflect their experiences. For example, I've seen people push for more inclusive education systems that acknowledge their heritage.

>>Community Leader: I mean, from what I've seen in our community work, embracing these diverse backgrounds really empowers people to take action. It’s like they find strength in their varied histories which fuels their drive for social justice.

>>Geneticist: Exactly! And if we look at it from a genetic perspective again—um—this diversity goes down to our very DNA. Each wave of migration brought new genes into the mix, enhancing our overall genetic pool.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Right! And those new genes came with stories and traditions that blended into the existing fabric of the community. You know what I mean? It's fascinating how these evolving narratives shape our sense of identity today.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, these migrations were driven by both necessity and opportunity—leading to rich exchanges of knowledge and traditions. How do you think these historical patterns continue to influence contemporary cultural practices within the diaspora?

>>Sociologist: Well... from my research perspective again—um—the impact on social structures is significant. These hybrid identities often lead to stronger community bonds because people feel connected through shared experiences despite their diverse backgrounds.

>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! And when it comes to political engagement—consider this—embracing such hybrid identities can lead individuals to advocate for more inclusive policies that reflect their multifaceted experiences.

>>Community Leader: Yeah! Like when we organize events or campaigns in our community—you know—it’s always about bringing together those diverse voices which makes us stronger as a whole. 
 >>Sociologist: We need to spot any issues with our goals early so we can fix them together. This way, we can keep everyone on the same page.

>>Historian: Absolutely. In past projects, clear communication has been key to success. For example, during the civil rights movement, regular check-ins helped maintain unity and focus. We should consider similar strategies.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's a great point. Maybe we could have storytelling sessions where each department shares their unique insights and challenges. It could help us understand different perspectives and work better together.

>>Political Scientist: I agree with both of you. From a political standpoint, it's important that our goals are not just aligned but also harmonized with our overall mission. How about we look at successful movements for inspiration on how to foster collaboration?

>>Community Leader: Yes, engaging everyone is crucial. In my community work, we've seen how regular workshops can bring people together. What if we held bi-weekly meetings where each department updates us on their progress and challenges? It would keep us all in sync.

>>Geneticist: While we're talking about aligning objectives, let's not forget how biological diversity might affect our outcomes. Different communities may respond differently to interventions, so we need to consider this in our planning.

>>Historian: Good point! Clear communication and shared objectives are essential. Let's make sure we're addressing any issues head-on and fostering unity among our team.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Right! And those storytelling sessions could really help bridge gaps between departments by sharing unique cultural insights.

>>Sociologist: Exactly! Identifying potential issues early allows us to address them collaboratively and stay aligned.

>>Political Scientist: Yes, but let's also draw from historical examples of successful movements to guide us in fostering unity within our team.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! Regular check-ins have worked wonders in my community for bridging gaps and aligning objectives. Let's set up a rotating schedule where each department leads a discussion on their progress and challenges every two weeks. 
 >>Sociologist: Based on what I've found, catching issues early is key to keeping things on track. How about we have each department send a quick update on their progress and any problems before our bi-weekly meetings? That way, we can tackle potential conflicts head-on.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, clear communication and shared goals have been crucial for the success of many movements. Maybe we could try rotating who leads these meetings to get different perspectives and make sure everyone feels included.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: That's interesting. We could also think about ways to share our unique cultural practices during these updates. It might help us understand each other better and work together more smoothly.

>>Community Leader: I like that idea! And if we set up a shared platform where departments can post their updates in real-time, it would help us address issues as they come up and celebrate successes together.

>>Political Scientist: Yeah, effective communication is definitely important. The rotating leadership idea sounds good too—it would keep things fresh and ensure everyone's voice is heard.

>>Geneticist: I see your point. Just remember that different communities might respond differently to our strategies. We should consider those differences when we're planning solutions.

>>Sociologist: Right! And having those reports ahead of time will give us a chance to look them over before the meeting, making everything run more smoothly.

>>Historian: Exactly! Rotating leadership has worked well in the past—like during the Civil Rights Movement—where different leaders brought new energy and ideas. It could really help us here too.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Instead of a 'Cultural Day,' maybe we could have regular team-building activities or workshops where departments share their unique practices. It would build understanding without taking away from our main focus.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! A shared platform for real-time updates would not only help with problem-solving but also boost morale by making sure everyone feels heard and valued.

>>Political Scientist: And aligning our goals with historical examples can guide us in the right direction while keeping everyone on the same page.

>>Geneticist: Actually... um... considering genetic diversity is important too because different groups might need tailored approaches based on their specific needs.

>>Sociologist: Makes sense! So we're looking at regular reports from each department before meetings, rotating leadership roles, and incorporating some form of cultural exchange?

>>Historian: Yes, but let's make sure everyone understands why these strategies worked historically so they can see the value in them today.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Exactly! By sharing our unique practices through team-building activities or workshops, we'll create stronger connections across departments without losing focus on our goals.

>>Community Leader: Imagine this—if every voice is heard through real-time updates on our shared platform—it'll significantly boost morale! 
 >>Sociologist: I think implementing real-time updates could really improve our communication between departments. It would help us be more transparent and accountable, which is always a good thing.

>>Historian: That's a good point. If we look at how quick information sharing helped during the Civil Rights Movement, it shows that timely updates can really unite people and prompt action. We could definitely use that kind of efficiency here.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Yeah, and from what I've seen in different cultures, storytelling is a great way to share knowledge and build understanding. Maybe we could incorporate some form of storytelling in our meetings to help bridge gaps between departments.

>>Community Leader: Absolutely! In our community, having real-time updates would be a huge improvement. Imagine if we could instantly share progress and challenges with each other—it would make a big difference.

>>Geneticist: I agree, but let's not forget the importance of diversity in our communication strategies. Just like genetic diversity helps organisms adapt, varied ways of communicating can make us more resilient and innovative.

>>Political Scientist: True, but we should also consider the political aspect. Real-time updates can mobilize departments towards common goals by creating a sense of urgency and shared purpose.

>>Sociologist: Exactly. My research shows that when departments are transparent with each other, it fosters shared responsibility and proactive problem-solving.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: And if we share our unique challenges and successes through stories, it could really enhance understanding and collaboration among us.

>>Historian: Right. The key takeaway from historical movements is that rapid information sharing was crucial for organizing efforts effectively. We can learn from that to improve our own interdepartmental collaboration today.
