Civil Rights Law,"Civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. They ensure one's entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of society and the state.

Civil rights generally include ensuring peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, and safety, protection from discrimination, the right to privacy, the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.

Political rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote. These rights also must follow the legal norm as in they must have the force of law and fit into the system of administrative justice. A key feature in modern society is that the more a state can guarantee political rights of citizens the better the states relations are with its citizens.[1]

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights.[2] They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be ""first-generation rights"", and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.

The phrase ""civil rights"" is a translation of Latin jus civis (right of the citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (libertas) or servile (servitus), but they all had rights in law.[3] After the Edict of Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however, in 380, the Edict of Thessalonica required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Nicene Christianity.[4] Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of Kett's Rebellion (1549), ""all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding.""[5]

In the 17th century, English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The Parliament of England adopted the English Bill of Rights in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by George Mason and James Madison when drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. The Virginia declaration heavily influenced the U.S. Bill of Rights (1789).[6]

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a ""civil disability"". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase ""civil rights"" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the House of Commons, support for civil rights was divided, with many  politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 restored their civil rights.[7]

In the United States, the term civil rights has been associated with the civil rights movement (1954–1968), which fought against racism.[8] The movement also fought segregation and Jim Crow laws and this fight took place in the streets, in public places, in government, and in the courts including the Supreme Court.[9] The civil rights movement was also not the only movement fighting for civil rights as The Black Panthers were also a group focused on fighting racism and Jim Crow.

Other things that civil rights have been associated with are not just race but also rights of Transgender and other LGBTQ individuals. These have been fights over sexuality instead of race and focused around whether these individuals may access certain spaces like bathrooms according to their sexual identity or biological sex. Gavin Grimm's fight in Virginia over whether he could use the bathroom of his choice is a well known case in these civil right fights.[10]

Another issue in civil rights has been the issue with police brutality in certain communities especially minority communities. This has been seen as another way for minority groups to be oppressed and their rights infringed upon. Outrage has also been a massive result of incidents caught on tape of police abusing and in some cases causing the deaths of people from minority groups such as African Americans. That is why to address the issue has been accountability to police engaging in such conduct as a way to deter other officers from committing similar actions.[11]

T. H. Marshall notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are constitutional rights and are included in a bill of rights or similar document. They are also defined in international human rights instruments, such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected. However, most democracies worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be natural rights. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his A Summary View of the Rights of British America that ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.""

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. Although in many countries citizens are considered to have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons. One thing to mention is that if individuals have fewer political rights than are they more likely to commit political violence such as in countries where individual rights are highly restricted.[12] That is why it is important for countries to protect the political rights of all citizens including minority groups. This extends to racial, ethnic, tribal, and religious groups. By granting them the same rights it helps reduce the risk of political violence breaking out.[13]

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.[14]

Custom also plays a role. Implied or unenumerated rights are rights that courts may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the right to privacy in the United States, and the Ninth Amendment explicitly shows that other rights are also protected.

The United States Declaration of Independence states that people have unalienable rights including ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness"". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty , and property.[15]

Some thinkers have argued that the concepts of self-ownership and cognitive liberty affirm rights to choose the food one eats,[16][17] the medicine one takes,[18][19][20] and the habit one indulges.[21][22][23]

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of laws, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even social unrest may ensue.

Civil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment.[24][full citation needed] Consciously modeled after the Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.[25][full citation needed]

Worldwide, several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims.[26] In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals, or from corporations—e.g., in what way should employment discrimination in the private sector be dealt with?

Political theory deals with civil and political rights. Robert Nozick and John Rawls expressed competing visions in Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia and Rawls' A Theory of Justice. Other influential authors in the area include Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, and Jean Edward Smith.

First-generation rights, often called ""blue"" rights,[citation needed] deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly individualistic: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, (in some countries) the right to keep and bear arms, freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, and voting rights. They were pioneered in the seventeenth and eighteenth-century during the Age of Enlightenment. Political theories associated with the English, American, and French revolutions were codified in the English Bill of Rights in 1689 (a restatement of Rights of Englishmen, some dating back to Magna Carta in 1215) and more fully in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 and the United States Bill of Rights in 1791.[27][28]

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.

There are current organizations that exist to protect people's civil and political rights in case they are infringed upon. The ACLU, founded in 1920, is a well-known non-profit organization that helps to preserve freedom of speech and works to change policy.[29] Another organization is the NAACP, founded in 1909, which focuses on protecting the civil rights of minorities. The NRA is a civil rights group founded in 1871 that primarily focuses on protecting the right to bear arms. These organizations serve a variety of causes, one being the AFL–CIO, which is America's union that represent the working-class people nationwide.[30]

Let's talk about how we can advocate for civil rights effectively today. Our agenda includes discussing community outreach programs, legal support initiatives, and policy lobbying efforts.
>>Human Rights Activist: Hey! Great point on advocacy strategies. We also need to cover transparency and accountability while empowering marginalized communities through these initiatives.
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely agree with both of you. Understanding these aspects from a political perspective helps us strengthen democratic governance and build trust in our institutions.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Right, let's dive into the specifics. For community outreach, we need to identify key areas where civil rights education is lacking and develop targeted campaigns.
>>Human Rights Activist: Yes, and for legal support initiatives, we should consider partnering with local organizations to provide pro bono services to those who can't afford representation.
>>Political Scientist: And when it comes to policy lobbying efforts, it's crucial that we engage with lawmakers and use data-driven arguments to push for reforms that protect civil rights. 
 >>Civil Rights Lawyer: Roman law really set some important precedents for civil rights. It provided legal protections to citizens that influenced many later documents.
>>Human Rights Activist: That's true! And it’s amazing how those early ideas were expanded globally with major documents like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ensuring protections like freedom from torture and the right to a fair trial.
>>Political Scientist: Exactly, and don't forget how influential American documents like the Virginia Declaration of Rights were in shaping our own Bill of Rights. These historical foundations are key to understanding today's civil rights.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Indeed! The progression from Roman law to the English Bill of Rights and then the Virginia Declaration of Rights shows how legal interpretations have evolved over time.
>>Human Rights Activist: Right, those early laws paved the way for global standards we see today. Understanding these foundations is crucial if we're going to effectively advocate for universal civil rights now.
>>Political Scientist: Yes, plus it's fascinating how these principles evolved through various declarations and covenants. Each step built upon previous ideas, expanding protections further each time. 
 >>Human Rights Activist: Absolutely, Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent approach was revolutionary. But how do we adapt these strategies to today's digital age?
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: That's a great point! Social media has changed the landscape of activism. We need to find ways to leverage these platforms effectively.
>>Political Scientist: Right, while their contributions are undeniably significant, we must also consider how nonviolent resistance showed moral high ground and exposed injustices. How can we use similar tactics today?
>>Human Rights Activist: It's amazing how figures like Rosa Parks played crucial roles too. Her courage inspired so many people. What can we learn from her actions for our current challenges?
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Indeed! And let's not forget recent movements like Black Lives Matter that have used social media effectively to mobilize communities. How do we ensure these strategies are integrated into contemporary advocacy?
>>Political Scientist: Fascinating! While Malcolm X and groups like the Black Panther Party had different approaches emphasizing self-defense and empowerment through direct action, they also highlighted systemic injustices effectively. How do we balance these diverse strategies in contemporary movements?
>>Human Rights Activist: You know, it's incredible how diverse approaches from figures like Malcolm X complemented nonviolent resistance by highlighting different aspects of systemic injustice.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Absolutely! The contributions of various figures shaped our legal landscape significantly. How can we integrate their lessons into current advocacy efforts?
>>Political Scientist: From a practical perspective, the evolution of civil rights movements shows a dynamic interplay between grassroots activism and institutional change. Diverse strategies broadened civil rights advocacy scope while highlighting multifaceted systemic injustices. How do we ensure contemporary movements embrace such methodologies without losing focus on current issues? 
 >>Civil Rights Lawyer: To address police brutality effectively, we need robust accountability measures. This includes independent oversight bodies and transparent investigations into misconduct. Justice must prevail, and equal rights for all under the law.
>>Human Rights Activist: Absolutely, organizations like the ACLU and NAACP are crucial in addressing police brutality. They provide a voice for those who often go unheard and push for accountability measures that are essential to ensuring justice. We must act now to support these efforts!
>>Political Scientist: From a political standpoint, the issue of police brutality against minority communities can be seen as a failure in institutional mechanisms meant to ensure accountability and protect civil rights. We've seen time and again that biases in the system lead to repeated violations without adequate redress.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Right! The interplay between law enforcement practices and civil rights protections does reveal deeper structural issues. To address these, we need accountability measures that are not only robust but also effectively implemented.
>>Human Rights Activist: It's clear that organizations like the ACLU and NAACP have been pivotal in pushing for accountability measures. But we also need to ensure that these measures are effectively implemented at all levels of law enforcement. How can we make sure independent oversight bodies have the authority and resources they need?
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: To ensure that independent oversight bodies have what they need, we must advocate for legislative reforms that mandate their establishment and funding. This includes pushing for laws requiring transparency in investigations and accountability for misconduct.
[Notification sound]
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Sorry about that—where was I? Oh yes—while legislative reforms are essential... Actually, let's take a moment to refocus on our main points.
>>Political Scientist: Interesting! While legislative reforms are essential—
>>Human Rights Activist: Exactly! And we need those reforms now!
>>Political Scientist: —we must also critically evaluate their effectiveness in practice. Independent oversight bodies should deter misconduct through transparent investigations and legal consequences. However, systemic biases often undermine these processes.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Indeed! But do you think legislation alone is enough? What about community involvement?
>>Human Rights Activist: Empowering oversight bodies is crucial but addressing systemic biases undermining their effectiveness is equally important. How can we ensure these bodies are truly independent? 
 >>Civil Rights Lawyer: We need clear laws to make sure oversight bodies can work independently without political interference. This includes unbiased funding sources and protection from political meddling.
>>Political Scientist: Studies show that when people know their rights are protected through these frameworks, they're less likely to turn to violence. It's crucial for stability and trust in governance.
>>Human Rights Activist: I completely agree; ensuring these frameworks are transparent is key. When citizens see how their rights are safeguarded, it builds trust and reduces the likelihood of unrest.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Exactly! And we must ensure these legal mechanisms provide fair trials, due process, and the right to seek redress. These elements significantly reduce the chances of political violence.
>>Political Scientist: That's a great point about transparency building trust. How do you think we can ensure these mechanisms remain accessible to everyone?
>>Human Rights Activist: We need to make sure information about these frameworks is widely available and easy to understand. Regular updates and community outreach can help keep everyone informed.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: I agree with what you said about empirical evidence showing reduced violence when rights are protected. We need those legal mechanisms in place and actively maintained.
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely, maintaining these frameworks is just as important as establishing them. Consistent protection of rights fosters security and reduces political violence over time. 
 >>Human Rights Activist: You know, I've seen firsthand how community outreach can really make a difference. In one project I worked on in rural India, we organized workshops to educate villagers about their rights and the legal tools available to them. The transformation was amazing! People started standing up against local corruption and demanding justice.

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: That's incredible! I had a similar experience in a case involving police misconduct here in the States. Once the community understood their rights, there was a significant increase in documented complaints and demands for accountability. It's inspiring to see people take charge of their own protection.

>>Political Scientist: Absolutely, when communities are educated about their rights, they become more engaged in civic activities. This engagement fosters accountability and strengthens democratic governance by ensuring active participation in the political process. But I'm curious, how do we ensure these educational initiatives are sustained over time?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Sustaining these initiatives definitely requires continuous funding and engaging local leaders to champion the cause. Integrating civil rights education into school curriculums is also crucial. What do you think about using technology to enhance these efforts?

>>Human Rights Activist: Technology can be a game-changer! Online platforms can reach wider audiences and provide ongoing support for those seeking justice. For example, we've used social media campaigns to keep people informed and motivated.

>>Political Scientist: Leveraging technology is key, but it comes with challenges like ensuring access and digital literacy. How do we address these potential hurdles while maintaining long-term impact?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Continuous funding is crucial, no doubt about that. Engaging local leaders helps sustain momentum too. And integrating civil rights education into school curriculums ensures future generations are informed from an early age.

>>Human Rights Activist: Right! Plus, collaboration with local organizations ensures that the initiatives remain relevant and effective over time. We've partnered with NGOs for resources and expertise which has been really beneficial.

>>Political Scientist: That's a great point! Regular evaluations of programs help adapt them based on feedback as well. But what other strategies can we employ to maintain these educational initiatives?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Partnering with NGOs is definitely one strategy. Another approach could be creating community advisory boards that regularly review progress and suggest improvements based on real-world experiences.

>>Human Rights Activist: Yes! And sharing success stories can inspire others too—like when villagers stood up against corruption after our workshops—it shows what's possible when people are empowered.

>>Political Scientist: Those stories are powerful indeed! They not only motivate but also provide practical examples of what works. Speaking of which, have any of you faced challenges where things didn't go as planned? How did you handle it?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Oh definitely! There were times when funding fell through or local leaders were resistant at first. We had to get creative—sometimes holding smaller meetings or finding alternative sources of support until things picked up again.

>>Human Rights Activist: Same here! Persistence is key; sometimes it's just about finding new ways to engage people or tweaking our approach based on feedback from the community itself. 
 >>Political Scientist: You know, when we talk about coordinating tasks remotely, it's crucial to consider how these tools work in real-world scenarios. Virtual collaboration tools can facilitate communication and task management if they're integrated with clear protocols and regular check-ins. But how do we ensure these strategies are effective for diverse teams?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Right! To ensure effective remote teamwork, we need practical solutions. For instance, using project management tools like Trello or Asana can help track progress and assign tasks efficiently. Additionally, implementing virtual stand-up meetings can foster accountability and keep everyone aligned with the project's goals.

>>Human Rights Activist: It's interesting how virtual collaboration tools can transform remote teamwork. Using platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time communication can boost team morale and keep everyone connected. But what about integrating these tools with project management software to streamline task assignments and deadlines?

>>Political Scientist: Integrating project management tools with communication platforms can definitely streamline tasks. However, without clear protocols and regular evaluations, these integrations might not be as efficient as we'd hope. How do we make sure these strategies adapt to different team dynamics?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Absolutely! Flexibility is key in our protocols to fit various team dynamics. For example—

[Sound of a notification ping]

>>Human Rights Activist: Sorry about that! My notifications are going off.

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: No problem! As I was saying—using tools like Zoom for virtual meetings can be complemented with asynchronous methods such as email or shared documents on Google Drive. This allows team members to contribute at their own pace while maintaining overall project coherence.

>>Human Rights Activist: Integrating tools like Slack with project management software creates a seamless workflow! It's like having a virtual office where everyone knows their roles and deadlines. But how do we ensure that these integrations are user-friendly for all team members?

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Indeed! To make sure these integrations are user-friendly, intuitive design and comprehensive training should be prioritized. For example—

[Sound of another notification ping]

>>Political Scientist: Looks like we're all getting notifications today!

[Laughter from participants]

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Right? Anyway—platforms like Slack and Trello should offer tutorials and support to help team members navigate their features effectively. How can we further enhance accessibility for diverse teams?

>>Human Rights Activist: One challenge is varying tech literacy levels among team members. Tailored training programs could help bridge this gap by providing step-by-step guides or one-on-one sessions.

>>Political Scientist: That's a great point! We also need to consider language barriers or different time zones that might affect communication flow.

>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Exactly! Ensuring that our tools have multilingual support and flexible scheduling options could make a big difference in inclusivity. 
 >>Human Rights Activist: You know, speaking of inclusivity, I recently read about a community project where they used art and storytelling to bridge cultural gaps. Isn't that amazing? It really shows how creative approaches can foster social cohesion.
>>Political Scientist: That sounds great! How did they use art specifically?
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: I attended a mural painting event recently—it's incredible how these activities spark conversations about justice and equality.
>>Human Rights Activist: Speaking of creative approaches, I've been thinking about how we could use murals depicting civil rights movements to educate and inspire people. Wouldn't that be powerful?
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! Using art in this way is like using soft power—it helps people connect without any direct confrontation.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Right! And at the mural event I attended, it was clear how art could bring people together from different backgrounds to discuss important issues like justice and equality. 
 >>Human Rights Activist: Art has this incredible power to unite and inspire. Moving forward, we should focus on identifying key metrics for evaluating the impact of these creative methods. For instance, we could look at how community engagement increases through local art projects.
>>Political Scientist: Absolutely! From a political standpoint, it's crucial that we establish clear metrics to evaluate the impact of these creative methods. Research shows that such evaluations not only validate our efforts but also guide future initiatives effectively. Maybe we can start by analyzing past successful campaigns?
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Indeed! As we move forward, it's imperative that we not only establish these metrics but also ensure they are adaptable to the unique needs of each community. This adaptability will allow us to tailor our approaches effectively and measure success in a way that truly reflects the impact on civil rights advocacy. What challenges do you think we'll face in adapting these metrics?
>>Human Rights Activist: Good point! We need to make sure our collaboration with local artists is dynamic and responsive to feedback. Perhaps forming committees within each community could help us gather more specific insights and adjust our strategies accordingly.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: To ensure these metrics are effective, we must also consider the legal frameworks that support their implementation. This involves setting clear guidelines and following civil rights laws to protect and empower communities. How do you think we can best communicate these guidelines?
>>Political Scientist: Right! Establishing clear metrics is essential from a political standpoint. Research shows such evaluations validate our efforts and guide future initiatives effectively. We could use surveys or focus groups to get detailed feedback from community members.
>>Civil Rights Lawyer: Absolutely! We need to consider legal frameworks supporting their implementation—setting guidelines and ensuring compliance with civil rights laws will protect and empower communities. Maybe hosting workshops on legal rights would be beneficial?
>>Human Rights Activist: Alright, let's make sure we have a clear plan for collaborating with local artists. Forming committees sounds like a great idea, along with conducting regular surveys to ensure our methods respond to community feedback.

[Suddenly there's a brief interruption as someone's phone rings loudly.]

>>Political Scientist: Sorry about that! My ringtone always seems to go off at the worst times. Anyway—To summarize, um, we need clear metrics for evaluating the impact of creative methods in our outreach programs. These must be adaptable to each community's needs and responsive to feedback from local artists. Additionally, following civil rights laws will protect and empower communities.
>>Human Rights Activist: No worries! That ringtone gave me an idea—we could use mobile apps for real-time feedback from communities about our projects!"
