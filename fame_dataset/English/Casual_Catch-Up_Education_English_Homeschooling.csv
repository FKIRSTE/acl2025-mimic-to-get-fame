Homeschooling,"Homeschooling or home schooling (American English), also known as home education or elective home education (EHE) (British English),[1] is the education of school-aged children at home or a variety of places other than a school. Usually conducted by a parent, tutor, or online teacher, many homeschool families use less formal, more personalized and individualized methods of learning that are not always found in schools. The actual practice of homeschooling varies considerably. The spectrum ranges from highly structured forms based on traditional school lessons to more open, free forms such as unschooling, which is a lesson- and curriculum-free implementation of homeschooling. Some families who initially attended a school go through a deschooling process to decouple from school habits and prepare for homeschooling. While ""homeschooling"" is the term commonly used in North America, ""home education"" is primarily used in Europe and many Commonwealth countries. Homeschooling should not be confused with distance education, which generally refers to the arrangement where the student is educated by and conforms to the requirements of an online school rather than being educated independently and unrestrictedly by their parents or by themselves.

Before the introduction of compulsory school attendance laws, most childhood education was done by families and local communities. By the early 19th century, attending school became the most common means of education in the developed world. In the mid to late 20th century, more people began questioning the practice of school learning, which again led to an increase in the number of homeschoolers, especially in the Americas and some European countries. Homeschooling has become a common and legal alternative to public and private schools in many countries, largely due to the Internet, allowing quick access to information. The regulation and legality of homeschooling varies by jurisdiction.

There are many reasons for homeschooling, ranging from personal interests to dissatisfaction with the school system. Homeschooling is also an option for families living in remote rural areas, those temporarily abroad, those who travel frequently and therefore face the physical impossibility or difficulty of getting their children into school, and those who want to spend more time with their children. Health reasons and special needs can also explain why children cannot attend an outside-the-home school regularly and are at least partially homeschooled.

Critics of homeschooling argue that children may lack adequate socialization and, therefore, incompletely develop healthy social skills. Some are also concerned that parents may be unqualified to guide and advise their children or that abusive parents may use homeschooling to isolate their children. Critics also say that a child might not encounter people of other cultures, worldviews, and socioeconomic groups if not enrolled in a school. Therefore, these critics believe homeschooling cannot guarantee a comprehensive, neutral education without prescribed educational standards. Studies on homeschooled students typically rely on convenience sampling, which may disproportionately sample the highest-achieving homeschoolers.[2]: 51  Researchers have identified a need for more representative samples in studying homeschooling.[2]: 51 

While ""homeschooling"" is the term commonly used in the United States and other nations in North America, ""home education"" is primarily used in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe and many Commonwealth countries.[1][3][4]

For most of history, home-based education was common.[5] In many cultures, home education often consisted of literacy training centered around religious texts, as well as basic math skills needed in everyday life. In past Christian-majority cultures, reading aloud, reciting, and memorizing passages from the Christian Bible and other writings was central to this practice, as well as workplace-based education such as apprenticeships. Enlisting professional tutors was an option available only to the wealthy.[6]: 5–6  Home education declined in the 19th and 20th centuries with the enactment of compulsory school attendance laws. However, it continued to be practised in isolated communities. What is now known as homeschooling began in the 1960s and 1970s with educational reformists dissatisfied with industrialized education[definition needed].[5]

Home education and apprenticeship remained the main form of education until the 1830s.[7] However, in the 18th century, the majority of Europeans lacked formal education.[8] In the early 19th century, formal classroom schooling became the most common means of schooling throughout developed countries.[9] As laws enforcing public school attendance proliferated, movements to resist such laws began to form.[6]: 16–17 

Resistance to laws mandating school attendance emerged as early as the end of the nineteenth century.[2][6]: 16  Catholic groups in particular resisted the enforcement of Protestant ideals in public schools, as was observed in the 1844 Philadelphia nativist riots. Philadelphia's Roman Catholic bishop requested that Catholic schoolchildren be permitted to read the Catholic Douay bible in school rather than the Protestant King James Version, which was granted. This decision fanned anti-Catholic sentiment, sparking a rumor that Catholics were attempting to remove the Christian Bible from schools.[6]: 16  Toledo, Ohio, minister Patrick Francis Quigley was put on trial in 1891 for resisting the requirement to report the names of students at his school, which he was principal of; he argued unsuccessfully that ""the state has no right to control the education of the child.""[6]: 16  Resistance to mandatory schooling was sporadic throughout the 19th century as the state undertook more responsibility in protecting the rights of children.

In 1913, the US Bureau of Education established the Home Education Division, an organization that worked with the National Council of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations to provide home curriculum materials; these were meant to supplement, not substitute, for public schooling. In the early 20th century, the headmaster of Baltimore's Calvert School, Virgil Hillyer, recognized that various students at his school were unable to attend due to ill health and began to send out lesson plans to those students' parents. The Calvert method became a popular early home curriculum. Its advertising in periodicals such as McClure's admonished parents that the curriculum was necessary to provide a proper education.[6]: 26  This form of homeschooling was targeted primarily at those who needed to educate their children at home due to ill health, and many of their materials were dispatched to hospitals.[6]: 26  In 1940, remote education began to be delivered via telephone.[6]: 28 

In the 1960s, theonomist Rousas John Rushdoony began to advocate homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the increasingly secular nature of the public school system in the United States. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia, The Messianic Character of American Education, and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum. Rushdoony was frequently used as an expert witness by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in court cases. He often advocated the use of private schools.[10] The HSLDA, founded in 1983, was highly successful in influencing the legal status of homeschooling in the United States.[11] In the 1980s, homeschooling was illegal throughout much of the United States for parents who were not themselves trained educators. Today, the United States has some of the most lax laws around homeschooling, with most states requiring little to no oversight and no educational requirements for parents.[12]

Conservative Evangelical Christian parents were increasingly dissatisfied with the public school system and were the main demographic that organized to promote home education in the United States[when?].[13] Prominent right-wing evangelical pastor and activist Jerry Falwell sought to terminate sex education and discussions of evolutionary biology from American school curricula, instead recommending replacing both topics with prayer and Christian Bible study.[6]: 35  The movement embraced claims by Christian parents who advocated for homeschooling, such as Raymond and Dorothy Moore.[14] Another influential figure associated with the rise of the homeschooling movement was John Holt. Holt believed that informal education was better than compulsory education and expressed these views in his books How Children Fail and How Children Learn.[15] Holt advocated for unschooling, whereby children learn without any formalized curricula or expectations.[16] As homeschooling caught on in Evangelical Christian circles, the number of children being homeschooled increased massively, with some estimates suggesting the number went from under twenty thousand in the 1970s to nearly 500,000 by the end of the 1980s.[6]: 74 

Homeschooling is heavily restricted in Germany. The history of public schooling dates back to the time of Martin Luther, who called on the government to provide schooling to both boys and girls in To the Councilmen of all Cities in Germany (An die Ratsherren aller Städte deutschen Landes), so that they might read the Bible for themselves. Today, compulsory education at school is strictly enforced in Germany and is only permitted in rare cases, such as serious illness. However, parents interested in alternative schooling may send their children to a private, independent school.[17]

Homeschooling in France is permitted only in specific circumstances: for the child's health, for intensive artistic or sports training, for itinerant families, and for those who live too far from a school. To be granted the right to homeschool, parents must have a baccalauréat or equivalent to prove they are qualified to teach. These restrictions were introduced in September 2022, known as loi contre le séparatisme: a law designed to reduce ""Islamist separatism"" and enforce secularism.[18][19]

A meta-analysis of studies on homeschooling in Asia found that most homeschoolers cited religion as their reason for homeschooling.[20]

Because schools were widely shut down during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools implemented distance education and online learning. This is not considered homeschooling since public schools direct students' education.[2] However, the onset of the pandemic triggered a massive increase in the prevalence of homeschooling. An investigation by the Washington Post estimated that the United States saw a rise of homeschooled children from 1.5 million to between 1.9 and 2.7 million, a number comparable to the number of students in charter schools or Catholic schools. This increase was far-reaching across every measured demographic category and region. This increase has led to a rise in critical interest in the impacts of homeschooling, both positive and negative.[21]

In Texas homeschooling was already growing. According to Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey [22] in effort to explore the effect of COVID-19 on Texas families, the percent of families in Texas increased in 2020 going from 4.5% towards the end of the 2019-2020 school year to 12% at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year. As stated by the Texas Tribune, data collected by the Texas Homeschool Coalition revealed that about 30,000 students across the state of Texas were withdrawn from a charter or public school and made the transition to homeschool during the spring of 2021. Which is a growth of 40% in comparison to the past year. [23]

There are many reasons why parents and children choose to homeschool, whether by necessity or by choice.

Homeschool may be a necessity for a variety of reasons. For those who are in isolated rural locations that are too far from a conventional school, living abroad, or travel frequently, homeschool provides more consistency and convenience, eliminating the issues of distance or cultural barriers.[25] Many young athletes, actors, and musicians are taught at home to accommodate their travel and practice schedules more conveniently. Mental and physical health issues are also a reason parents may homeschool or take distance education.[26][27]

Parents commonly cite two main motivations for voluntarily homeschooling their children: dissatisfaction with the local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, the risk of school shootings, racism, and lack of faith in the school's ability to cater to their children's special needs.[28] Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or and moral position, and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning.[29]

A 2023 survey of homeschooling parents in the United States found concerns about school environment, moral instruction, dissatisfaction with academics, concern about school shootings, and bullying to be the most common reasons for homeschooling.[30] The need for distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic caused many parents to consider homeschooling where they might not have before.[31]

Concerns about school environment - the most commonly cited reason for homeschooling - may comprise a number of issues with conventional schooling, such as protection against bullying, social exclusion, drugs, stress, sexualization, social pressures, excessive performance thoughts,[clarification needed] social groups or role models with negative influences, and degrading treatment[clarification needed] in school.[32][33][34][35][36][26] Children may also learn more efficiently at home because they are not distracted by other students or typical school scheduling.[37] Some parents are of the opinion that certain temperaments are promoted in school, while others are inhibited which may also be a reason to homeschool their children.[38] Many parents also homeschool their children and return their child into the school system later on, for example because they think that their child is too young or not yet ready to start school.[29]

Some parents have objections to the secular nature of public schools and homeschool in order to give their children a religious education. Use of a religious curriculum such as Abeka is common among these families. In the United States, conservative Christians drove the movement to homeschool and made up the vast majority of homeschoolers until recent years. However, the percent of people who cited religion as the primary reason for homeschooling has declined drastically. In 2012, almost 2 of 3 homeschool parents did, while by 2023, the proportion dropped to just over 1 in 3.[30] In a survey of adults homeschooled in Christian households, over half of respondents characterized their family as fundamentalist, and over 80% reported being taught Young Earth creationism as part of their science education.[39] Homeschooling parents tend, in general, to lean more conservative than the general population.[30]

According to Texas Home School Coalition 21% of families in Texas chose to home school to insert religious or moral education[40]. The Texas Home School Coalition also interviewed several families that chose homeschooling, and the Kim Family stated that they chose to homeschool because they are a Christian family, and did not want their children to develop false world views[41].

In Asia, the majority of homeschoolers cited religion - Christianity, Confucianism, or Islam - as their primary reason for homeschooling.[20]

Some African-American families choose to homeschool as a way of increasing their children's understanding of African-American history – such as the Jim Crow laws that resulted in African Americans being prevented from reading and writing – and to limit the harm caused by the unintentional and sometimes subtle systemic racism that affects most American schools.[42] The increase of homeschooling post-COVID-19 pandemic saw the greatest increases among Black, Latino, and Asian American households. Many families cited concerns that their children, particularly boys, were perceived as threatening or violent at school due to racism, as well as the issue of school quality and funding.[43]

On the other hand, some groups promote homeschooling to enforce white supremacist ideals. An exposé of a Nazi homeschooling network in Ohio with over two thousand members led to no consequences or restrictions on the group due to lax regulatory requirements in the state.[44]

Homeschooling is usually conducted by a parent, tutor, or an online teacher,[45] but the concrete practice can vary widely. The spectrum ranges from highly structured forms based on traditional school lessons to more open, free forms like unschooling,[46] which is a curriculum-free implementation of homeschooling that involves teaching children based on their interests.[47][48][49]

Homeschool families can utilize a wide variety of educational methods and materials with a wide range of educational paradigms.[50] Some of the concepts homeschoolers can incorporate include classical education (including Trivium, Quadrivium), Charlotte Mason education, Montessori, theory of multiple intelligences, unschooling, Waldorf, school-at-home (curriculum choices from both secular and religious publishers), and A Thomas Jefferson Education. Homeschool educations may incorporate pre-made curriculum made up from private or small publishers, apprenticeship, hands-on-learning, distance learning (both online and correspondence), dual enrollment in local schools or colleges, and curriculum provided by local schools and many others. 

A student's education may be customized to support his or her learning level, style, and interests.[51] It is not uncommon for a student to experience more than one approach as the family discovers what works best for their student. Some companies offer all-in-one homeschooling curricula. Purchased as a grade-level package or separately by subject, the package may contain all of the needed books, materials, tests, answer keys, and extensive teacher guides.[52] However, many families use an eclectic approach, picking and choosing from various suppliers. For sources of curricula and books, a study found that 78 percent utilized ""a public library""; 77 percent used ""a homeschooling catalogue, publisher, or individual specialist""; 68 percent used ""retail bookstore or another store""; 60 percent used ""an education publisher that was not affiliated with homeschooling."" ""Approximately half"" used curriculum from ""a homeschooling organization"", 37 percent from a ""church, synagogue or other religious institution"" and 23 percent from ""their local public school or district."" In 2003, 41 percent utilized some sort of distance learning, approximately 20 percent by ""television, video or radio""; 19 percent via ""The Internet, e-mail, or the World Wide Web""; and 15 percent taking a ""correspondence course by mail designed specifically for homeschoolers.""[53][clarification needed]

Individual governmental units, e.g. states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements.[54]

Approaches to homeschooling fall under two categories: structured and unstructured. Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts to imitate the structure of a traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling, also known as unschooling, is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. This method attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.[55]

The term unschooling, coined by John Holt, describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but interact with the child following the child's interests, leaving them free to explore and learn.[56][53] Natural learning refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time ""teaching"", looking instead for ""learning moments"" throughout their daily activities. Parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the child's role as being responsible for asking and learning.[57]

Another prominent proponent of unschooling is John Taylor Gatto, author of Dumbing Us Down, The Exhausted School, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Weapons of Mass Instruction. Gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of ""state-controlled consciousness"" and serves as a prime illustration of the total institution — a social system which impels obedience to the state and quells free-thinking or dissent.[58]

Informal learning refers to the component of homeschooling which happens outside of the classroom. Informal learning is an everyday form of learning through participation and creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning. The term is usually used synonymously with ""non-formal learning"" and ""self-directed learning."" Informal learning differs from traditional learning as there are no expected objectives or outcomes. From the learner's standpoint, the knowledge that they receive is not intentional. Activities such as planting a garden, baking a cake or even talking to a technician at work about the installation of new software can be considered informal learning: the individual is completing a task with different intentions but ends up learning skills in the process.[59] Children watching their tomato plants grow will not generate questions about photosynthesis but they will learn that their plants are growing with water and sunlight. This leads them to have a base understanding of complex scientific concepts without any background studying.[60]

Depending on the part of the world, informal learning can take on many different identities and has differing cultural importances. Many ways of organizing homeschooling draw on the model of apprenticeships and play-based learning. In some South American indigenous cultures, such as the Chillihuani community in Peru, children learn irrigation and farming technique through play, advancing them not only in their own village and society but also in their knowledge of realistic techniques that they will need to survive.[61] In Western culture, children use informal learning in two main ways: through hands-on experience with new material, and by asking questions to someone who has more experience (i.e. parents, elders). The concept of informal learning depends on the inquisitiveness and interests of the child.[62]

In a unit study approach, multiple subjects such as math, science, history, art, and geography, are studied in relation to a single topic. Unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student. An extended form of unit studies, Integrated Thematic Instruction utilizes one central theme integrated throughout the curriculum so that students finish a school year with a deep understanding of a certain broad subject or idea.[63]

Autonomous learning is a school of education which sees learners as individuals who can and should be autonomous; i.e., be responsible for their own learning climate.

Autonomous education helps students develop their self-consciousness, vision, practicality, and freedom of discussion. These attributes serve to aid the student in his/her independent learning. However, a student must not start their autonomous learning completely on their own. It is said that first having interaction with someone who has more knowledge in a subject will speed up the student's learning and allow them to learn more independently.[64]

Some degree of autonomous learning is popular with those who home educate their children. In true autonomous learning, the child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or what interests to pursue. In-home education, this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.

Hybrid homeschooling or flex-school[29] is a form of homeschooling in which children split their time between homeschool and a more traditional schooling environment like a school.[65] The number of students who participated in hybrid homeschooling increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.[66]

A commonly cited reason for choosing this model is that parents are not sure whether they can provide their children a comprehensive and neutral education at home or cannot devote themselves to homeschooling full-time due to time constraints or excessive stress.[67] Some families also want their children to socialize with other children and find that schools are better suited for this purpose because social exchange does not only take place occasionally, but is an everyday experience there.[67]

A homeschool cooperative is a cooperative of families who homeschool their children. It provides an opportunity for children to learn from other parents who are more specialized in certain areas or subjects. Co-ops also provide social interaction. They may take lessons together or go on field trips. Some co-ops also offer events such as prom and graduation for homeschoolers.[68]

Homeschoolers are beginning to utilize Web 2.0 as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online. With social networks, homeschoolers can chat, discuss threads in forums, share information and tips, and even participate in online classes via learning management systems similar to those used by colleges.[citation needed]

Research on homeschooling faces a number of challenges and limitations. The documentation and regulation of homeschooling in the United States is highly variable among states, with a minority of states administering any rigorous testing or record-keeping of homeschooled children; in eleven states, no record of homeschooled students is kept at all.[69] As of 2022, virtually all research on homeschooling used convenience sampling, leading to issues with selection bias. Homeschoolers as a demographic tend towards distrust of surveillance and institutions, making eliminating survey bias a challenge.[69] Other common methodological problems commonly included the presence of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and parental involvement, over-reliance on parental testimony, and taking into account the timing and duration of homeschooling (many homeschoolers only do so for a few years).[2] Homeschooling research is often conducted on homeschooled children or their parents; surveys of adults who have been homeschooled are extremely limited.[69]

The majority of homeschool research in the United States is done with the support of the homeschool advocacy group, the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). A review of studies performed by prominent HSLDA-affiliated researcher Dr. Brian D. Ray found severe design limitations[69] and demographic bias; nearly all subjects in his studies were White, Christian, and from households with two married parents who were more educated than average. Meanwhile, a 2016 federal survey of US homeschoolers found that over 40 percent of homeschoolers were not White, a majority had parents with less than a bachelor's degree, and over one in five lived in poverty.[70]

In the UK, the government has noted that no figures are available on educational attainment for children educated at home: ""This means no assessment can be made of the impact on educational attainment of being home schooled"".[71]

Claims by homeschooling proponents that homeschoolers fare better than traditionally schooled children are insufficiently supported by data.[6]: 99 [69] With the studies available, a 2022 review found it was unable to offer firm conclusions because of these issues, but did not find systematic evidence of poor educational or social outcomes.[2] Another survey of studies related to homeschooling found that, controlling for demographic bias, homeschoolers were generally on par with non-homeschoolers, with a slight advantage in reading and writing, and a slight disadvantage in math.[69]

A study conducted by Ray in 2010 indicates that the higher the level of parents' income, the more likely the homeschooled child is able to achieve academic success, which is in alignment with the correlation between income and achievement for students at conventional schools.[72] In one study of families with parents who had an average of 13 years of schooling, homeschooling was correlated with lower test scores, which was attributed to the relatively lower educational status of the parents in the sample group; meanwhile, in studies with highly educated parents, homeschooling for longer periods of time, on average, had no effect, positive or negative.[69] A study which collected all homeschooling outcomes in Alaska (a state where homeschooling is extremely popular due to government financial incentives and support) found that low income students, students of color, and students with disabilities gained the most advantages when being homeschooled, while those from white, well-off families scored overall worse than their public school peers, and suffered the greatest disadvantage in math. This is notable as being the only study of homeschooling outcomes with a complete data set of all known homeschool children in a given population, which does not rely on volunteered information. However, the existence of a financial incentive to homeschool in Alaska does raise questions about the applicability of the results to other areas which do not have these programs in place.[73]

Unschooled children tend to score significantly below traditionally educated children, and higher parental involvement and the use of a structured curriculum is strongly positively correlated with homeschooling outcomes, as with conventionally schooled students.[74][69]

A survey of educational outcomes for homeschool students found that homeschoolers consistently scored below the average in math, but with mixed or average results in reading and writing. The exact cause of this is not known, but researchers speculated that this was due to the nature of curricula, which often consisted of being read to or self-directed reading, and a lack of parental training in math.[69][75] Homeschooled children have been found to be less self-motivated when studying math than reading or writing. This gap in competency has also been suggested as a reason why homeschoolers are less likely to pursue higher education.[75]

Looking beyond high school, a study by the 1990 National Home Education Research Institute (as cited by Wichers, 2001) found that at least 33% of homeschooled students attended a four-year college, and 17% attended a two-year college[76] (with the national average being 40% and 20%, respectively).[75] This same study examined the students after one year, finding that 17% pursued higher education.[76] A study by the Kentucky Office Of Education Accountability found that homeschooled students attended college or university within Kentucky at less than half the rate of other Kentucky high school graduates, with the academic outcomes of other homeschooled students being unknown.[77]

Although educational outcomes of homeschoolers are difficult to track, especially where homeschooled students are not required to be registered, home-schoolers tend to take standardized college admission tests such as the SAT at a disproportionately low rate, suggesting they may be underrepresented in higher education.[75]  Some homeschoolers averaged higher scores on college entrance tests in South Carolina.[78] Other scores (1999 data) showed mixed results, for example showing higher levels for homeschoolers in English (homeschooled 23.4 vs national average 20.5) and reading (homeschooled 24.4 vs national average 21.4) on the ACT, but mixed scores in math (homeschooled 20.4 vs national average 20.7 on the ACT as opposed to homeschooled 535 vs national average 511 on the 1999 SAT math).[79]

For those homeschoolers who do pursue higher education, their GPA tends to be higher.[75] Cogan (2010) found that homeschooled students at a doctoral program had higher high school GPAs (3.74) and transfer GPAs (3.65) than conventional students.[80] Snyder (2013) provided corroborating evidence that homeschoolers at a Catholic university were outperforming their peers in the areas of standardized tests and overall GPAs.[81] A limited amount of data exists that homeschoolers in college were much less likely than their peers to pursue degrees in STEM topics, and more likely to pursue creative degrees, which may be attributed to the ""math gap"" discussed above.[75]

There is some evidence from 2009 that home-educated children in the UK are more likely to be NEET, Not in Employment, Education or Training, at age 16 to 18.[71]

Due to its qualitative nature and reliance on parental or self-assessment, the social outcomes of homeschooling are challenging to determine, despite being a major criticism of homeschooling as a phenomenon, and the quality of existing studies on this topic is poor, due to subject-typical problems with demographic bias.[69]: 20 

Homeschooled children have been found to score higher than average in self-concept, a metric correlated to positive social outcomes.[82] NHERI researcher Richard G. Medlin found that homeschooled children sampled from Christian homeschool co-ops self-reported higher in cooperation, assertiveness, empathy, and self-control than a random sample of children attending public schools.[83] A study of the social connections of homeschooled children found that homeschoolers had an equal number of social connections as their peers, but that those connections had a larger range of ages.[69] A review of studies on the topic found that while homeschoolers were slightly more likely to report feelings of social isolation and be less peer-oriented, this may have fostered a greater sense of independence and self-determination as well.[69]

Homeschooled youth are less likely to use illicit substances and are more likely to disapprove of using alcohol and marijuana.[84]

Although a large proportion of parents cited religion as their primary reason for homeschooling, a 2008 survey found that homeschooling had no effect on the religious behavior or affiliation of children, with parents holding the same degree of influence over their children regardless of their schooling method.[69]

Homeschooled students are more likely to vote than average, and homeschooled families were found to be more politically involved than those who did not homeschool.[69]

Some studies suggest homeschooled children are less likely to experience sexual abuse than children in public schools, while others find no or mixed results.[85]

After the death by abuse of homeschooled autistic teen Matthew Tirado, a Connecticut study was done to investigate the prevalence of neglect and abuse among homeschooled families. It found that 38% of children withdrawn from school to be homeschooled lived in families with one or more reports of abuse or neglect to the Department of Children and Families.[86] In 1990, homeschool lobbyists defeated a proposed Florida law which would have required parents to be run against a child abuse registry before being allowed to homeschool their children.[87] In the United States, only two states, Pennsylvania and Arkansas, prevent convicted child abusers and sex offenders from homeschooling.  

Research on the long-term outcomes of homeschooled adults is severely lacking. An HSLDA survey, distributed by Evangelical Christian homeschooling networks, found extremely positive outcomes for homeschooled adults. A random survey of religious young adults found that those who were homeschooled got married younger, had fewer children, and divorced more frequently other religious adults, controlled for background variables. The homeschool cohort reported lower SAT scores, less time in college, and higher rates of feeling helplessness about life and lack of direction.[69] In a survey of homeschooled adults, the majority of respondents reported satisfaction with their homeschool experience, although some factors were strongly correlated with lower satisfaction in various areas. For instance, those who were offered fewer opportunities to socialize with peers reported significantly lower preparedness for adult life, and those who reported their parents as Christian fundamentalists reported higher rates of abuse and lower quality of academic instruction. The prevalence of mental health problems was roughly on par with the general populace.[88]

In Texas there are only three rules for homeschooling in Texas according to Texas Un-schoolers[89], the first rule is that the instruction must be bona fide or in other words ligate and not fake. The second rule is the instruction must be able to be visually seen through workbooks, or a video monitor. The third and final rule is that the curriculum must include the five primary subjects which are spelling, reading, grammar, mathematics, and good citizenship.

According to Texas Education Agency[90] homeschooling has been a legal option aside from public schools since 1994. In the case of Leeper et al. v. Arlington ISD et al.[91] the Supreme Court of Texas approved the decision of the lower court that children being educated at home are excused from the compulsory attendance requirement to the same length as those students that are registered in private schools.

Students that are home schooled are still able to earn their diploma and graduate. According to Texas Home School Coalition [92] parents are able to graduate their homeschool students, because homeschool falls under a private school in Texas therefore the administrant of a homeschool (the parents) have the authority to dictate the requirements needed to graduate, identical to private schools. Once the homeschooled student has finished the requirements from administrant, they can be graduated and granted a High School diploma.

Some organizations of teachers and school districts resist homeschooling. The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, has asserted that teachers should be licensed and that state-approved curricula should be used.[93][94] Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard University professor of law and faculty director of the Law School's Child Advocacy Program, recommended a ban on home education in 2019, calling it a risky practice.[95]

Gallup polls of American voters showed a significant change in attitude from 1985 to 2001, with respondents going from 73% opposed to homeschooling to 54% opposed.[96][97] In 1988, when asked whether parents should have a right to choose homeschooling, 53 percent thought that they should, as revealed by another poll.[98]

Elizabeth Bartholet stated that homeschooling reduces a child's exposure to mandated reporters such as teachers, making children more susceptible to sustained, unreported abuse, and recommended that homeschooling be presumptively banned.[95] While there is not enough data to determine exact rates of abuse in homeschooling there is, however, strong evidence to suggest that parents who engage in maltreatment and educational neglect are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.[99]

Political scientist Rob Reich speculated in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling could threaten to ""insulate students from exposure to diverse ideas and people.""[100][101]

Homeschooling involves educating children at home by parents or tutors using personalized methods. Historically common before compulsory schooling laws, it saw resurgence in the mid-20th century due to dissatisfaction with traditional education systems. Reasons for homeschooling include remote living situations, frequent travel, health issues, and dissatisfaction with local schools. Critics argue that homeschooling may limit socialization and expose children to unqualified teaching or isolation by abusive parents. The legality and regulation of homeschooling vary globally; some countries have strict requirements while others are more lenient. Studies show mixed academic outcomes for homeschooled students compared to their peers in conventional schools. Social outcomes are also varied, with some homeschoolers reporting higher self-concept but potential feelings of isolation. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased homeschooling rates as families sought alternatives to disrupted school systems.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants greet each other and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and smiles\n- Mention of the nice weather or recent events\n- Light-hearted comments to ease into the conversation"", ""Scene 2: Homeschooling Overview\nTLDR: Introduction to homeschooling topic with brief summary.\n- Definition of homeschooling\n- Historical context and resurgence in mid-20th century\n- Reasons for adoption (remote living, travel, health issues, dissatisfaction)"", ""Scene 3: Personal Experiences\nTLDR: Sharing personal stories and insights on homeschooling.\n- Homeschooling Advocate shares success stories\n- Homeschooling Parent discusses practical challenges and solutions\n- Online Educator talks about virtual education benefits"", ""Scene 4: Psychological Aspects\nTLDR: Discussion on child development and learning psychology.\n- Educational Psychologist presents research findings on academic outcomes\n- Sociologist shares observations on social impacts and self-concept"", ""Scene 5: Policy and Regulation\nTLDR: Examination of legal aspects and global variations in homeschooling regulations.\n- Education Policy Expert explains regulatory requirements in different countries\n- Debate on strict vs. lenient regulations"", ""Scene 6: Open Discussion & Spontaneous Contributions\nTLDR: Free-flowing conversation allowing participants to bring up unplanned topics.\n- Encouragement for spontaneous thoughts or questions from all participants\n- Sharing personal anecdotes related to homeschooling experiences"", ""Scene 7: Off-topic Moments & Personal Insights\nTLDR: Brief diversion into non-work-related topics to build rapport.\n- Casual chat about hobbies or recent activities outside work\n- Sharing funny or interesting personal stories"", ""Scene 8: Wrap-Up & Future Plans\nTLDR: Concluding remarks with focus on future catch-ups and ongoing discussions.\n- Summary of key points discussed during the meeting\n- Suggestions for future topics or follow-up meetings""]",">>Homeschooling Advocate: Hey everyone! How's it going? Did anyone catch the weather today? It's absolutely gorgeous outside!
>>Educational Psychologist: Hi all! It's great to see you. The nice weather today really puts me in a good mood.
>>Education Policy Expert: Absolutely! I feel like the good weather makes everyone happier. Anyway, let's dive into our main topic for today.
>>Homeschooling Parent: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks. Speaking of the nice weather, it's perfect for some outdoor activities with the kids. I wanted to discuss some new ideas for incorporating outdoor learning into our curriculum.
>>Sociologist: Hi everyone! Great to see you all. Outdoor learning sounds like a fantastic idea. It can really help engage students in a different way.
>>Online Educator: Hey folks! Good to see you all. Yeah, outdoor learning could be very beneficial. Let's brainstorm some ways we can integrate it effectively. 
 >>Homeschooling Advocate: You know, homeschooling has a rich history that dates back to before compulsory school attendance laws. In my experience, many families choose homeschooling due to remote living or frequent travel, which makes traditional schooling challenging.
>>Educational Psychologist: That's a good point! Additionally, research shows that homeschooling can be particularly beneficial for children with health issues or special needs. It allows for a more flexible and accommodating learning environment. This flexibility can significantly enhance their cognitive and emotional development.
>>Education Policy Expert: I agree with both of you. The law states that homeschooling is a legal alternative to public and private schooling, especially for families facing unique circumstances like remote living or frequent travel. Regulations require parents to adhere to specific educational standards to ensure their children receive a comprehensive education.
>>Homeschooling Parent: For example, my family travels for work every few months, and homeschooling has allowed us to maintain a consistent education schedule despite our frequent moves.
>>Sociologist: From my research, homeschooling has seen a resurgence since the mid-20th century due to various factors. Families living in remote areas or those who travel often find traditional schooling impractical. Health issues and dissatisfaction with local schools also play significant roles in the decision to homeschool.
>>Online Educator: I think virtual education can be an excellent solution for families who travel frequently or live in remote areas. It provides the flexibility and consistency needed to ensure children receive quality education regardless of their location.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: As I mentioned earlier about homeschooling's history, it's also important to note how modern technology has made it even more accessible. Online resources have really expanded what we can offer our kids at home.
>>Educational Psychologist: Absolutely! Studies indicate that homeschooling can provide a developmentally appropriate environment for children with health issues or special needs. The individualized attention often found in these settings can significantly enhance cognitive and emotional growth.
>>Education Policy Expert: Indeed! Homeschooling regulations require parents to adhere to specific educational standards ensuring comprehensive education despite unique circumstances like remote living or frequent travel. 
 >>Homeschooling Advocate: Homeschooling offers a unique opportunity to tailor education to each child's needs. In my experience, every child is unique and can thrive when given the right environment and resources.
>>Homeschooling Parent: One of the biggest challenges in homeschooling is balancing structure with flexibility. You know, every child learns differently, and sometimes it's hard to find the right approach that keeps them engaged without overwhelming them.
>>Online Educator: Virtual education opens doors for homeschooling families by providing access to a wide range of resources and interactive learning opportunities. It can really help in maintaining that balance between structure and flexibility.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: That's great! Homeschooling lets you focus on what your child is good at and interested in. You can really see their strengths and interests blossom.
>>Educational Psychologist: Studies have found that homeschooling really helps kids grow both mentally and emotionally. They benefit from individualized attention which helps them understand and retain material better. But it's important to make sure the learning approach suits their developmental stage so they don't get overwhelmed.
>>Education Policy Expert: The law requires homeschooling to meet certain educational standards, including core subjects like reading, math, and citizenship. This ensures that while homeschooling offers flexibility, it also maintains a structured approach for comprehensive education.
>>Sociologist: Homeschooling can sometimes limit children's social interactions compared to traditional schools. How do you all address this concern?
>>Homeschooling Parent: We join local homeschooling groups or co-ops where kids can interact with peers and participate in group activities.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: I agree! Incorporating community activities like local clubs or sports teams has been great for my kids' social skills development.
>>Educational Psychologist: Absolutely! Structured social interactions through community activities are beneficial for children’s overall development.
>>Sociologist: While homeschooling offers tailored educational experiences, it often lacks diverse social interactions found in traditional schools. How do you ensure your children are exposed to different perspectives?
>>Homeschooling Parent: We participate in local community events or online cultural exchange programs. It's amazing how much they learn from interacting with people from different backgrounds. 
 >>Educational Psychologist: I've found that kids who join community events or cultural programs often develop better cognitive and emotional skills. These experiences are crucial for fostering a well-rounded self-concept.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: Homeschooling can definitely offer diverse social interactions through community events and cultural exchange programs. In my experience, these activities have been amazing for my kids. They get to meet people from different backgrounds and learn so much outside the traditional classroom setting.
>>Homeschooling Parent: Homeschooling really allows for a tailored approach to each child's learning style. Every child learns differently, and being able to adapt the curriculum to fit their needs can be incredibly beneficial. Plus, participating in community events helps them develop social skills naturally.
>>Sociologist: I've noticed that homeschooling sometimes limits kids' exposure to different social interactions. While community events and cultural exchange programs are beneficial—
>>Homeschooling Advocate (interrupts): Sorry to jump in here, but don't you think it depends on how proactive the parents are? If they actively seek out these opportunities...
>>Sociologist: Yes, that's a good point. Proactive parents can enhance their children's social experiences through these activities, but they might not fully replicate everyday social interactions found in traditional schools.
>>Education Policy Expert: Homeschooling has to meet certain educational standards to ensure comprehensive development. Community events and cultural exchange programs are great but can't fully substitute regular peer interactions found in traditional school settings.
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>Online Educator (laughs): Looks like someone forgot to silence their phone! Happens to me all the time.
>>(Everyone chuckles briefly)
>>Educational Psychologist (smiling): As I was saying—these interactions play a critical role in developing social skills and emotional intelligence. 
 >>Education Policy Expert: Homeschooling regulations vary significantly across different countries. For instance, Germany enforces strict compulsory school attendance laws, allowing homeschooling only in rare cases like severe illness. Conversely, the United States has relatively lenient regulations with minimal oversight in many states. These differences impact how parents can structure their homeschooling curriculum and ensure compliance.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: The flexibility in homeschooling regulations, like those in the United States, allows parents to tailor education to their child's unique needs. In my experience, this can lead to a more personalized and effective learning journey. For example, my daughter excels in math but struggles with reading; homeschooling lets us focus more on her reading skills while still advancing her math knowledge.
>>Educational Psychologist: That's a great point about personalization. Research shows that how well homeschooling fits with kids' growth stages can vary greatly depending on the regulatory framework in place. In countries with strict regulations like Germany, children may benefit from a structured approach that ensures comprehensive educational standards are met. On the other hand, lenient regulations like those in the United States allow for greater flexibility but require parents to be more vigilant about maintaining educational quality.
>>Homeschooling Parent: Absolutely! My son struggled with traditional school schedules due to his ADHD, but homeschooling allows us to create a routine that works for him. However, it also means we have to be really diligent about ensuring he's meeting educational standards and not falling behind.
>>Sociologist: I see where you're coming from. Strict regulations can sometimes stifle the flexibility that homeschooling offers. Society shapes us in ways that aren't always conducive to rigid structures. It's interesting how different countries balance these dynamics—sometimes too much structure can hinder social development.
>>Online Educator: Given these challenges with varying regulations, virtual education offers an interesting middle ground by providing a structured curriculum while allowing for flexibility in delivery. This balance helps parents ensure their children meet educational standards without sacrificing personalized learning.
>>Education Policy Expert: While lenient regulations offer flexibility, they also necessitate a higher degree of parental vigilance to ensure educational standards are met. Parents must not only tailor the curriculum but also maintain comprehensive records and assessments to demonstrate compliance. This balance between freedom and accountability is crucial for effective homeschooling.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: Exactly! And it's not just about academic performance; it's also about fostering creativity and independent thinking which might be harder under strict guidelines.
>>Educational Psychologist: Studies indicate that developmental outcomes of homeschooling are significantly influenced by regulatory environments. Children in countries with stringent regulations often exhibit higher academic performance due to structured curricula and consistent oversight. However, lenient regulations may foster creativity and independent learning but require parents to be vigilant about maintaining educational standards. 
 >>Homeschooling Parent: You know, finding a balance between structure and flexibility is crucial. I've found that incorporating hands-on activities like cooking or gardening can really help maintain engagement and creativity while still covering academic concepts.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: Absolutely! One of the most amazing aspects of homeschooling is the ability to tailor learning experiences to each child's unique needs. For instance, my son struggled with traditional math lessons, but when we started using cooking as a way to teach fractions and measurements, it clicked for him. It's incredible how practical activities can make abstract concepts more tangible.
>>Educational Psychologist: That's interesting about using cooking for math—I've seen similar benefits in my research. Studies show that practical activities like cooking really help kids learn better because they engage different learning styles and foster critical thinking.
>>Education Policy Expert: Well, it's important to remember that homeschooling must adhere to specific educational standards to ensure a comprehensive education. Parents need to cover core subjects like math, reading, and science to make sure homeschooled children receive an education comparable to their peers in traditional schools.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: I believe homeschooling allows for such a unique and personalized approach to learning. For example, my daughter loves animals, so we incorporated biology lessons into our visits to the local zoo. Her passion for animals made her more engaged in learning about ecosystems and animal behavior.
>>Sociologist: From my research, I've observed that homeschooling can significantly impact family dynamics. It often strengthens the bond between parents and children because of the increased time spent together. But it can also create stress if not managed well.
>>Online Educator: In my experience, virtual education can be a fantastic tool for homeschooling families. It offers flexibility and access to a wide range of resources that can complement hands-on activities like cooking or gardening.
>>Homeschooling Parent: I agree with what you said about virtual education complementing hands-on activities—it’s been really helpful for us too. We use online resources alongside our everyday tasks like cooking together, which makes learning both fun and effective.
>>Educational Psychologist: And these kinds of activities are particularly beneficial for children with special needs. They provide sensory experiences and practical applications that support cognitive and emotional growth.
>>Sociologist: Homeschooling does lead to unique social dynamics within families; it often strengthens bonds due to increased time together but can also create stress if not managed well.
>>Online Educator: Virtual education opens doors for homeschooling families by providing access to diverse resources and interactive learning opportunities. Technology complements hands-on activities beautifully. 
 >>Homeschooling Parent: Oh, speaking of technology, I recently tried out a new app that helps kids learn coding through fun games. My son is absolutely hooked! It's amazing how quickly he's picking up the concepts.
>>Homeschooling Advocate: That sounds fantastic! You know, I've been painting again lately. It's so therapeutic and a great way to unwind after a busy day.
>>Homeschooling Parent: Oh really? What kind of painting do you do?
>>Homeschooling Advocate: Mostly landscapes. Anyone else picked up any new hobbies?
>>Educational Psychologist: Actually, hobbies like painting or coding are great for kids' development. They get to relax while also boosting creativity and problem-solving skills.
>>Homeschooling Parent: That's interesting! I've started baking bread at home. It's such a fun activity, plus the kids love helping out. There's something really satisfying about making food from scratch.
>>Sociologist: Yeah, hobbies can really bring families together. Hiking with my kids has been such a bonding experience.
>>Online Educator: Hiking sounds wonderful! I've been getting into photography lately—it's so rewarding capturing moments. Plus, my students love seeing the photos I take!
>>Homeschooling Advocate: Photography is great! I've taken up birdwatching recently—it's relaxing to sit quietly and observe different species. It’s also a fantastic way to get the kids interested in nature!
>>Educational Psychologist: Well, research shows that hobbies like birdwatching can enhance observational skills and patience in children. It's fascinating how these activities contribute to their overall development.
>>Homeschooling Parent: Speaking of nature, we've been gardening together as a family project. The kids love planting seeds and watching them grow—it’s educational and fun!
>>Sociologist: Gardening is such a wonderful activity for families! It teaches responsibility and patience while providing an opportunity for everyone to work together towards a common goal. 
 >>Education Policy Expert: Well, as we wrap up, let's summarize our key points: the benefits of homeschooling, challenges in balancing structure and flexibility, and the importance of adhering to educational standards. Moving forward, I suggest we focus on exploring more about virtual education tools and their integration into homeschooling. Shall we schedule a follow-up meeting to delve deeper into these topics?

>>Homeschooling Advocate: Absolutely! Diving into virtual education tools would be really beneficial—it could help us understand how to better support our kids' learning experiences at home. Maybe we can also discuss some new hobbies or activities that have educational value?

>>Educational Psychologist: That's a great idea; we should explore their impact on child development further too. What specific tools do you think we should start with?

>>Sociologist: Exploring virtual education tools will give us insights into how technology can enhance homeschooling practices. Plus, talking about hobbies that promote family bonding and social skills would be valuable. How do you think these hobbies can be integrated into daily routines?

>>Online Educator: Yeah, for sure! Virtual education is my area of expertise, so I'd love to share some effective strategies and tools I've used with homeschooling families. By the way, has anyone tried using coding games? They're quite engaging!

>>Homeschooling Parent: Sounds good to me! Um, I'm always looking for new ways to make learning enjoyable for my kids. Coding games sound interesting—my son loves video games.

>>Education Policy Expert: Great! I'll send out an email later today so we can find a time that works for everyone to catch up again soon."
