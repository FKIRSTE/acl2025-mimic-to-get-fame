Cosplay,"

Cosplay, a blend word of ""costume play"", is an activity and performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character.[1] Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term ""cosplay"" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga, television series, rock music performances, video games,  memes and in some cases, original characters.  The term has been adopted as slang, often in politics, to mean someone pretending to play a role or take on a personality disingenuously.

Cosplay grew out of the practice of fan costuming at science fiction conventions, beginning with Morojo's ""futuristicostumes"" created for the 1st World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939.[2] The Japanese term ""cosplay"" (コスプレ, kosupure) was coined in 1984. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very popular among all genders, and it is not unusual to see crossplay, also referred to as gender-bending.

The term ""cosplay"" is a Japanese blend word of the English terms costume and play.[1] The term was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi [ja] of Studio Hard[3] in an article for the Japanese magazine My Anime [ja] in June 1983.[3] Takahashi decided to coin a new word rather than use the existing translation of the English term ""masquerade"" because it implied nobility and was old-fashioned.[4][5] The coinage reflects a common Japanese method of abbreviation in which the first two moras of a pair of words are used to form an independent compound: 'costume' becomes kosu (コス) and 'play' becomes pure (プレ).

Masquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. They were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance, generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, which were particularly popular in Venice.

In April 1877, Jules Verne sent out almost 700 invitations for an elaborate costume ball, where several of the guests showed up dressed as characters from Verne's novels.[6]

Costume parties (American English) or fancy dress parties (British English) were popular from the 19th century onwards. Costuming guides of the period, such as Samuel Miller's Male Character Costumes (1884)[7] or Ardern Holt's Fancy Dresses Described (1887),[8] feature mostly generic costumes, whether that be period costumes, national costumes, objects or abstract concepts such as ""Autumn"" or ""Night"". Most specific costumes described therein are for historical figures although some are sourced from fiction, like The Three Musketeers or Shakespeare characters.

By March 1891, a literal call by one Herbert Tibbits for what would today be described as ""cosplayers"" was advertised for an event held from 5–10 March that year at the Royal Albert Hall in London, for the so-named Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete based on a science fiction novel and its characters, published two decades earlier.[9]

A.D. Condo's science fiction comic strip character Mr. Skygack, from Mars (a Martian ethnographer who comically misunderstands many Earthly affairs) is arguably the first fictional character that people emulated by wearing costumes, as in 1908 Mr. and Mrs. William Fell of Cincinnati, Ohio, are reported to have attended a masquerade at a skating rink wearing Mr. Skygack and Miss Dillpickles costumes. Later, in 1910, an unnamed woman won first prize at masquerade ball in Tacoma, Washington, wearing another Skygack costume.[13][14]

The first people to wear costumes to attend a convention were science fiction fans Forrest J Ackerman and Myrtle R. Douglas, known in fandom as Morojo. They attended the 1939 1st World Science Fiction Convention (Nycon or 1st Worldcon) in the Caravan Hall, New York, US dressed in ""futuristicostumes"", including green cape and breeches, based on the pulp magazine artwork of Frank R. Paul and the 1936 film Things to Come, designed and created by Douglas.[14][15][16]

Ackerman later stated that he thought everyone was supposed to wear a costume at a science fiction convention, although only he and Douglas did.[17]

Fan costuming caught on, however, and the 2nd Worldcon (1940) had both an unofficial masquerade held in Douglas' room and an official masquerade as part of the programme.[18][19][20] David Kyle won the masquerade wearing a Ming the Merciless costume created by Leslie Perri, while Robert A. W. Lowndes received second place with a Bar Senestro costume (from the novel The Blind Spot by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint).[19] Other costumed attendees included guest of honor E. E. Smith as Northwest Smith (from C. L. Moore's series of short stories) and both Ackerman and Douglas wearing their futuristicostumes again.[17][19][21] Masquerades and costume balls continued to be part of World Science Fiction Convention tradition thereafter.[20] Early Worldcon masquerade balls featured a band, dancing, food and drinks. Contestants either walked across a stage or a cleared area of the dance floor.[20]

Ackerman wore a ""Hunchbackerman of Notre Dame"" costume to the 3rd Worldcon (1941), which included a mask designed and created by Ray Harryhausen, but soon stopped wearing costumes to conventions.[17] Douglas wore an Akka costume (from A. Merritt's novel The Moon Pool), the mask again made by Harryhausen, to the 3rd Worldcon and a Snake Mother costume (another Merritt costume, from The Snake Mother) to the 4th Worldcon (1946).[22] Terminology was yet unsettled; the 1944 edition of Jack Speer's Fancyclopedia used the term costume party.[23]

Rules governing costumes became established in response to specific costumes and costuming trends.  The first nude contestant at a Worldcon masquerade was in 1952; but the height of this trend was in the 1970s and early 1980s, with a few every year.[20]  This eventually led to ""No Costume is No Costume"" rule, which banned full nudity, although partial nudity was still allowed as long as it was a legitimate representation of the character.[14] Mike Resnick describes the best of the nude costumes as Kris Lundi wearing a harpy costume to the 32nd Worldcon (1974) (she received an honorable mention in the competition).[20][24][25] Another costume that instigated a rule change was an attendee at the 20th Worldcon (1962) whose blaster prop fired a jet of real flame; which led to fire being banned.[20]  At the 30th WorldCon (1972), artist Scott Shaw wore a costume composed largely of peanut butter to represent his own underground comix character called ""The Turd"".  The peanut butter rubbed off, doing damage to soft furnishings and other peoples' costumes, and then began to go rancid under the heat of the lighting.  Food, odious, and messy substances were banned as costume elements after that event.[20][26][27][28]

Costuming spread with the science fiction conventions and the interaction of fandom.  The earliest known instance of costuming at a convention in the United Kingdom was at the London Science Fiction Convention (1953) but this was only as part of a play.  However, members of the Liverpool Science Fantasy Society attended the 1st Cytricon (1955), in Kettering, wearing costumes and continued to do so in subsequent years.[29] The 15th Worldcon (1957) brought the first official convention masquerade to the UK.[29] The 1960 Eastercon in London may have been the first British-based convention to hold an official fancy dress party as part of its programme.[30]
The joint winners were Ethel Lindsay and Ina Shorrock as two of the titular witches from the novel The Witches of Karres by James H. Schmitz.[31]

Star Trek conventions began in 1969 and major conventions began in 1972 and they have featured cosplay throughout.[32]

In Japan, costuming at conventions was a fan activity from at least the 1970s, especially after the launch of the Comiket convention in December 1975.[14]  Costuming at this time was known as kasō (仮装).[14]  The first documented case of costuming at a fan event in Japan was at Ashinocon (1978), in Hakone, at which future science fiction critic Mari Kotani wore a costume based on the cover art for Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel A Fighting Man of Mars.[Notes 1][33][34] In an interview Kotani states that there were about twenty costumed attendees at the convention's costume party—made up of members of her Triton of the Sea fan club and Kansai Entertainers (関西芸人, Kansai Geinin), antecedent of the Gainax anime studio—with most attendees in ordinary clothing.[33]  One of the Kansai group, an unnamed friend of Yasuhiro Takeda, wore an impromptu Tusken Raider costume (from the film Star Wars) made from one of the host-hotel's rolls of toilet paper.[35] Costume contests became a permanent part of the Nihon SF Taikai conventions from Tokon VII in 1980.

Possibly the first costume contest held at a comic book convention was at the 1st Academy Con held at Broadway Central Hotel in New York in August 1965.[36] Roy Thomas, future editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics but then just transitioning from a fanzine editor to a professional comic book writer, attended in a Plastic Man costume.[36]

The first Masquerade Ball held at San Diego Comic-Con was in 1974 during the convention's 6th event.  Voice actress June Foray was the master of ceremonies.[37]  Future scream queen Brinke Stevens won first place wearing a Vampirella costume.[38][39] Ackerman (who was the creator of Vampirella) was in attendance and posed with Stevens for photographs.  They became friends and, according to Stevens ""Forry and his wife, Wendayne, soon became like my god parents.""[40]  Photographer Dan Golden saw a photograph of Stevens in the Vampirella costume while visiting Ackerman's house, leading to him hiring her for a non-speaking role in her first student film, Zyzak is King (1980), and later photographing her for the cover of the first issue of Femme Fatales (1992).[40]  Stevens attributes these events to launching her acting career.[40]

As early as a year after the 1975 release of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, audience members began dressing as characters from the movie and role-playing (although the initial incentive for dressing-up was free admission) in often highly accurate costumes.[41][42]

Costume-Con, a conference dedicated to costuming, was first held in January 1983.[43][44] The International Costumers Guild, Inc., originally known as the Greater Columbia Fantasy Costumer's Guild, was launched after the 3rd Costume-Con (1985) as a parent organization and to support costuming.[43]

Costuming had been a fan activity in Japan from the 1970s, and it became much more popular in the wake of Takahashi's report.  The new term did not catch on immediately, however.  It was a year or two after the article was published before it was in common use among fans at conventions.[14]  It was in the 1990s, after exposure on television and in magazines, that the term and practice of cosplaying became common knowledge in Japan.[14]

The first cosplay cafés appeared in the Akihabara area of Tokyo in the late 1990s.[18][45]  A temporary maid café was set up at the Tokyo Character Collection event in August 1998 to promote the video game Welcome to Pia Carrot 2 (1997).[45]  An occasional Pia Carrot Restaurant was held at the shop Gamers in Akihabara in the years up to 2000.[45]  Being linked to specific intellectual properties limited the lifespan of these cafés, which was solved by using generic maids, leading to the first permanent establishment, Cure Maid Café, which opened in March 2001.[45]

The first World Cosplay Summit was held on 12 October 2003 at the Rose Court Hotel in Nagoya, Japan, with five cosplayers invited from Germany, France and Italy.  There was no contest until 2005, when the World Cosplay Championship began.  The first winners were the Italian team of Giorgia Vecchini [it], Francesca Dani and Emilia Fata Livia.

Worldcon masquerade attendance peaked in the 1980s and started to fall thereafter.  This trend was reversed when the concept of cosplay was re-imported from Japan.


Cosplay costumes vary greatly and can range from simple themed clothing to highly detailed costumes. It is generally considered different from Halloween and Mardi Gras costume wear, as the intention is to replicate a specific character, rather than to reflect the culture and symbolism of a holiday event. As such, when in costume, some cosplayers often seek to adopt the affect, mannerisms, and body language of the characters they portray (with ""out of character"" breaks). The characters chosen to be cosplayed may be sourced from any movie, TV series, book, comic book, video game, music band, anime, or manga. Some cosplayers even choose to cosplay an original character of their own design or a fusion of different genres (e.g., a steampunk version of a character), and it is a part of the ethos of cosplay that anybody can be anything, as with genderbending, crossplay, or drag, a cosplayer playing a character of another ethnicity, or a hijabi portraying Captain America.[46][47] 
Cosplayers obtain their apparel through many different methods. Manufacturers produce and sell packaged outfits for use in cosplay, with varying levels of quality. These costumes are often sold online, but also can be purchased from dealers at conventions. Japanese manufacturers of cosplay costumes reported a profit of 35 billion yen in 2008.[48] A number of individuals also work on commission, creating custom costumes, props, or wigs designed and fitted to the individual. Other cosplayers, who prefer to create their own costumes, still provide a market for individual elements, and various raw materials, such as unstyled wigs, hair dye, cloth and sewing notions, liquid latex, body paint, costume jewelry, and prop weapons.

Cosplay represents an act of embodiment. Cosplay has been closely linked to the presentation of self,[49] yet cosplayers' ability to perform is limited by their physical features. The accuracy of a cosplay is judged based on the ability to accurately represent a character through the body, and individual cosplayers frequently are faced by their own ""bodily limits""[50] such as level of attractiveness, body size, and disability[51] that often restrict and confine how accurate the cosplay is perceived to be. Authenticity is measured by a cosplayer's individual ability to translate on-screen manifestation to the cosplay itself. Some have argued that cosplay can never be a true representation of the character; instead, it can only be read through the body, and that true embodiment of a character is judged based on nearness to the original character form.[52] Cosplaying can also help some of those with self-esteem problems.[53][54]

Many cosplayers create their own outfits, referencing images of the characters in the process. In the creation of the outfits, much time is given to detail and qualities, thus the skill of a cosplayer may be measured by how difficult the details of the outfit are and how well they have been replicated. Because of the difficulty of replicating some details and materials, cosplayers often educate themselves in crafting specialties such as textiles, sculpture, face paint, fiberglass, fashion design, woodworking, and other uses of materials in the effort to render the look and texture of a costume accurately.[55] Cosplayers often wear wigs in conjunction with their outfit to further improve the resemblance to the character. This is especially necessary for anime and manga or video-game characters who often have unnaturally colored and uniquely styled hair. Simpler outfits may be compensated for their lack of complexity by paying attention to material choice and overall high quality.

To look more like the characters they are portraying, cosplayers might also engage in various forms of body modification. Cosplayers may opt to change their skin color utilizing make-up to more simulate the race of the character they are adopting.[56] Contact lenses that match the color of their character's eyes are a common form of this, especially in the case of characters with particularly unique eyes as part of their trademark look. Contact lenses that make the pupil look enlarged to visually echo the large eyes of anime and manga characters are also used.[57] Another form of body modification in which cosplayers engage is to copy any tattoos or special markings their character might have. Temporary tattoos, permanent marker, body paint, and in rare cases, permanent tattoos, are all methods used by cosplayers to achieve the desired look. Permanent and temporary hair dye, spray-in hair coloring, and specialized extreme styling products are all used by some cosplayers whose natural hair can achieve the desired hairstyle. It is also commonplace for them to shave off their eyebrows to gain a more accurate look.

Some anime and video game characters have weapons or other accessories that are hard to replicate, and conventions have strict rules regarding those weapons, but most cosplayers engage in some combination of methods to obtain all the items necessary for their costumes; for example, they may commission a prop weapon, sew their own clothing, buy character jewelry from a cosplay accessory manufacturer, or buy a pair of off-the-rack shoes, and modify them to match the desired look.

Cosplay may be presented in a number of ways and places. A subset of cosplay culture is centered on sex appeal, with cosplayers specifically choosing characters known for their attractiveness or revealing costumes. However, wearing a revealing costume can be a sensitive issue while appearing in public.[58][59][60] People appearing naked at American science fiction fandom conventions during the 1970s were so common, a ""no costume is no costume"" rule was introduced.[61] Some conventions throughout the United States, such as Phoenix Comicon[62] (now known as Phoenix Fan Fusion) and Penny Arcade Expo,[63] have also issued rules upon which they reserve the right to ask attendees to leave or change their costumes if deemed to be inappropriate to a family-friendly environment or something of a similar nature.

The most popular form of presenting a cosplay publicly is by wearing it to a fan convention. Multiple conventions dedicated to anime and manga, comics, TV shows, video games, science fiction, and fantasy may be found all around the world. Cosplay-centered conventions include Cosplay Mania in the Philippines and EOY Cosplay Festival in Singapore.

The single largest event featuring cosplay is the semiannual doujinshi market, Comic Market (Comiket), held in Japan during summer and winter. Comiket attracts hundreds of thousands of manga and anime fans, where thousands of cosplayers congregate on the roof of the exhibition center. In North America, the highest-attended fan conventions featuring cosplayers are San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic Con held in the United States, and the anime-specific Anime North in Toronto, Otakon held in Washington, D.C. and Anime Expo held in Los Angeles. Europe's largest event is Japan Expo held in Paris, while the London MCM Expo and the London Super Comic Convention are the most notable in the UK. Supanova Pop Culture Expo is Australia's biggest event.

Star Trek conventions have featured cosplay for many decades. These include Destination Star Trek, a UK convention, and Star Trek Las Vegas, a US convention.

In different comic fairs, ""Thematic Areas"" are set up where cosplayers can take photos in an environment that follows that of the game or animation product from which they are taken. Sometimes the cosplayers are part of the area, playing the role of staff with the task of entertaining the other visitors. Some examples are the thematic areas dedicated to Star Wars or to Fallout. The areas are set up by not for profit associations of fans, but in some major fairs it is possible to visit areas set up directly by the developers of the video games or the producers of the anime.

The appearance of cosplayers at public events makes them a popular draw for photographers.[64] As this became apparent in the late 1980s, a new variant of cosplay developed in which cosplayers attended events mainly for the purpose of modeling their characters for still photography rather than engaging in continuous role play. Rules of etiquette were developed to minimize awkward situations involving boundaries. Cosplayers pose for photographers and photographers do not press them for personal contact information or private sessions, follow them out of the area, or take photos without permission. The rules allow the collaborative relationship between photographers and cosplayers to continue with the least inconvenience to each other.[34]

Some cosplayers choose to have a professional photographer take high quality images of them in their costumes posing as the character. Cosplayers and photographers frequently exhibit their work online and sometimes sell their images.[64]

As the popularity of cosplay has grown, many conventions have come to feature a contest surrounding cosplay that may be the main feature of the convention. Contestants present their cosplay, and often to be judged for an award, the cosplay must be self-made. The contestants may choose to perform a skit, which may consist of a short performed script or dance with optional accompanying audio, video, or images shown on a screen overhead. Other contestants may simply choose to pose as their characters. Often, contestants are briefly interviewed on stage by a master of ceremonies. The audience is given a chance to take photos of the cosplayers. Cosplayers may compete solo or in a group. Awards are presented, and these awards may vary greatly. Generally, a best cosplayer award, a best group award, and runner-up prizes are given. Awards may also go to the best skit and a number of cosplay skill subcategories, such as master tailor, master weapon-maker, master armorer, and so forth.

The most well-known cosplay contest event is the World Cosplay Summit, selecting cosplayers from 40 countries to compete in the final round in Nagoya, Japan. Some other international events include European Cosplay Gathering (finals taking place at Japan Expo in Paris),[65] EuroCosplay (finals taking place at London MCM Comic Con),[66] and the Nordic Cosplay Championship (finals taking place at NärCon in Linköping, Sweden).[67]

This table contains a list of the most common cosplay competition judging criteria, as seen from World Cosplay Summit,[68] Cyprus Comic Con,[69] and ReplayFX.[70]

Portraying a character of the opposite sex is called crossplay. The practicality of crossplay and cross-dress stems in part from the abundance in manga of male characters with delicate and somewhat androgynous features. Such characters, known as bishōnen (lit. 'pretty boy'),[71] are Asian equivalent of the elfin boy archetype represented in Western tradition by figures such as Peter Pan and Ariel.[72]

Male to female cosplayers may experience issues when trying to portray a female character because it is hard to maintain the sexualized femininity of a character. Male cosplayers may also be subjected to discrimination,[73] including homophobic comments and being touched without permission. This affects men possibly even more often than it affects women, despite inappropriate contact already being a problem for women who cosplay,[74] as is ""slut-shaming"".[75]

Animegao kigurumi players, a niche group in the realm of cosplay, are often male cosplayers who use zentai and stylized masks to represent female anime characters. These cosplayers completely hide their real features so the original appearance of their characters may be reproduced as literally as possible, and to display all the abstractions and stylizations such as oversized eyes and tiny mouths often seen in Japanese cartoon art.[76] This does not mean that only males perform animegao or that masks are only female.

""Cosplay Is Not Consent"", a movement started in 2013 by Rochelle Keyhan, Erin Filson, and Anna Kegler, brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment in the convention attending cosplay community.[77][78] Harassment of cosplayers include photography without permission, verbal abuse, touching, and groping. Harassment is not limited to women in provocative outfits as male cosplayers talked about being bullied for not fitting certain costume and characters.

Starting in 2014, New York Comic Con placed large signs at the entrance stating that ""Cosplay is Not Consent"". Attendees were reminded to ask permission for photos and respect the person's right to say no.[79] The movement against sexual harassment against cosplayers has continued to gain momentum and awareness since being publicized. Traditional mainstream news media like The Mercury News and Los Angeles Times have reported on the topic, bringing awareness of sexual harassment to those outside of the cosplay community.[80][81]

As cosplay has entered more mainstream media, ethnicity becomes a controversial point. Cosplayers of different skin color than the character are often ridiculed for not being 'accurate' or 'faithful'.[82] Many cosplayers feel as if anyone can cosplay any character, but it becomes complicated when cosplayers are not respectful of the character's ethnicity.[83] These views against non-white cosplayers within the community have been attributed to the lack of representation in the industry and in media.[84] Issues such as blackface, brownface, and yellowface are still controversial since a large part of the cosplay community see these as separate problems, or simply an acceptable part of cosplay.[citation needed]

Cosplay has influenced the advertising industry, in which cosplayers are often used for event work previously assigned to agency models.[64] Some cosplayers have thus transformed their hobby into profitable, professional careers.[85][86][87] Japan's entertainment industry has been home to the professional cosplayers since the rise of Comiket and Tokyo Game Show.[64] The phenomenon is most apparent in Japan but exists to some degree in other countries as well. Professional cosplayers who profit from their art may experience problems related to copyright infringement.[88]

A cosplay model, also known as a cosplay idol, cosplays costumes for anime and manga or video game companies. Good cosplayers are viewed as fictional characters in the flesh, in much the same way that film actors come to be identified in the public mind with specific roles. Cosplayers have modeled for print magazines like Cosmode and a successful cosplay model can become the brand ambassador for companies like Cospa. Some cosplay models can achieve significant recognition. While there are many significant cosplay models, Yaya Han was described as having emerged ""as a well-recognized figure both within and outside cosplay circuits"".[86] Jessica Nigri, used her recognition in cosplay to gain other opportunities such as voice acting and her own documentary on Rooster Teeth. Liz Katz used her fanbase to take her cosplay from a hobby to a successful business venture, sparking debate through the cosplay community whether cosplayers should be allowed to fund and profit from their work.[89][90]

In the 2000s, cosplayers started to push the boundaries of cosplay into eroticism paving the way to ""erocosplay"".[91][92] The advent of social media coupled with crowdfuding platforms like Patreon and OnlyFans have allowed cosplay models to turn cosplay into profitable full-time careers.[93]

During various protests, cosplaying as a satirization of important people and political events. In Myanmar various protests after the 2021 coup d'état various protests occurred with cosplayers. Youth groups protested on the roads by wearing cosplay costumes, skirts, wedding dresses, and other unusual clothing for daily life while holding signboards and vinyl banners that break with the country's more traditional protest messages for the purpose of grabbing attention from both domestic and international press media.[94][95] Other times fictional characters are used to convey a message such as women dressing like characters from The Handmaid's Tale to protest bodily restrictions in the United States.[96]

Cosplayers in Japan used to refer to themselves as reiyā (レイヤー), pronounced ""layer"". Currently in Japan, cosplayers are more commonly called kosupure (コスプレ), pronounced ""ko-su-pray"", as reiyā is more often used to describe layers (i.e. hair, clothes, etc.).[97] Words like cute (kawaii (可愛い)) and cool (kakko ī (かっこ いい)) were often used to describe these changes,[further explanation needed] expressions that were tied with notions of femininity and masculinity.[98] Those who photograph players are called cameko, short for camera kozō or camera boy. Originally, the cameko gave prints of their photos to players as gifts. Increased interest in cosplay events, both on the part of photographers and cosplayers willing to model for them, has led to formalization of procedures at events such as Comiket. Photography takes place within a designated area removed from the exhibit hall. In Japan, costumes are generally not welcome outside of conventions or other designated areas.[99][100]

Since 1998, Tokyo's Akihabara district contains a number of cosplay restaurants, catering to devoted anime and cosplay fans, where the waitresses at such cafés dress as video game or anime characters; maid cafés are particularly popular. In Japan, Tokyo's Harajuku district is the favorite informal gathering place to engage in cosplay in public. Events in Akihabara also draw many cosplayers.

Ishoku-hada (異色肌) is a form of Japanese cosplay where the players use body paint to make their skin color match that of the character they are playing. This allows them to represent anime or video game characters with non-human skin colors.[101]

A 2014 survey for the Comic Market convention in Japan noted that approximately 75% of cosplayers attending the event are female.[102]

Cosplay is common in many East Asian countries. For example, it is a major part of the Comic World conventions taking place regularly in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.[103] Historically, the practice of dressing up as characters from works of fiction can be traced as far as the 17th century late Ming dynasty China.[104]

Western cosplay's origins are based primarily in science fiction and fantasy fandoms. It is also more common for Western cosplayers to recreate characters from live-action series than it is for Japanese cosplayers. Western costumers also include subcultures of hobbyists who participate in Renaissance faires, live action role-playing games, and historical reenactments. Competition at science fiction conventions typically include the masquerade (where costumes are presented on stage and judged formally) and hall costumes[105]

The increasing popularity of Japanese animation outside of Asia during the late 2000s led to an increase in American and other Western cosplayers who portray manga and anime characters. Anime conventions have become more numerous in the West in the previous decade, now competing with science fiction, comic book and historical conferences in attendance. At these gatherings, cosplayers, like their Japanese counterparts, meet to show off their work, be photographed, and compete in costume contests.[106] Convention attendees also just as often dress up as Western comic book or animated characters, or as characters from movies and video games.

Differences in taste still exist across cultures: some costumes that are worn without hesitation by Japanese cosplayers tend to be avoided by Western cosplayers, such as outfits that evoke Nazi uniforms. Some Western cosplayers have also encountered questions of legitimacy when playing characters of canonically different racial backgrounds,[107][108] and people can be insensitive to cosplayers playing as characters who are canonically of other skin color.[109][110] Western cosplayers of anime characters may also be subjected to particular mockery.[111]

In contrast to Japan, the wearing of costumes in public is more accepted in the UK, Ireland, US, Canada and other western countries. These countries have a longer tradition of Halloween costumes, fan costuming and other such activities. As a result, for example, costumed convention attendees can often be seen at local restaurants and eateries, beyond the boundaries of the convention or event.[99][100]

Japan is home to two especially popular cosplay magazines, Cosmode (コスモード) and ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Layers (電撃Layers).[112] Cosmode has the largest share in the market and an English-language digital edition.[113] Another magazine, aimed at a broader, worldwide audience is CosplayGen.[114] In the United States, Cosplay Culture began publication in February 2015.[115] Other magazines include CosplayZine featuring cosplayers from all over the world since October 2015,[116] and Cosplay Realm Magazine which was started in April 2017.[117] There are many books on the subject of cosplay as well.[118]

participants dress as specific characters. Originating from fan costuming at science fiction conventions in 1939, cosplay has grown into a global phenomenon, particularly popular in Japan and the Western world. The term 'cosplay' was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi in 1983 to describe this activity distinct from traditional masquerades. Cosplay encompasses various sources like anime, video games, and comic books, with events featuring competitions and social networks dedicated to it.

Cosplayers often create or commission detailed costumes to accurately portray characters, sometimes engaging in body modifications for authenticity. The practice is linked to self-expression but faces challenges related to physical limitations and societal perceptions. Issues such as harassment have led to movements like ""Cosplay Is Not Consent"" advocating for respectful interactions.

Cosplay's influence extends into professional realms with some cosplayers achieving fame as models or brand ambassadors. Cultural differences affect cosplay practices globally; Japanese cosplayers focus more on anime characters while Western cosplayers include live-action series. Despite controversies over racial representation and costume appropriateness, cosplay remains a vibrant part of fan culture worldwide.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greeting\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the session\n- Quick greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Encouragement for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 2: Evolution of Cosplay\nTLDR: Discussing the history and growth of cosplay\n- Origins at science fiction conventions in 1939\n- Coining of the term 'cosplay' by Nobuyuki Takahashi in 1983\n- Global popularity, especially in Japan and Western world"", ""Scene 3: Cultural Significance and Self-expression\nTLDR: Exploring cosplay as a form of self-expression and its cultural impact\n- Various sources like anime, video games, comic books\n- Role of social networks and competitions in cosplay culture\n- Personal experiences with self-expression through cosplay"", ""Scene 4: Costume Design Challenges and Techniques\nTLDR: Delving into the technical aspects of costume creation\n- Detailed costume design processes (creation vs. commission)\n- Body modifications for authenticity\n- Sharing tips and techniques from personal experiences"", ""Scene 5: Societal Perceptions and Advocacy Movements\nTLDR: Addressing societal challenges faced by cosplayers\n- Physical limitations and societal perceptions of cosplay\n- Harassment issues leading to movements like \""Cosplay Is Not Consent\""\n- Discussion on advocacy for respectful interactions"", ""Scene 6: Professional Opportunities in Cosplay\nTLDR: Examining how cosplay can lead to professional roles\n- Fame as models or brand ambassadors through cosplay \n - Examples from participants\u2019 experiences or observations \n - Cultural differences affecting global practices (Japanese vs. Western focus)"", ""Scene 7: Inclusivity, Diversity, Crossplay, Genderbending \n TLDR : Promoting inclusivity within the community \n - Crossplay & genderbending practices \n - Breaking boundaries & promoting diversity \n - Sharing personal stories & insights"", ""Scene 8 : Visual Documentation & Photography \n TLDR : Importance of capturing moments in cosplay events \n - Techniques for high-quality images at conventions \n - Role of photographers in enhancing visual appeal \n - Participants sharing their favorite photography moments"", ""Scene 9 : Open Floor Discussion & Idea Prioritization \n TLDR : Free-flow discussion allowing natural topic evolution \n - Participants share spontaneous ideas related to previous topics discussed \\ n - Prioritizing concepts for further exploration based on group consensus"", ""Scene 10 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps TLDR : Wrapping up session with final thoughts & future plans \\ n - Summary of key points discussed during brainstorming session\\ n - Outline next steps for exploring prioritized concepts\\ n - Thanking participants for their contributions""]",">>Fan Convention Organizer: Hey, everyone! Welcome to our session on fan conventions. I'm really excited to have you all here today! So, let's set the stage for what we're aiming to achieve—sharing insights and experiences to plan the best fan convention ever. What do you think?

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Um, I'm super pumped to be here! Fan conventions are like the ultimate playground for cosplayers. Imagine if we could create an event where every detail is just perfect—'Nuff said! Maybe we could have workshops on costume-making techniques or even a cosplay parade!

>>Costume Designer: Costume design plays a big role in making conventions immersive. How can we make costumes even better? Maybe we could collaborate with other designers to share tips and tricks.

>>Cultural Historian: Well, cosplay's roots can be traced back to early science fiction conventions of the 1930s, where fans like Forrest J Ackerman and Myrtle R. Douglas donned 'futuristic costumes.' This historical context highlights how cosplay has evolved from a niche activity into a vibrant cultural phenomenon. How do these origins influence today's conventions?

>>Crossplay Advocate: Hey there! You know, crossplay and genderbending are such incredible ways to break boundaries and celebrate diversity at conventions. It's amazing how cosplayers can transform into characters regardless of gender—unbelievable transformation! What about having panels specifically focused on crossplay and genderbending? That would really promote inclusivity.

>>(Phone rings loudly)

>>(Everyone laughs)

>>(Fan Convention Organizer silences phone): Apologies for that interruption! That was funny! Anyway...

>>(Everyone chuckles)

>>(Fan Convention Organizer): Let's dive back into how modern techniques can enhance our convention experience.

>>Costume Designer: Right, thanks for that reminder! As I was saying, modern techniques allow us to create more detailed designs. We could explore new materials or technologies that make costumes more authentic and engaging.

>>Crossplay Advocate: Inclusivity is key! Imagine if we had panels specifically focused on crossplay and genderbending—breaking boundaries and celebrating diversity. We could also host events that showcase diverse characters from different cultures. 
 >>Cultural Historian: You know, cosplay has come a long way since the 1939 World Science Fiction Convention. Back then, fans were just starting to dress up as their favorite characters. When Nobuyuki Takahashi coined 'cosplay' in 1983, it really kicked off a global trend. How do you think this history has shaped today's conventions?

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Absolutely! It's amazing to see how cosplay has grown from those early days. Now it's a worldwide phenomenon with so much creativity and community spirit, especially influenced by Japanese culture. I remember my first convention—it was like stepping into another world!

>>Costume Designer: That's true! The craftsmanship has evolved incredibly. I remember working on a costume where we used thermoplastics and even some 3D printing techniques to get the details just right. It's fascinating how modern cosplayers blend different skills to bring characters to life.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Definitely! Conventions have become vibrant hubs of creativity and community. We now have elaborate cosplay competitions, workshops on costume creation, and panels discussing the cultural impact of cosplay. These events are perfect for fans to showcase their talents and connect with others who share their passion.

>>Crossplay Advocate: And let's not forget how inclusive cosplay has become! Crossplay and genderbending are now integral parts of the community. I once met someone who felt empowered to express themselves through crossplay—it was truly inspiring.

>>Cosplay Photographer: Capturing these moments is such a joy for photographers like me. The diversity at conventions offers endless opportunities for great shots. How do you all feel about photography's role in preserving these vibrant expressions?

>>Cultural Historian: Photography definitely plays a crucial role in documenting the evolution of cosplay. It helps capture the essence of these immersive experiences where fans embody their favorite characters. Speaking of inclusivity, how do you think this linguistic shift towards 'cosplay' has impacted our community?

>>Crossplay Advocate: Oh, it's been huge! Embracing terms like crossplay has allowed people to break boundaries and celebrate individuality more freely. I've seen firsthand how this inclusivity shapes our community—it's heartwarming.

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Yeah, totally—cosplay brings together people from all walks of life! Imagine if we saw more collaboration between cosplayers and other creative fields like film or theater—that would be incredible!

>>Costume Designer: Actually yes—the technical advancements in costume design have revolutionized cosplay too. Modern cosplayers utilize advanced materials like thermoplastics and 3D printing for stunning accuracy.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Conventions are dynamic spaces where creativity knows no bounds! The energy at these events is palpable—you can feel it when you walk through the doors and see all those amazing costumes. 
 >>Cosplay Enthusiast: You know, cosplay is such a cool way to express yourself and connect with others who love the same characters. But it's not always easy! I remember spending hours trying to get my costume just right for a convention last year. What about you guys?
>>Costume Designer: Oh, totally! It's amazing how much skill goes into making these costumes look just like the characters. I once spent weeks perfecting the details on a cape for a competition. Social media platforms like Instagram are great for sharing tips and getting feedback from other designers.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: Right, and those competitions have really changed things up! Imagine being at a convention where cosplayers not only show off their costumes but also perform skits or dances. I've seen some of these moments go viral online, inspiring more people to join in.
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Exactly! And social networks make it so much easier to connect with fellow fans and share our experiences. I met some amazing friends through cosplay groups on Facebook.
>>Cultural Historian: Cosplay has grown so much thanks to fans sharing their creativity online. It's fascinating how it evolved from simple fan costuming at sci-fi conventions to this global community we see today. Have any of you noticed changes in the diversity of characters over time?
>>Crossplay Advocate: Absolutely! Crossplay has really opened up new avenues for self-expression by letting us explore different identities beyond traditional boundaries. Remember that big crossplay event last year? It was incredible seeing everyone push creative limits!
>>Cosplay Photographer: Capturing those moments is like preserving art! Photography lets us document all that creativity and diversity in cosplay, and social networks help spread these visual stories worldwide.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: Speaking of spreading stories, what do you think about hosting virtual cosplay events? We could use platforms like Twitch or Zoom to bring together cosplayers from around the world without travel barriers.
>>Costume Designer: That sounds exciting! Virtual events could offer workshops or panels where creators share techniques live—imagine learning directly from top designers!
>>Cultural Historian: And historically speaking, it's interesting how technology continues to shape cosplay culture by connecting diverse communities globally. 
 >>Costume Designer: You know, the technical aspects of costume creation are fascinating! Precision is key when replicating intricate details, whether you're crafting from scratch or commissioning a piece. Body modifications like temporary tattoos and colored contact lenses can elevate authenticity, but they require careful planning and execution. How do you balance these elements for a seamless cosplay experience?

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Balancing those elements is definitely challenging! It's all about finding that sweet spot where the costume looks amazing and feels comfortable. I remember once wearing contacts that were too dry—it was a nightmare! Comfort has to be part of the fun.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Absolutely, organizing conventions involves ensuring cosplayers have resources and space to showcase their costumes effectively. Dedicated areas for body modifications could really enhance the experience—what do you think about setting up workshops for this?

>>Crossplay Advocate: That's a great idea! Workshops on adapting costumes for different body types and genders would be transformative. Inclusivity is key, especially in crossplay where breaking boundaries makes everyone feel welcome.

>>Cultural Historian: Historically speaking, the evolution of body modifications in cosplay has been quite remarkable. From simple costumes at early conventions to today's intricate designs with temporary tattoos and colored contacts—each era brings new techniques. How have these advancements influenced authenticity and inclusivity?

>>Cosplay Photographer: Capturing those moments is everything! A cosplayer with temporary tattoos and colored contacts really brings the character to life in photos. What if we had dedicated photo booths at conventions? They could offer detailed shots that highlight these features.

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: That's interesting! It'd be great if we could incorporate some of those historical techniques into our workshops—temporary tattoos, colored contacts—they'd be useful for both newbies and seasoned cosplayers alike.

>>Costume Designer: Indeed! Dedicated workshops could provide hands-on experience for cosplayers to master these techniques, enhancing both authenticity and inclusivity.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: You know what? Dedicated photo booths at conventions sound fantastic! We could even match backdrops to characters' worlds—how cool would that be?

>>Cultural Historian: Actually, themed backdrops could enhance visual appeal while fostering inclusivity by allowing cosplayers to represent diverse characters more accurately.

>>Crossplay Advocate: Themed backdrops are definitely a fantastic idea! They can really enhance crossplay by providing an immersive environment.

>>Cosplay Photographer: I agree; themed backdrops could take cosplay photography to another level—imagine ones that match characters' worlds! 
 >>Cosplay Enthusiast: You know, the 'Cosplay Is Not Consent' movement has really helped us cosplayers feel more secure at conventions. I remember a few years ago when it was tough to enjoy events without worrying about unwanted attention. It's great to see how much awareness it's brought. What do you think?

>>Crossplay Advocate: Definitely! It's opened up important conversations about inclusivity and respect. But sometimes, I wonder if we're doing enough to reach everyone who attends these conventions. How can we make sure the message gets across effectively?

>>Costume Designer: That's a good point. The movement has been crucial in addressing harassment issues, but there's always room for improvement. I've seen some cosplayers add hidden pockets or reinforced seams to their costumes as a way to protect themselves and their belongings. Maybe we could explore more practical solutions like that.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Right, the idea of safe zones is appealing, but there are logistical challenges—like finding space and staffing them properly—that we need to consider. It would be amazing if we could pull it off though; it would definitely enhance the experience for everyone.

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Workshops and panels focused on respectful interactions could be another way forward. We could have sessions on how to approach cosplayers properly and what behaviors are unacceptable, but again, we'd need resources and time slots at conventions.

>>Costume Designer: Incorporating features into costume designs is one thing, but ensuring attendees understand why they're necessary is another challenge altogether. How do you think we can educate people effectively?

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Well, having clear signage and trained staff might help guide cosplayers to safe areas efficiently. But let's not forget about costs—how do we fund these initiatives? Maybe sponsorships or partnerships with organizations that support our cause?

>>Cultural Historian: You know, this movement reminds me of past efforts where communities came together to redefine norms around personal space—like public campaigns against street harassment in urban areas during the 80s. Drawing from those experiences might offer insights into overcoming current challenges.

>>Crossplay Advocate: Instead of superheroes standing up for respect, maybe it's more about all of us working together as a community to ensure everyone's safety and comfort at these events.

>>Cosplay Photographer: Capturing cosplayers in themed photo zones sounds fantastic! But we'd need careful planning around location and security measures so everyone feels respected while showcasing their craftsmanship.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Let's brainstorm ways to make these ideas feasible! A buddy system where experienced cosplayers guide newcomers could foster community support while navigating conventions safely.

>>Cultural Historian: Reflecting on historical advocacy efforts can indeed provide valuable lessons for today’s movements—especially in terms of organizing resources effectively and rallying community support. 
 >>Fan Convention Organizer: So, um, cosplay can really open doors professionally! Picture this: cosplayers becoming brand ambassadors or even landing modeling gigs. Can you imagine the impact of showcasing their creativity on such platforms? It's pretty amazing!

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: You know, I've seen friends become brand ambassadors for big companies just because of their awesome costumes. It's like turning your hobby into a career! Seriously, imagine getting paid to do what you love. How cool is that?

>>Costume Designer: Yeah, and getting those little details right really helps cosplayers stand out to brands. But it’s not always easy—sometimes it takes hours just to perfect one small part of a costume.

>>Cultural Historian: Well, historically speaking, cosplay has evolved from simple fan costuming to a significant cultural phenomenon with professional opportunities. In the early days, cosplayers were often seen as hobbyists, but now they can become brand ambassadors and models. This shift mirrors broader acceptance and commercialization in both Japanese and Western contexts.

>>Crossplay Advocate: Hey, you know, crossplay and genderbending can really open up professional opportunities too! Imagine cosplayers breaking boundaries by representing diverse characters and becoming ambassadors for inclusivity. It's incredible how embracing different identities can attract brands looking to promote diversity!

>>Cosplay Photographer: Uh, capturing cosplayers in their element can really elevate their profiles! Imagine a photo that perfectly showcases the intricate details of a costume and the passion behind it. Brands love seeing that kind of dedication and creativity.

>>Fan Convention Organizer: And it's not just about individual success; it's about building connections within the community too! Cosplayers collaborating with photographers to create stunning portfolios—that's where real magic happens!

>>Costume Designer: Indeed! The technical expertise involved in costume design truly elevates a cosplayer's profile. But sometimes it’s tough balancing creativity with what brands want—they might have specific requirements that limit artistic freedom.

>>Cultural Historian: Interestingly enough, this evolution reflects broader cultural acceptance and commercialization of cosplay across different regions—Japanese versus Western practices have unique nuances influencing these opportunities.

>>Crossplay Advocate: Like I said earlier—it's not just about costumes! Crossplay showcases versatility and creativity; brands want ambassadors who break boundaries and represent diverse identities.

>>Cosplay Photographer: You know what? Capturing those moments where cosplayers shine through visuals—that’s what draws brands in! It’s all about authenticity and passion. 
 >>Crossplay Advocate: Hey, speaking of authenticity and passion, crossplay really embodies that spirit! It's all about breaking boundaries and embracing diversity. Can you feel it?
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Absolutely! It allows us to express our creativity in new ways. Imagine if everyone felt free to cosplay any character they love, regardless of gender. Seriously, it's all about making the community more inclusive. What do you think?
>>Costume Designer: It's amazing how crossplay challenges norms and shows off our skills in costume design. It's all about getting the details right for different body types while keeping true to the character.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: We could promote inclusivity with dedicated panels where cosplayers share their experiences and techniques. Can you imagine the impact? Let's make it happen!
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: And having more workshops focused on these practices at conventions would be fantastic for inclusivity!
>>Cultural Historian: Historically, crossplay and genderbending have roots in the early days of fan costuming. In fact, um, the practice of portraying characters regardless of gender can be traced back to the 1939 World Science Fiction Convention—
>>Crossplay Advocate (interrupting): Wait a second—1939? That's incredible! How did they manage that back then?
>>Cultural Historian: Yes, indeed! Back then, it was quite revolutionary for cosplayers to challenge societal expectations even today.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: Alright, so let's think about how we can make these workshops truly engaging! I mean, imagine having interactive sessions where attendees can try their hand at crossplay techniques right there. The energy would be fantastic! 
 >>Cosplay Photographer: Capturing those moments at conventions is like freezing time! The right lighting and angles can make a cosplayer's hard work truly shine. Picture perfect! What do you think?
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: It's amazing how a single photo can capture the essence of a character and the effort put into the costume. Some of my favorite moments are when photographers get that perfect shot that makes you feel like you're in another world! Seriously, it's such a win for everyone involved.
>>Costume Designer: Absolutely, the details in costume design really matter for great photos. Things like fabric texture and color can make a huge difference. How about we have more workshops at conventions to help cosplayers with these details?
>>Fan Convention Organizer: That's a great idea! And having dedicated photo booths with themed backdrops would be awesome too. Imagine cosplayers posing in settings that match their characters' worlds—so cool!
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Totally agree! Those themed backdrops really help bring the characters to life and make the photos look like scenes straight out of a movie or game. Interactive photo booths with props and special effects would be amazing!
>>Cultural Historian: Photography at conventions has come a long way from amateur snapshots to professional shoots. This evolution has really enhanced how we experience and remember these events.
>>Crossplay Advocate: Building on what was said about capturing transformative moments, focusing on crossplay could highlight diversity even more. It’s incredible to see those transformations!
>>Cosplay Photographer: Absolutely! It's all about capturing those creative moments that showcase dedication.
>>Costume Designer: Indeed! If we incorporate more detailed costume workshops at conventions, it could support cosplayers in achieving higher quality designs that truly shine in photographs.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: Right! And having interactive photo booths with props would be fantastic too—cosplayers could pose with special effects matching their characters' worlds.
>>Cultural Historian: Early fan conventions had minimal visual documentation, often relying on amateur snapshots. As cosplay became more sophisticated and widespread, photographers began specializing in capturing these intricate costumes and performances. This shift not only elevated the art form but also helped preserve its history for future generations. 
 >>Fan Convention Organizer: We could set up interactive workshops for cosplay photography—what do you all think about including themed backdrops?
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: That sounds awesome! Themed backdrops and props would make the photos look amazing. Can you imagine how epic they'd be?
>>Costume Designer: Definitely, themed backdrops would make the photos pop! We should also think about interactive lighting setups to highlight specific features.
>>Crossplay Advocate: I love the idea of workshops for crossplay techniques! Maybe we could also include sessions on makeup tips for genderbending.
>>Cultural Historian: That's a great idea! Adding historical context could really enrich these workshops. Cosplay has always been more than just costumes; it's about self-expression and community.
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Workshops that combine cosplay photography with historical context would be amazing! Learning how cosplay has evolved while getting tips on capturing those perfect shots sounds fantastic.
>>Costume Designer: Indeed, combining cosplay photography with historical context is fascinating. We could explore how costume design techniques have evolved over time.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: Live demonstrations from renowned cosplayers showing off their techniques would be incredible. Seeing craftsmanship in action and learning directly from experts sounds like a dream come true.
>>Cultural Historian: Integrating historical context into these workshops can provide attendees with a deeper appreciation for costume design's evolution and cultural significance.
>>Cosplay Enthusiast: You know, live demonstrations from renowned cosplayers showing off their techniques would be incredible!
>>Costume Designer: Absolutely! Experts showcasing intricate costume creation details would allow attendees to witness craftsmanship at its finest.
>>Fan Convention Organizer: A cosplay parade showcasing the evolution of costume design over the years would be fantastic. It'd celebrate our community's creativity and show how styles have changed.
>>Cultural Historian: A parade like that could serve as a living timeline for attendees, illustrating how styles transformed from early fan conventions to today's vibrant community. 
 >>Fan Convention Organizer: Alright, everyone, we've covered some fantastic ideas today! We've talked about interactive workshops, themed photo booths, and a cosplay parade showcasing costume design evolution.

>>Cosplay Enthusiast: Oh hey, speaking of the cosplay parade—I just had a thought—what if we included a segment for crossplay? It could really highlight diversity in costume design. You know, it’d be awesome to see different interpretations!

>>Crossplay Advocate: That's a brilliant idea! We should definitely explore that further. I mean, it would add so much variety and inclusivity to the event.

>>Costume Designer: Including crossplay would showcase diversity and demonstrate versatile costume design techniques. Maybe we could plan specific workshops around this theme too.

>>Cultural Historian: This could provide an excellent opportunity to delve into the historical aspects of crossplay. Do you think it might attract attendees interested in its cultural significance?

>>Cosplay Photographer: Yeah! And from a photography perspective, capturing those diverse designs would be visually stunning. Imagine all the unique shots we could get!

>>Fan Convention Organizer: Great points! So our next steps include exploring these concepts further and planning detailed sessions for our next convention. Thank you all for your amazing contributions! Let's make this event unforgettable."
