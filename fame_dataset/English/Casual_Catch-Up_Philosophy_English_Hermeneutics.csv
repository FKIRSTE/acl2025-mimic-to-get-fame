Hermeneutics,"

Hermeneutics (/hɜːrməˈnjuːtɪks/)[1] is the theory and methodology of interpretation,[2][3] especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts.[4][5] As necessary, hermeneutics may include the art of understanding and communication.[6]

Modern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication,[7][8] as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or exegesis, of scripture, and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation.[9] The terms hermeneutics and exegesis are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and nonverbal[7][8] communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.

Hermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, double hermeneutic).

Hermeneutics is derived from the Greek word ἑρμηνεύω (hermēneuō, ""translate, interpret""),[10] from ἑρμηνεύς (hermeneus, ""translator, interpreter""), of uncertain etymology (R. S. P. Beekes (2009) suggests a Pre-Greek origin).[11] The technical term ἑρμηνεία (hermeneia, ""interpretation, explanation"") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of Aristotle's work Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας (""Peri Hermeneias""), commonly referred to by its Latin title De Interpretatione and translated in English as On Interpretation. It is one of the earliest (c. 360 BCE) extant philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of ""hermeneutics"" places it within the boundaries of the sacred.[12]: 21  A divine message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.[12]: 21–22 

Folk etymology places its origin with Hermes, the mythological Greek deity who was the 'messenger of the gods'.[13] Aside from being a mediator among the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the underworld upon death.

Moreover, Hermes was considered the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief, and a trickster.[13] These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way.[13] The Greek view of language as consisting of signs that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.[14]: 63 

Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, Hillel the Elder, although the thirteen principles set forth in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., a fortiori argument [known in Hebrew as קל וחומר – kal v'chomer]) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears (Gezerah Shavah). The rabbis did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.[15]

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the Tanakh (the Jewish Biblical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found secret or mystical levels of understanding.

Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the Vedas, the earliest holy texts of Hinduism. The Mimamsa was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what Dharma (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini (c. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by Śabara (c. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast Buddhist literature, particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the Buddha (Buddhavacana) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract skillful means of reaching spiritual enlightenment or nirvana. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have very different interpretive traditions.

The early patristic traditions of biblical exegesis had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

Augustine offers hermeneutics and homiletics in his De doctrina christiana. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine's hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the Platonism of his time, he recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.[16]

There is traditionally a fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.[17]

Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means ""a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the 'plain meaning' expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context."" The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.[18]

Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.[18]

Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as typological, where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as ""types"" (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah's Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a ""type"" of the Christian church that God designed from the start.[18]

This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It claims to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the Jewish Kabbalah, which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of Hebrew words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval Zohar. In Christianity, it can be seen in Mariology.[18]

The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new humanist education of the 15th century as a historical and critical methodology for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla proved in 1440 that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the Protestant Reformation brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. Martin Luther and John Calvin emphasized scriptura sui ipsius interpres (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used brevitas et facilitas as an aspect of theological hermeneutics.[19]

The rationalist Enlightenment led hermeneutists, especially Protestant exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.[20]

Nineteenth- and twentieth-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (Verstehen) through the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher (Romantic hermeneutics[21] and methodological hermeneutics),[22] August Böckh (methodological hermeneutics),[23] Wilhelm Dilthey (epistemological hermeneutics),[24] Martin Heidegger (ontological hermeneutics,[25] hermeneutic phenomenology,[26][27][28] and transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology),[29] Hans-Georg Gadamer (ontological hermeneutics),[30] Leo Strauss (Straussian hermeneutics),[31] Paul Ricœur (hermeneutic phenomenology),[32] Walter Benjamin (Marxist hermeneutics),[33] Ernst Bloch (Marxist hermeneutics),[34][33] Jacques Derrida (radical hermeneutics, namely deconstruction),[35][36] Richard Kearney (diacritical hermeneutics), Fredric Jameson (Marxist hermeneutics),[37] and John Thompson (critical hermeneutics).

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of analytic philosophy, there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger's philosophy of science, an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning realism and anti-realism: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's hermeneutic idealism (the thesis that meaning determines reference or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities)[38] and for Heidegger's hermeneutic realism[39] (the thesis that (a) there is a nature in itself and science can give us an explanation of how that nature works, and (b) that (a) is compatible with the ontological implications of our everyday practices).[40]

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include Georg Henrik von Wright and Peter Winch. Roy J. Howard termed this approach analytic hermeneutics.[41]

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include Charles Taylor[20] (engaged hermeneutics)[42] and Dagfinn Føllesdal.[20]

Wilhelm Dilthey broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, ""The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life"" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on empathy, understood as a direct identification with the Other. Interpretation, on a hermeneutical conception of empathy[43] involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind (human sciences) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

In the 20th century, Martin Heidegger's philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to existential understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct—and thus more authentic—way of being-in-the-world (In-der-Welt-sein) than merely as ""a way of knowing.""[44] For example, he called for a ""special hermeneutic of empathy"" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of ""other minds"" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)[45]

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same scientific methods that are used in the natural sciences, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of antipositivism. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the social context in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the hermeneutic circle. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the sociologist Max Weber.

Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not per se without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition—all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.

New hermeneutic is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through existentialism. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.[46] This is called the event of language. Ernst Fuchs,[47] Gerhard Ebeling, and James M. Robinson are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

The method of Marxist hermeneutics has been developed by the work of, primarily, Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels[33] (""Trauerspiel"" literally means ""mourning play"" but is often translated as ""tragic drama"").[48] Fredric Jameson draws on Biblical hermeneutics, Ernst Bloch,[49] and the work of Northrop Frye, to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential The Political Unconscious. Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled ""On Interpretation""[50] Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the mode of production, and eventually, history.[51]

Karl Popper first used the term ""objective hermeneutics"" in his Objective Knowledge (1972).[52]

In 1992, the Association for Objective Hermeneutics (AGOH) was founded in Frankfurt am Main by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.[53]

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

Our approach has grown out of the empirical study of family interactions as well as reflection upon the procedures of interpretation employed in our research. For the time being we shall refer to it as objective hermeneutics in order to distinguish it clearly  from  traditional  hermeneutic  techniques  and orientations.  The  general  significance  for  sociological  analysis  of objective hermeneutics issues from the fact that, in the social sciences, interpretive methods constitute the fundamental procedures of measurement and of the generation of research data relevant to theory. From our perspective, the standard, nonhermeneutic  methods of quantitative social research can only be justified because they permit a shortcut in generating data (and research ""economy"" comes about under specific conditions). Whereas  the conventional methodological attitude in the social sciences justifies qualitative approaches as  exploratory or preparatory activities, to be succeeded by standardized approaches and techniques as the actual scientific procedures (assuring  precision, validity, and objectivity), we regard hermeneutic  procedures as the basic method for gaining precise and valid knowledge in the social  sciences. However, we do not simply reject alternative approaches dogmatically. They are in fact useful wherever the loss in precision and objectivity necessitated by the requirement of research economy can be condoned and tolerated in the light of prior hermeneutically elucidated research experiences.[54]
Bernard Lonergan's (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the postmodern hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist Frederick G. Lawrence.[55]

Paul Ricœur (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer. [citation needed][vague]

Karl-Otto Apel (1922–2017) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American semiotics. He applied his model to discourse ethics with political motivations akin to those of critical theory. [citation needed]

Jürgen Habermas (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. [citation needed] He also criticized Marxism and previous members of the Frankfurt School for missing the hermeneutical dimension of critical theory.

Habermas incorporated the notion of the lifeworld and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. [citation needed] He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory. [citation needed]

Rudolf Makkreel (b. 1939) has proposed an orientational hermeneutics that brings out the contextualizing function of reflective judgment. It extends ideas of Kant and Dilthey to supplement the dialogical approach of Gadamer with a diagnostic approach that can deal with an ever-changing and multicultural world. [citation needed]

Andrés Ortiz-Osés (1943–2021) developed his symbolic hermeneutics as the Mediterranean response to Northern European hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that meaning is a symbolic healing of injury.[citation needed]

Two other important hermeneutic scholars[according to whom?] are Jean Grondin (b. 1955) and Maurizio Ferraris (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot[who?] coined the term and discipline of analogic hermeneutics[original research?], which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. [citation needed] He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the history of thought. [vague]

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist Emilio Betti and the American literary theorist E. D. Hirsch.

In archaeology, hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in stone tools, where descriptions such as ""scraper"" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of microwear analysis some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too relativist and that their own interpretations are based on common-sense evaluation.[56]

There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, such as Christian Norberg-Schulz, and Nader El-Bizri in the circles of phenomenology. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).[57] Dalibor Vesely situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.[58] This tradition fits within a critique of the Enlightenment[59] and has also informed design-studio teaching. Adrian Snodgrass sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.[60] He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.[61] Along with Richard Coyne, he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.[62]

Hermeneutics motivates a broad range of applications in educational theory. The connection between hermeneutics and education has deep historical roots. The ancient Greeks gave the interpretation of poetry a central place in educational practice, as indicated by Dilthey: ""systematic exegesis (hermeneia) of the poets developed out of the demands of the educational system.""[63]

Gadamer more recently wrote on the topic of education,[64][65] and more recent treatments of educational issues across various hermeneutical approaches are to be found in Fairfield[66] and Gallagher.[67]

Environmental hermeneutics applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including ""nature"" and ""wilderness"" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics[68][69] ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both critical theory and constitutive theory (both of which have made important inroads into the postpositivist branch of international relations theory and political science), it has been applied to international relations.

Steve Smith refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding foundationalist yet postpositivist theory of international relations.

Radical postmodernism is an example of a postpositivist anti-foundationalist paradigm of international relations.[70]

Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to legal theory since at least the 11th century.

In the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance, the schools of glossatores, commentatores, and usus modernus distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of ""laws"" (mainly Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis). The University of Bologna gave birth to a ""legal Renaissance"" in the 11th century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as Irnerius and Johannes Gratian. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by Thomas Aquinas and Alberico Gentili.

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Emilio Betti, among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. Legal interpretivism, most famously Ronald Dworkin's, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

In qualitative research, the beginnings of phenomenology stem from German philosopher and researcher Edmund Husserl.[71] In his early days, Husserl studied mathematics, but over time his disinterest with empirical methods led him to philosophy and eventually phenomenology. Husserl's phenomenology inquires on the specifics of a certain experience or experiences and attempts to unfold the meaning of experience in everyday life.[71] Phenomenology started as philosophy and then developed into methodology over time. American researcher Don Ihde contributed to phenomenological research methodology through what he described as experimental phenomenology: ""Phenomenology, in the first instance, is like an investigative science, an essential component of which is an experiment.""[72] His work contributed heavily to the implementation of phenomenology as a methodology.[72][73]

The beginnings of hermeneutic phenomenology stem from a German researcher and student of Husserl, Martin Heidegger.[71] Both researchers attempted to pull out the lived experiences of others through philosophical concepts, but Heidegger's main difference from Husserl was his belief that consciousness was not separate from the world but a formation of who we are as living individuals.[71] Hermeneutic phenomenology stresses that every event or encounter involves some type of interpretation from an individual's background, and that we cannot separate this from an individual's development through life.[71] Ihde also focuses on hermeneutic phenomenology within his early work, and draws connections between Husserl and French philosopher Paul Ricoeur's work in the field.[73] Ricoeur focuses on the importance of symbols and linguistics within hermeneutic phenomenology.[73] Overall, hermeneutic phenomenological research focuses on historical meanings and experiences, and their developmental and social effects on individuals.[74]

Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book Hermeneutic Communism, when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, ""A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history).""[75]

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view interpretation as anarchy and affirmed that ""existence is interpretation"" and that ""hermeneutics is weak thought.""

Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since Sigmund Freud first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for The Interpretation of Dreams ""makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[i.e.] 'interpreting' a dream implies assigning a 'meaning' to it.""[76]

The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–1950s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's hermeneutical phenomenology.

Psychologists and Cognitive science have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to cognitivism.[77]

Hubert Dreyfus's critique of conventional artificial intelligence has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger (cf. Embodied cognition) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (cf. Discursive psychology).

Hermeneutics is also influential in humanistic psychology.[78]

The understanding of a theological text depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as Paul Ricœur, have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).

Mircea Eliade, as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane.[79] The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a hierophany.[80] The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered.[81] Myth is interpreted by Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.[82]

The term was notably used in 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI saying the Second Vatican Council needs to be viewed through the lens of a ""hermeneutic of reform"" rather than a ""hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture"".[83] In subsequent discourse, this has become a ""hermeneutic of continuity"" contrasted with a ""hermeneutic of rupture,"" and applied to dissident tendencies questioning recent church teaching in general[84] and the teaching of Pope Francis.[85]  Following this, the term is now widely used: e.g. of suspicion,[86] of tradition and kenosis,[87] and of synodality.[88] Benedict also spoke of the ""hermeneutic of the cross"", ""of faith"" necessary for exegesis,[89] ""of unity"",[90] while deploring a ""hermeneutic of politics"".[91] Francis has warned against a ""hermeneutic of conspiracy"".[92] Pope John Paul II taught a ""hermeneutic of the gift"".[93]

In the field of safety science, and especially in the study of human reliability, scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by ergonomist Donald Taylor that mechanist models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.[94]

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety taxonomies that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of qualitative data.[95]

In sociology, hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes both context[96] and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or world view from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the ""thumbs-up"" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult.[97] Similarly, marking a piece of paper and putting it into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of an election (the act of putting a ballot paper into a box).

Friedrich Schleiermacher, widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's ""hermeneutic circle"" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part.[98] Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer.[99]

Jürgen Habermas criticizes Gadamer's hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.[100]

methodology of hermeneutics, particularly its application to biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical works. Modern hermeneutics encompasses both verbal and non-verbal communication, semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Initially used for scriptural exegesis, hermeneutics has expanded to general interpretation across various disciplines such as law, history, and theology. The term originates from Greek words related to translation and interpretation. Early applications involved interpreting divine messages with inherent uncertainty. Hermes, the mythological messenger of the gods, symbolizes the interpretative roles in hermeneutics due to his multifaceted nature. Jewish hermeneutics emphasized error-free interpretation of the Tanakh through contextual examination. Vedic hermeneutics focused on understanding Dharma via detailed study of the Vedas. Buddhist hermeneutics aimed at spiritual enlightenment through textual analysis. Biblical hermeneutics evolved with Augustine's emphasis on humility and love in scriptural study. Hermeneutic methods diversified during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods with figures like Schleiermacher advocating for avoiding misunderstanding through grammatical and psychological laws. Heidegger's existential approach influenced 20th-century hermeneutics by emphasizing understanding rooted in fundamental ontology. Gadamer further developed these ideas by highlighting tradition's role in comprehension while Marxist hermeneutics linked textual interpretation to historical materialism. Hermeneutic principles have been applied across various fields including archaeology, architecture, education, environmental studies, international relations, law, qualitative research, psychoanalysis, safety science, sociology.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants greet each other and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and friendly exchanges\n- Mention of the meeting objectives (building rapport, sharing updates, discussing non-work-related topics)\n- Light-hearted comments to ease into the conversation"", ""Scene 2: Sharing Updates\nTLDR: Participants share recent personal and professional updates.\n- Philosophy Professor shares insights from recent research or lectures\n- Biblical Scholar discusses new findings or interpretations in biblical texts\n- Semiotics Expert talks about interesting symbols encountered recently\n- Historian shares notable historical events or discoveries related to hermeneutics\n- Literary Critic discusses recent literary analyses or favorite texts\n- Cultural Anthropologist shares observations from recent cultural studies"", ""Scene 3: Hermeneutics Discussion\nTLDR: Participants delve into the theory and methodology of hermeneutics.\n- Overview of hermeneutics by Philosophy Professor with focus on philosophical texts\n- Biblical Scholar explains historical context and evolution of biblical hermeneutics\n- Semiotics Expert discusses semiotic principles in interpretation\n- Historian provides historical perspective on hermeneutic methods across eras\n- Literary Critic explores narrative techniques in literary hermeneutics"", ""Scene 4: Cross-disciplinary Insights\nTLDR: Participants discuss how hermeneutic principles apply across various fields.\n- Exploration of law, history, theology applications by participants with relevant expertise areas\n- Discussion on qualitative research and psychoanalysis by Semiotics Expert and Cultural Anthropologist\n- Insights into environmental studies, international relations, safety science by Historian"", ""Scene 5: Personal Experiences Related to Hermeneutics\nTLDR: Participants share personal anecdotes related to their work in hermeneutics.\n- Philosophy Professor recounts a memorable teaching moment involving complex interpretation\n- Biblical Scholar shares a profound experience interpreting scripture in a unique context\n- Semiotics Expert talks about an intriguing symbol analysis that led to new understanding\n- Historian reflects on a significant historical event that shaped their perspective on hermeneutics"", ""Scene 6: Spontaneous Contributions and Off-topic Moments \nTLDR: Allow space for natural topic evolution and brief off-topic discussions.\n - Open floor for any participant to bring up spontaneous thoughts or questions \n - Encourage light-hearted off-topic moments to strengthen team rapport \n - Share humorous anecdotes or interesting non-work-related stories"", ""Scene 7: Natural Disagreement and Resolution \n TLDR : Facilitate healthy debate among participants with differing viewpoints. \n - Philosophy Professor poses rhetorical question provoking thought \n - Biblical Scholar offers counterpoint based on scriptural interpretation \n - Semiotics Expert interjects with symbolic analysis perspective \n - Encourage respectful dialogue leading to resolution"", ""Scene 8 : Closing Remarks \\ n TLDR : Summarize key points discussed and conclude meeting. \\ n - Recap main discussion points by each participant briefly \\ n - Express appreciation for contributions made during meeting\\ n - Plan next catch-up session if needed""]",">>Cultural Anthropologist: Hey everyone! It's great to see you all here. I'm really looking forward to catching up today.
>>Philosophy Professor: Hi folks! These meetings are always interesting because we get so many different viewpoints.
>>Biblical Scholar: Hello! I love hearing everyone's unique insights during these discussions.
>>Semiotics Expert: Good morning! It's fascinating how we all bring different ideas to the table.
>>Literary Critic: Hi there! These meetings are refreshing—each story adds something new to our conversations.
>>Historian: Hey team! I enjoy these catch-ups; they show how our stories connect in unexpected ways. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: You know, my recent research has been quite enlightening. It delves into the philosophical implications of hermeneutics in modern contexts, revealing how our preconceptions shape our interpretations and understanding of texts. For instance, during a seminar last week, students had vastly different takes on a single passage based on their backgrounds.

>>Biblical Scholar: That's fascinating! Let's dive into the historical context of biblical hermeneutics. The interpretation of sacred texts has evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural and philosophical shifts. Understanding these changes can really shed light on how we approach biblical texts today. I remember reading about how medieval scholars interpreted certain passages very differently from contemporary theologians.

>>Semiotics Expert: Hmm... I've been thinking about this symbol—the labyrinth. From a semiotic perspective, it represents both confusion and enlightenment depending on one's journey through it. What does this signify in our understanding of texts? Could this duality be applied to philosophical works as well?

>>Historian: Actually, exploring the historical evolution of hermeneutics is fascinating! From its origins in interpreting sacred texts to its expansion into broader philosophical and literary realms, hermeneutics has continually adapted to cultural and intellectual shifts. What can we deduce from this? And how do you think these shifts impact our current methodologies?

>>Literary Critic: You see, in my recent class discussion on 'The Great Gatsby,' I explored how Fitzgerald's narrative techniques reveal the complexities of the American Dream. The use of unreliable narration and symbolic imagery profoundly shapes our understanding of the characters' aspirations and disillusionments. Students often bring up their own experiences with ambition when discussing these themes.

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Wow! It's fascinating how hermeneutics can bridge cultural divides, you know? In some societies, the interpretation of symbols and texts is deeply tied to communal rituals. What does this tell us about society's role in shaping understanding? I once observed a ritual in South America where storytelling was central to community identity.

>>Philosophy Professor: To put it in perspective, hermeneutics not only bridges different disciplines but also reveals underlying preconceptions that shape our interpretations. How do cultural biases influence our interpretation across various fields? For example, could your labyrinth symbol analysis apply here?

>>Biblical Scholar: Indeed! The historical evolution of biblical hermeneutics shows a dynamic interplay between culture and interpretation. Each era brings its own lens through which sacred texts are understood—reflecting prevailing philosophical currents. How might these insights help us address contemporary issues like religious tolerance?

>>Literary Critic: Consider 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison; her narrative techniques like fragmented storytelling reveal the haunting legacy of slavery. These techniques deepen our understanding while challenging us to confront historical complexities embedded within the story. This often sparks intense discussions among students about race relations today.

>>Philosophy Professor: In essence, hermeneutics serves as a lens through which we examine language and meaning across disciplines. How do cultural biases influence our interpretation of philosophical texts? And what practical applications can we derive from these principles for today's educational systems?

>>Semiotics Expert: Let’s decode that labyrinth symbol further—it signifies complexity in human understanding too! What does this tell us about approaching hermeneutics? Could it suggest that navigating through different interpretative frameworks might lead to deeper insights?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: In cultural contexts...hermeneutics often reveals how communal rituals foster deeper understanding across diverse societies—it's fascinating seeing interpretations reflect yet shape identities! How might these principles help us better understand global communication practices today? 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Hermeneutics isn't just about analyzing texts; it helps us understand human experiences deeply. It challenges our biases and preconceptions, leading to a richer comprehension of both ancient and modern works.

>>Biblical Scholar: Cultural shifts have changed how we interpret sacred texts over time. How does this affect our biases today?

>>Semiotics Expert: Semiotics gives us a unique way to look at signs and symbols in texts. The labyrinth, for instance, shows both confusion and clarity.

>>Historian: Actually, let's consider the historical evolution of hermeneutics across different eras...

>>Literary Critic (interrupting): That's interesting! And speaking of evolution, Fitzgerald's techniques in 'The Great Gatsby' highlight the elusive nature of the American Dream. How do you think this affects our views on success today?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Um, hermeneutics offers a unique perspective on communal rituals... By the way, did anyone catch that documentary on ancient storytelling traditions last night?

>>Philosophy Professor: Like Heidegger's hermeneutic circle suggests—our understanding is tied to our preconceptions and historical context. So what does that say about how dynamic interpretation really is?

>>Biblical Scholar: Augustine emphasized humility in interpreting Scripture. These principles continue to influence modern interpretations.

>>Semiotics Expert: I see your point, but I think modern interpretations have moved beyond Augustine's principles. Decoding the labyrinth further shows it symbolizes not just confusion but also clarity—the journey itself mirrors our interpretative process.

>>Literary Critic: In 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison, fragmented storytelling reveals slavery's haunting legacy on identity. This shapes our understanding of trauma in literature.

>>Historian: Remarkable! During the Renaissance period, scholars like Lorenzo Valla used hermeneutic methods to challenge established texts—uncovering forgeries even! What can we deduce from this about interpretation's power in shaping history?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Fascinating! Hermeneutics helps us see how societies use rituals to construct identities—what does that tell us about shared human experiences across cultures? 
 >>Biblical Scholar: Let's dive into how historical shifts have influenced the interpretation of sacred texts. It's not just about their spiritual essence; we need to consider the cultural and philosophical contexts that have shaped these interpretations over time. How do these evolving perspectives enrich our understanding?

>>Philosophy Professor: That's a great point. You know, when we talk about interpreting legal texts, it's similar—we're looking at the principles and societal values behind them. This makes me wonder, what does this say about our concept of justice?

>>Semiotics Expert: Speaking of interpretation, let's look at how signs and symbols in qualitative research can reveal deeper meanings in human behavior. These symbolic layers are crucial for understanding societal patterns. What insights can we gain from this approach?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: Building on that idea, storytelling traditions aren't just entertainment—they're essential for preserving history and imparting values across cultures. From an anthropological perspective, how does this shape societal norms?

>>Historian: Absolutely! And if we apply this lens to international relations, interpreting diplomatic texts can uncover not just agreements but also power dynamics and cultural contexts. What does this tell us about global diplomacy?

>>Philosophy Professor: Right, and in safety science, analyzing accidents goes beyond mechanical failures—it's about understanding complex narratives involving human behavior. How should this influence our approach to risk management?

>>Biblical Scholar: Exactly! When considering scripture, historical context is key to understanding sacred texts. The shifts over centuries have deeply impacted theological interpretations—

>>Literary Critic (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! I was thinking about storytelling's universal appeal—it connects so well with what you mentioned earlier.

>>Biblical Scholar (responding): Absolutely! Storytelling transcends boundaries; it's integral both to religious texts and secular narratives alike.

>>Semiotics Expert: Speaking of symbols, think about the labyrinth often used in qualitative research—it represents the complexity of human experiences. Decoding these symbols can reveal patterns that aren't immediately obvious.

>>Literary Critic: That reminds me of 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison—using interpretation lets us explore themes like trauma and memory beyond surface plots. How does storytelling deepen our understanding of human experiences? 
 >>Biblical Scholar: You know, when I was interpreting scripture from the early church days, I found this passage that seemed contradictory at first. But then I realized it was reflecting the cultural debates of that time! It really showed me how important it is to consider historical context.
>>Philosophy Professor: During one of my lectures on Plato's cave allegory, a student asked if those shadows could be reflections of deeper truths instead of just illusions. That question totally shifted our discussion and made us think about how interpretations can change over time.
>>Semiotics Expert: You know, consider this symbol: the labyrinth. In my research, I encountered a labyrinth motif in an ancient manuscript that seemed to represent not just physical entrapment but also a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. This analysis led me to understand how symbols can encapsulate complex human experiences and emotions.
>>Historian: Actually, let's explore a pivotal moment in history that profoundly influenced hermeneutics. The discovery by Lorenzo Valla that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery marked a turning point. This revelation challenged established beliefs and demonstrated how historical analysis can reshape our understanding of texts and their authority.
>>Literary Critic: Well, while analyzing 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison, I encountered a passage where Sethe's memories intertwine with her present reality. This narrative technique reveals not only the trauma she carries but also how it shapes her identity and actions. What does this imply about storytelling's power in uncovering deeper truths?
>>Cultural Anthropologist (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! Isn't there an interesting parallel between Plato's cave and communal rituals? Both seem to deal with perceptions versus reality.
>>Philosophy Professor: Absolutely! That's an excellent point. During a seminar, I encouraged students to consider not just the shadows as illusions but as reflections of societal constructs shaping our perceptions. This exercise revealed how interpretations can be influenced by contemporary contexts and personal biases.

>>Semiotics Expert: Um... decoding further into labyrinth symbolism—one particular analysis showed it represents not only physical journeys but mirrors psychological processes like confronting one's fears.
>>Historian: That's fascinating! How do you think this ties into historical narratives? 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, it's interesting how different cultures use symbols to convey complex ideas. Like, um, in some traditions, the labyrinth represents both a physical journey and a spiritual quest. It's like navigating through IKEA—ever tried finding your way out of there? Fascinating!
>>Philosophy Professor: Consider this: the labyrinth not only represents a physical journey but also mirrors our own search for meaning. It's similar to trying to solve a complex puzzle—it really makes you think about your path.
>>Biblical Scholar: Well, let's talk about how interpreting sacred texts has changed over time. Augustine's emphasis on humility and love in interpreting scripture shaped early Christian thought profoundly.
>>Semiotics Expert: In the realm of signs, um, it's intriguing how symbols like the labyrinth can represent both a journey and a quest for meaning. You know, it reminds me of those times when you're trying to assemble flat-pack furniture—it's like a puzzle that tests your patience and creativity! What does this signify about our own paths?
>>Historian: Actually, the historical evolution of hermeneutics is quite remarkable. Lorenzo Valla's discovery of the Donation of Constantine forgery in 1440 reshaped textual authority through meticulous historical analysis.
>>Literary Critic: Well, it's intriguing how narratives can mirror our own search for meaning. Much like navigating through IKEA—ever tried finding your way out of there? But from a narrative perspective, what does this imply about the stories we tell ourselves?
>>Semiotics Expert (smiling): Speaking of labyrinths, navigating through IKEA really does test your patience!
>>Philosophy Professor (chuckling): Oh yes! It's definitely an experience.
>>Biblical Scholar (smiling): Indeed! Now back to our discussion—you see, the labyrinth as a symbol has been used throughout history to represent both confusion and enlightenment. From a historical perspective...
>>Historian: That's interesting about Augustine's interpretation—how do you think that compares with modern approaches? 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Augustine's emphasis on humility and love as central to interpretation reflects a profound philosophical stance. But, are these virtues universally applicable, or do they reflect a particular cultural narrative?

>>Biblical Scholar: That's an interesting point. Augustine's virtues were indeed shaped by the cultural and philosophical context of his time. How might this influence our interpretations today?

>>Semiotics Expert: I see what you're saying. From a semiotic perspective, these virtues can be seen as symbols that transcend theological interpretation. But could they also represent universal principles guiding human understanding across cultures? What does this signify for our broader comprehension of texts?

>>Historian: Actually, from a historical viewpoint, Augustine's emphasis on humility and love was influenced by the socio-political challenges of his era. This approach wasn't just theological but also deeply rooted in the cultural narratives of the late Roman Empire.

>>Literary Critic: Right, and if we consider Augustine's emphasis on humility and love through a narrative lens, it might reflect the cultural milieu of his time rather than universal truths. What does this imply about our interpretation of texts across different eras?

>>Cultural Anthropologist: You know, I think Augustine's ideas were really shaped by his time. This tells us that our interpretations are influenced by societal contexts. Could it be that our comprehension of texts is deeply rooted in the cultural milieu we find ourselves in?

>>Philosophy Professor: Yet again consider this: while Augustine’s virtues may seem culturally specific, could there be elements within them that suggest some universal relevance? 

>>Biblical Scholar: Indeed! We must understand Augustine’s virtues within the historical tapestry of his era. They were responses to the currents of his time. But how do these insights shape our own interpretations today?

>>Semiotics Expert: In terms of signs, Augustine’s virtues might transcend their original context but what if these symbols aren't universal? Could they instead reflect specific cultural narratives shaping our understanding differently across societies? Fascinating! This implies that our comprehension is deeply influenced by where we come from.

>>Historian: Well actually you see, while Augustine’s virtues were shaped by his time’s narratives, it's worth considering how these narratives evolved over centuries to address different societal challenges.

>>Literary Critic: From a narrative perspective, if we look at how humility and love have been interpreted across different eras, it suggests that these virtues might not be universal truths but rather reflections of specific contexts. 
 >>Cultural Anthropologist: Um, wow! We've covered so much ground today. It's fascinating how interpretation shapes our understanding of texts and traditions across different fields.

>>Philosophy Professor: Absolutely! I think it's really interesting how we've seen hermeneutics at work from biblical texts to cultural rituals. It really shows its importance in our studies.

>>Biblical Scholar: Yes, I agree! Our discussion on Augustine's virtues was particularly enlightening for me. Thanks everyone for your great insights today—looking forward to our next session!"
