Oscars,"

The Academy Awards, commonly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit in film.[1][2] They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) in the United States in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership.[3] The Oscars are widely considered to be the most prestigious awards in the film industry.[4]

The major award categories, known as the Academy Awards of Merit,[5] are presented during a live-televised Hollywood ceremony in February or March. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony.[1] The 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929.[6] The second ceremony, in 1930, was the first one broadcast by radio. The 1953 ceremony was the first one televised.[1] It is the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards. Its counterparts—the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music—are modeled after the Academy Awards.[7] The Oscar statuette depicts a knight, rendered in the Art Deco style.[8]

The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, with an audience of about 270 people.[9]

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.[1] The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (equivalent to $89 in 2023). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors, and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes.

For this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier.[10] For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards.[1] In 1940, the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began. As a result, in 1941 the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.[1]

The term ""Oscar"" is a registered trademark of the AMPAS.

The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. As he had to return to Europe before the ceremony, the Academy agreed to give him the prize early, making him the first Academy Award recipient. For the first Awards, winners were recognized for multiple films during the qualifying period; Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred, and Janet Gaynor won the first Best Actress award for performances in three films. Beginning with the second ceremony, performers received separate nominations for individual films; no performer has received multiple nominations in the same category since the 3rd Academy Awards.

For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period ran from August 1 to July 31. The 6th Academy Awards' eligibility ran from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933, and as of the 7th Academy Awards, subsequent eligibility periods have matched the calendar year (with the exception of the 93rd Academy Awards, which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, extended the eligibility period to February 28, 2021).[1]

Best Foreign Language Film, now known as Best International Feature Film, was introduced at the 20th Academy Awards as a special award, and became a competitive category at the 29th Academy Awards.[11]

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[12]

Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies, except for 2021, have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Traditionally, the previous year's winners for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, while the previous year's winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. In 2009, this model was replaced by each acting award being introduced by five previous winners, each of whom introduces one of the nominated performances, referred to as the ""Fab 5"" presenters format.[13] The Fab 5 model returned in 2024 after a 15-year hiatus.

On February 9, 2020, Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards.[14]

The 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021, was held on April 25, 2021, after it was postponed from its original February 28, 2021, schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. As with the two previous ceremonies, there was no host. The ceremony was broadcast on ABC. It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California for the 19th consecutive year, with satellite locations at Union Station also in Los Angeles.[15] Because of the virus impact on films and TV industries, Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony, streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible.[16] The theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the 95th Academy Awards.[17]

The Oscar statuette, officially the Academy Award of Merit,[18] is given to winners of each year's awards. Made of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34.3 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.9 kg) and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.[19]

Sculptor George Stanley, who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl, sculpted Cedric Gibbons' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy that is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.[18] Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.[20]

The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award statuettes. During the 1970s, the Oscar statues were cast in Crystal Lake, Illinois.[21] From 1983 to 2015,[22] approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens & Company.[23] It would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.[24]

In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to Walden, New York-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, now owned and operated by UAP Urban Art Projects.[25][26] While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal. Cast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn, New York-based Epner Technology. The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months.[27] R.S. Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy, and service existing Oscars that need replating.[28]

The origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed, as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy ""Oscar"".

Margaret Herrick, librarian and president of the Academy, may have said she named it after her supposed uncle Oscar in 1921.[a] The only corroboration was a 1938 clipping from the Los Angeles Examiner, in which Herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase, ""How's your uncle Oscar"".[29]

Bette Davis, in her 1962 autobiography, claimed she named it in 1936 after her first husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson, of whom the statue's rear end reminded her.[29][30] But the term had been in use at least two years before. In a 1974 biography written by Whitney Stine with commentary from Davis, Davis wrote ""I relinquish once and for all any claim that I was the one—so, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the honor is all yours"".[29][31]

Columnist Sidney Skolsky wrote in his 1970 memoir that he came up with the term in 1934 under pressure for a deadline, mocking Vaudeville comedians who asked ""Will you have a cigar, Oscar?"" The Academy credits Skolsky with ""the first confirmed newspaper reference"" to Oscar in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's 6th Academy Awards.[32] But in the newspaper clipping that Skolsky referred to, he wrote that these statues are called 'Oscars', meaning that the name was already in use.[29]

Bruce Davis, a former executive director of the Academy, credited Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary at the Academy when the award was first introduced, for the nickname. She had overseen the pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis credits Lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore's brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar whom the two knew in Chicago, whom Einar described as having always ""stood straight and tall"".[29][33] He asserts credit ""should almost certainly belong to"" Lilleberg.[33]

In 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the probable first public mention of the name ""Oscar"", in journalist Relman Morin's ""Cinematters"" column in the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record on December 5, 1933. Since the awards didn't take place that year, he said: ""What's happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of ""Oscar"", the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this"". This information changes the version of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name.[34]

To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.[35][36]

Before 1950, Oscar statuettes were, and remain, the property of the recipient.[37] Since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the Academy for $1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.[38]

In 1989, Michael Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Best Picture Oscar for his 1956 production of Around the World in 80 Days to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

In 1992, Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to auction to raise money for his wife's medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first Oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992, for $60,500 (equivalent to $131,358 in 2023). Russell defended his action, saying, ""I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't"".[39]

In December 2011, Orson Welles' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.[40] On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for $861,542 (equivalent to $1,166,905 in 2023).[41]

Some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.[38]

In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):[42]

The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting.

From 2004 to 2020, the Academy Award nomination results were announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February. In 2021, the nominees were announced in March. In 2022, the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since 2003.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, is composed of 9,905 voting members as of 2024[update].[43][44]

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. As of 2024[update], actors constitute the largest bloc, numbering 1,258 (12.7% of the voting body).[44] Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and its predecessor Price Waterhouse, since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935.[45][46][47] In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its then-6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013, replacing mailed paper ballots.[48]

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination, or an existing member may submit a name, based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.[49]

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).[50] In 2016, the Academy launched an initiative to expand its membership and increase diversity. In 2024, voting membership stood at 9,905.[44]

According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify, except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories. The film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6 pm and 10 pm local time.[51][52]

For example, the 2009 Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards, as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards. Foreign films must include English subtitles. Each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.[53]

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short-subject awards. It must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print, or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format, with a minimum projector resolution of 2,048 by 1,080 pixels.[54] Since the 90th Academy Awards, presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of O.J.: Made in America, an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN, in that category in 2017. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.[33]

The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and any of the five boroughs of New York City during the previous calendar year,[b] or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list, regardless of any public exhibition or distribution, or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country's official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. A film must have been reviewed by a critic from The New York Times, Time Out New York, the Los Angeles Times, or LA Weekly.[56]

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline. If it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories.

Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering one year starting on October 1, and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in either New York City or Los Angeles County during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution.[56][57]

A film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10 pm local time. For other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.[56][57]

In late December, ballots and lists of eligible films are sent to the membership. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories, i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. A number of branches are only eligible to vote in Best Picture during nomination voting; this includes a producers' branch, as Best Picture is awarded to a film's producer(s), and other branches which have no corresponding award.[44] In all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.[58][59][60] In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

In most categories, the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members.[58][60] Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting.[60][61] Since 2013, re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects.[62]

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.[63] For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner. The Hurt Locker eventually won.

The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars. DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a watermarking fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via Apple TV and Roku players.[64][65] The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.[66]

In 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room. Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform.[67] The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[68] Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.[67]

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men. Fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this. The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the United States to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.[69] The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when ABC took over, televising the festivities, including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966, to 1970. NBC regained the rights for five years (1971–75), then ABC resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.[70]

The Academy has produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets, especially those outside of the Americas, in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. In 1980, the rights were sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the television rights to the Academy Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

In 2004, the ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing television ratings success coinciding with the NCAA division I men's basketball tournament, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. In 1976 and 1977, ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on NBC. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period.[71]

Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.[71] Advertising is somewhat restricted, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. As of 2020, the production of the Academy Awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of Emmys in history, with 54 wins and 280 nominations overall.[72]

After many years of being held on Mondays at 6:00 p.m. Pacific/9:00 pm Eastern, since the 1999 ceremonies, it was moved to Sundays at 5:30 pm PT/8:30 pm ET.[73] The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.[74] For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.[75]

In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing television viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers, as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail. Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with National Football League (NFL) playoff games.[76] In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid-February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.[77] In 2024, the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of 4:00 pm PT/7:00 p.m. ET, the apparent impetus being the ability for ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out program at 7:30 p.m. PT/10:30 p.m. ET.[78]

Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.[79]

In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced,[80] honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.[81] This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a ""popularity contest"" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact. The applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.[82][83] In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed ""the single most hated thing on the show""—overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.[84] In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker.[85]

During the 2018 ceremony, host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become, by announcing that he would give a brand-new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night, a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for Phantom Thread.[86] The Wall Street Journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows: 14 on song performances; 25 on the hosts' speeches; 38 on prerecorded clips; and 78 on the awards themselves, broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement, 24 on winners walking to the stage, and 30 on their acceptance speeches.[87]

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped. The 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, Variety reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.[88] In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC to 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.[89]

Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, the year of Titanic, which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of $600.8 million in the US, a box-office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.[90] The 76th Academy Awards ceremony, in which The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (pre-telecast box office earnings of $368 million) received 11 Awards, including Best Picture, drew 43.56 million viewers.[91] The most-watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date, was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture Midnight Cowboy), which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.[92] Hoping to reinvigorate the pre-show and ratings, the 2023 Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team.[93]

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critical acclaim those films have received. The 78th Academy Awards, which awarded a low-budget independent film (Crash with a pre-Oscar gross of $53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.[94] In 2008, the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.[95] The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (this time, the Coen brothers's No Country for Old Men).

Whereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6 million viewers,[97] the 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4 million,[98] the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974.[99] The 94th and 95th editions drew 16.6 and 18.7 million viewers, respectively, still below the audience of the 92nd edition.[100][101]

The Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the 1949 Oscars, as well as material on many prior ceremonies, along with ancillary material related to more recent shows. Copies are held in a variety of film, video and digital formats.[102]

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.[103]

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre, after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. In 1961, the Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California. In 1969, the Academy moved the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine Auditorium.

In 2002, Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, previously known as the Kodak Theatre, became the presentation's current venue.[104]

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories, Drama and Comedy. At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories, Drama and Comedy/Musical. From the 1930s to the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.[106]
Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals, among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category, that the Academy had announced but did not implement.[107]

The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories. To date, the following categories have been proposed:

The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole. They are not always presented on an annual basis.

Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend around 25 million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the ""Oscar season"".[115] This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing and lobbying than by quality. William Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as ""the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself"".[116]

Tim Dirks, editor of AMC's Filmsite, has written of the Academy Awards:

Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking ""formula-made"" blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.[117]
A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those who were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against Zero Dark Thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that Lincoln distorts history.[118]

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term ""Oscar bait"" was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring ""Oscar bait"" over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.[119]

Despite the success of The Dark Knight, the film did not receive a Best Picture nomination at the 81st Academy Awards. This decision received substantial criticism and was described as a ""snub"" by many publications.[120][121][122] The backlash to the decision was such that, for the 82nd Academy Awards awards in 2010, the Academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as ""The Dark Knight Rule"".[123][124][125][122]

The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.[126][127][128] This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which show that only 6.4% of Academy Award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.[129] For a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of high-profile Oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals, as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters.[130][131] It took until 2023 for an Asian woman to win an Academy Award for Best Actress, when Michelle Yeoh received the award for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. The 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, based on activists' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.[132] In response, the Academy initiated ""historic"" changes in membership by 2020.[133][134] Some media critics claim the Academy's efforts to address its purported racial, gender and national biases are merely distractions.[135][136][137][138] By contrast, the Golden Globe Awards already have multiple winners of Asian descent in leading actress categories.[139] Some question whether the Academy's definition of ""merit"" is just or empowering for non-Americans.[140]

The Academy's Representation and Inclusion Standards have been criticized for excluding Jews as a distinct underrepresented class.[141]

The Academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting, and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress. This has led to situations where a film has two or more co-leads, and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other, and to increase the film's chances of winning. This practice has been derisively called ""category fraud"".[142][143]

For example, Rooney Mara was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Carol (2015), despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to Cate Blanchett, who was nominated for Best Actress. Another example is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), where Brad Pitt was nominated for and won Best Supporting Actor, even though he played an equally important role to Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio. In both these cases, critics argued that The Weinstein Company, the studio behind the former film, had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co-lead.[142][143]

Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,[144] to make up for a ""snub"" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a ""career honor"" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.[145]

Following the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film Roma had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than for typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than for other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.[146]

The United States Department of Justice, having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.[147] Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.[148]

During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head[149] with a G.I. Jane reference. Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face, then returned to his seat and told Rock, twice, to ""Keep my wife's name out [of] your fucking mouth!""[150][151][152] While later accepting the Best Actor award for King Richard, Smith apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock.[153][154][155] Rock decided not to press charges against Smith.[156]

On April 8, 2022, the Academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith had received a ten-year ban from attending the Oscars as a result of the incident.[157]

Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer). Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.[158] Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

George C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for Patton) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony. Scott described it as a ""meat parade"", saying, ""I don't want any part of it"".[159][160][161]

The third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's The Godfather), citing the film industry's discrimination against and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was booing and cheering by the audience.[162][158] In 2022, Littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as Native American.[163][164][165][166][167]

Seven films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony:[168]

One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:

One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:

At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are ""formative experiences as kids who watch them,"" as James put it, ""So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again."" Scott added: ""I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about.""[169] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation enthusiasts and those working in the industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was ""super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure."" The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: ""Animation is cinema.""[170][171] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the Academy for the joke and how Hollywood has treated animation, writing that ""no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them."" They also suggested to the Academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[172]

Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[173] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature Film, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: ""Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.""[174] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision not to broadcast the award.[175]

Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them—The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body, Flee and Memoir of a Snail— having been nominated in this category, with The Boy and the Heron being the first adult animated film (in this case, PG-13-rated) to win in the 96th Academy Awards.[176][177]

These comments came as #NewDeal4Animation, a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay, treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live-action, was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839/SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,[178] and the presentation is being used to rally the movement.

During the 96th Academy Awards in 2024, host Jimmy Kimmel said, ""Please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot."" These remarks would again prompt backlash, with Christopher Miller, producer of that year's nominated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, tweeting out that the joke was ""tired and lazy"".[179] The PG-13-rated The Boy and the Heron would subsequently win the award.

The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards:

It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years, these gifts have been extended to award nominees and winners.[184] The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014, the value was reported to be as high as $80,000.[185] The value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.[186]

Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, videophones, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, weight-loss gummie candy and up to $25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich.[184][187][188][189][190] Some of the gifts have even had a ""risque"" element to them; in 2014, the adult products retailer Adam & Eve had a ""Secret Room Gifting Suite"". Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag, Carolyn Hennesy, Kate Linder, Chris Mulkey, Jim O'Heir and John Salley.[191]

From 2006 onwards, results are Live+SD; all previous years are live viewing.[96]

The awards are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements. Established in 1929, the Oscars are considered the most prestigious awards in the film industry. Key points included the evolution of award categories, such as Best International Feature Film and Best Animated Feature, and changes in eligibility rules over time. The Oscar statuette's design and manufacturing process were discussed, highlighting its Art Deco style and transition from bronze to Britannia metal and back to bronze. The origin of the nickname 'Oscar' remains disputed with multiple claims. The meeting also covered controversies surrounding diversity, category fraud, marketing influence, and criticisms regarding genre preferences. Additionally, it was noted that viewership has fluctuated based on nominated films' box office success. Recent changes include adjustments due to COVID-19 impacts and efforts to increase diversity within AMPAS membership.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief greeting among participants and setting the tone for the meeting\n- Welcome everyone\n- Quick check-in on how everyone is doing\n- Brief overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes"", ""Scene 2: Historical Context of the Oscars\nTLDR: Discussing the history and evolution of the Academy Awards\n- Film Historian shares insights on the origins and early years of the Oscars\n- Discussion on significant changes in award categories over time\n- Participants share personal anecdotes related to Oscar history"", ""Scene 3: The Oscar Statuette Design and Manufacturing Process\nTLDR: Exploring the design, materials, and manufacturing process of the Oscar statuette\n- Film Industry Professional explains the Art Deco style and material transitions\n- Open discussion on participants' thoughts about the statuette design"", ""Scene 4: Controversies Surrounding Diversity and Category Fraud\nTLDR: Addressing controversies related to diversity, category fraud, and marketing influence in the Oscars\n- Media Studies Professor discusses diversity issues within AMPAS membership\n- Film Critic provides examples of category fraud cases and their impact on credibility\n- Public Relations Specialist talks about marketing influence on nominations"", ""Scene 5: Impact of COVID-19 on Recent Changes in Eligibility Rules\nTLDR: Examining how COVID-19 has affected eligibility rules for recent Oscars ceremonies\n- Film Industry Professional outlines specific changes due to pandemic impacts\n- Participants discuss potential long-term effects on future awards"", ""Scene 6: Viewership Trends Based on Nominated Films' Box Office Success\nTLDR: Analyzing how nominated films' box office performance influences viewership trends for the Oscars broadcast \n - Film Critic shares data on viewership fluctuations over recent years \n - Open discussion with participants sharing their perspectives \n - Spontaneous contributions from participants about memorable Oscar moments"", ""Scene 7: Efforts to Increase Diversity Within AMPAS Membership \n TLDR : Discussing initiatives aimed at increasing diversity within AMPAS membership \n - Media Studies Professor highlights key efforts made by AMPAS \n - Public Relations Specialist talks about public perception regarding these efforts \n - Participants share personal experiences or observations related to diversity in film industry"", ""Scene 8 : Open Floor for Unplanned Topics & Personal Experiences Sharing \n TLDR : Allowing space for spontaneous discussions & sharing personal experiences related to Oscars \n - Participants bring up any unplanned topics they wish to discuss \n - Sharing personal stories or experiences connected with Academy Awards"", ""Scene 9 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarizing key points discussed during meeting & outlining next steps moving forward \n - Recap main takeaways from each scene/discussion point covered during meeting \\ n - Outline any action items or follow-up tasks required post-meeting (if applicable)""]",">>Public Relations Specialist: Good morning, everyone! How's everyone doing today? I'm really excited about today's chat. Let's talk about what we want to cover.

>>Film Historian: Morning! I'm doing well, thanks. It's always a pleasure to delve into the rich history of the Oscars since 1929. The historical context is crucial to understanding their significance and impact on both the film industry and society at large.

>>Film Critic: Hey there! I'm good, thanks. From a cinematic perspective, it's fascinating to see how these changes reflect broader shifts in both the film industry and society.

>>Film Industry Professional: Hi everyone! Doing great here. From a production standpoint, we should definitely look at how these changes mirror broader trends in our industry.

>>Media Studies Professor: Hello all! I'm fine, thank you. Considering their cultural significance, it's interesting to explore how these awards shape societal values over time.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Great insights from everyone! Let’s dive deeper into these historical perspectives and see how they connect with today’s trends.

>>Film Enthusiast: Hi all! I'm super excited about this chat. The Oscars are such a big deal every year; I remember watching them with my family when I was a kid—it felt like watching history unfold live! 
 >>Film Historian: Ah, yes, the Oscars have indeed been a significant cultural event since their inception. Back in the day, the first ceremony in 1929 was quite different from what we see today—just a private dinner with about 270 guests at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Can you imagine? It only lasted 15 minutes! As history shows us, the evolution of this event mirrors the growth and changes within the film industry itself.

>>Film Critic: It's fascinating how the Oscars transformed from a brief dinner event to a global spectacle. It's not just about the glitz and glamour; it's also a reflection of how the film industry has evolved over time. For instance, introducing new categories shows how different forms of storytelling gain recognition.

>>Film Industry Professional: Absolutely. From a production standpoint, these new categories weren't just about recognizing different genres; they were also about acknowledging technological innovations and storytelling techniques transforming filmmaking at that time.

>>Media Studies Professor: It's interesting how these changes in categories reflect broader societal shifts too. Animation's growing role in storytelling for both children and adults is one example.

>>Public Relations Specialist: And from a PR perspective, winning an Oscar can significantly boost a film's visibility and box office performance. It's not just about prestige; it's also about leveraging that win in promotional campaigns to attract more audiences.

>>Film Enthusiast: I love seeing new categories being introduced! It really shows how the industry is recognizing different forms of storytelling and innovation. Like when they added Best Visual Effects—it highlighted advancements in film technology.

>>Film Historian: Indeed, back in the day there were categories like Best Dance Direction from 1935 to 1937 which highlighted choreography's importance in films at that time. These changes mark technological advancements but also shifts in cultural values and artistic priorities.

>>Film Critic: Right! Categories like Best Dance Direction highlight how different forms of storytelling gain recognition over time. It's better than sticking to traditional categories forever.

>>Film Historian: You know what's interesting? The Oscars have also been platforms for social and political statements. Marlon Brando's refusal of his Best Actor award in 1973 to protest Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans was significant. These instances reflect broader societal issues and movements of their times.

>>Media Studies Professor: As a professor, I find it fascinating that Hattie McDaniel's win in 1940 as the first African American Oscar recipient was monumental yet bittersweet since she had to sit at a segregated table during the ceremony. Moments like these reflect not just cinematic achievements but prevailing social dynamics too.

>>Film Industry Professional: Exactly! And again, from our side—the introduction of categories like Best Visual Effects showcases advancements in film technology celebrated within our industry.

>>Public Relations Specialist: And let's not forget that even nominations can elevate a film’s profile significantly—like having a golden ticket to increased media coverage!

>>Film Enthusiast: Honestly? Watching moments like Marlon Brando refusing his award blew me away as they showed Oscars are more than awards—they're reflections of society! 
 >>Film Industry Professional: The Oscar statuette has gone through some changes over the years, like switching materials due to availability and tech advancements. It's not just an award; it's a symbol of excellence that has evolved with the times.

>>Film Historian: As mentioned earlier, during World War II, they used painted plaster due to metal shortages. This adaptation is a testament to Hollywood's resilience. The Art Deco style was quite popular back in the day and it perfectly encapsulates the glamour and elegance of Hollywood's Golden Age.

>>Media Studies Professor: Building on that point, it's interesting how such adaptations also reflect broader societal values at the time. From an academic standpoint, these transitions mirror economic and social shifts. For instance, using painted plaster during World War II highlights how global events impact even prestigious awards.

>>Public Relations Specialist: From a PR angle, it's amazing how they've kept the Oscar's iconic look while adapting to different challenges. Its design and historical significance make it a powerful marketing tool that resonates globally.

>>Film Critic: I agree with what was said about the Art Deco style capturing timeless elegance. But do you think any modern designs could ever replace it? Even during material shortages like in World War II, using painted plaster instead of metal shows their commitment to maintaining this symbol's prestige.

>>Film Enthusiast: That's a great question! I personally think the Oscar statuette's design is amazing because it represents so much history and prestige. Even during tough times like World War II, they found a way to keep tradition alive with painted plaster. What do you all think about updating its design?

>>Film Historian: You know, it's not just about preserving cultural significance but also about Hollywood's resilience. The Art Deco style continues to evoke glamour even today. However, I'm open to seeing how modern elements could be incorporated without losing its essence.

>>Media Studies Professor: From a cultural perspective, these material transitions are emblematic of Hollywood's adaptability. These changes reflect not only technological advancements but also societal values and historical contexts.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Absolutely! And maintaining that iconic image through various challenges speaks volumes about their branding strategy too. But maybe introducing subtle updates could help keep it relevant for newer generations while honoring its legacy.

>>Film Industry Professional: Right! And from production angles too...the shift back to bronze recently reflects both tradition nods while embracing modern techniques ensuring sustainability without compromising on quality or symbolism attached with Oscars! 
 >>Media Studies Professor: Um, considering the ongoing discussions about diversity within AMPAS, it's crucial to recognize that the lack of representation among its members has a big impact. You know, from a cultural perspective, this homogeneity can lead to a narrow scope of films being celebrated, often sidelining stories from marginalized communities. As we see in media studies, the narratives that receive recognition shape societal values and perceptions.

>>Film Critic: Well, misclassification is a significant issue that really undermines the credibility of the Oscars. Take Alicia Vikander in 'The Danish Girl' or Mahershala Ali in 'Green Book'—both were clearly leads but campaigned as supporting to avoid competition. This kind of manipulation skews the awards and diminishes their value.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Actually, from a PR perspective, the influence of marketing on Oscar nominations can't be overstated. Studios invest millions in campaigns to sway voters, creating narratives that can sometimes overshadow the actual merit of the films. This strategic positioning often leads to misclassification like with Vikander and Ali, which ultimately skews public perception of what these awards truly represent.

>>Film Historian: As history shows us, um, the Oscars have always been a reflection of societal values and industry trends. The issue of misclassification—

>>Film Industry Professional (interrupting): Sorry to interrupt! Just wanted to add quickly—this isn't just about actors; it affects directors and writers too. Okay, please continue.

>>Film Historian: No problem! So as I was saying earlier, studios have historically manipulated categories to improve their chances. This practice not only skews the awards but also distorts our understanding of cinematic excellence. How can we ensure that these awards maintain their integrity in such a competitive environment?

>>Film Industry Professional: From a production standpoint, you know, this issue is particularly troubling. Studios often strategize to maximize their chances by placing actors in less competitive categories, which can distort the true merit of performances. This manipulation not only affects the integrity of the awards but also impacts how audiences perceive these achievements.

>>Public Relations Specialist (overlapping): And don't forget how this impacts marketing strategies! For instance, when studios push for certain nominations based on marketability rather than merit.

>>Film Historian: Right! Back then studios would manipulate categories to ensure their films had better chances at winning. This practice not only distorts our understanding but also undermines award integrity itself. 
 >>Film Industry Professional: So, the pandemic really forced us to rethink eligibility rules. Allowing streaming-only releases was a game-changer. It kept the industry afloat and opened doors for films that might have been overlooked otherwise.

>>Film Critic: Yeah, it was necessary during the pandemic, but I worry it's diluted the prestige of the Oscars. Films that would never have made it to theaters are now in contention. This could lead to a long-term shift where theatrical releases might lose their significance.

>>Media Studies Professor: True, but this shift has also democratized access to films. It's allowed for a more diverse range of voices and stories to be recognized by the Academy. But how do we balance that with maintaining traditional values?

>>Film Historian: You know, history shows us that the Academy has always adapted to societal changes and technological advancements. The introduction of streaming-only releases is reminiscent of past shifts like the transition from silent films to talkies or color films.

>>Film Critic: Sure, but let's not kid ourselves. The Oscars' prestige is built on theatrical experiences. Allowing films that bypass theaters entirely could erode what makes an Oscar-winning film special.

>>Public Relations Specialist: From a PR perspective, this shift was strategic—it kept the industry alive and expanded our marketing reach globally through digital campaigns. But will this broadened access redefine what we consider Oscar-worthy in the long run?

>>Film Industry Professional: Basically, from a production standpoint, it wasn't just about survival during the pandemic. It fundamentally altered how we approach distribution and marketing strategies. Reaching global audiences instantly is something theatrical releases can't always achieve.

>>Media Studies Professor: Right! And from an academic standpoint, this change raises questions about how we value different modes of film consumption and their impact on societal values.

>>Film Enthusiast: Yeah! I mean, as a fan, it's been great having access to so many films online that I wouldn't have seen otherwise! But do you think it'll stick around? Like permanently?

>>Film Historian: Back in the day, similar challenges arose with television's advent. The shift to streaming-only releases is just another chapter in this ongoing evolution.

>>Film Critic: Honestly? This change could lead to a permanent redefinition of Oscars' prestige if we're not careful about maintaining standards between theatrical and streaming platforms. 
 >>Film Historian: You know, it's fascinating to consider how the Oscars have evolved in response to societal changes. Historically speaking, films like 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Ben-Hur' not only dominated at the box office but also captivated Oscar audiences.

>>Film Industry Professional: Yeah, when big movies like 'Titanic' or 'Avatar' are nominated, more people tune in because they've already seen these films. It's like they want to see if their favorites win.

>>Film Critic: Exactly! If we look at data from the past decade, there's a clear correlation between box office hits and Oscar viewership spikes. Remember 2010 when 'Avatar' was nominated? Viewership jumped to over 41 million. But in years with less commercially successful nominees, there's a significant drop.

>>Media Studies Professor: And it's not just about numbers. Blockbuster films shape societal narratives too. Like when 'Black Panther' was nominated—it resonated with a broader audience due to its cultural impact and representation.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Totally! From a PR perspective, leveraging the success of these blockbusters is crucial for our marketing strategies. We can create campaigns that highlight their cultural impact and broad appeal to draw in viewers who might not typically watch the Oscars.

>>Film Enthusiast: I think it's amazing how films like 'Black Panther' and 'Avatar' can draw such diverse audiences! Honestly, as a fan, seeing these blockbusters get nominated makes the Oscars so much more exciting to watch. Do you guys remember all the buzz around 'Titanic'? It was incredible!

>>Media Studies Professor: And moments like when ‘Parasite’ won Best Picture really challenge Hollywood's traditional boundaries and resonate globally. How do you think such moments influence broader cultural landscapes?

>>Public Relations Specialist: Yeah! And creating buzz around blockbuster nominations taps into existing enthusiasm among fans which amplifies through strategic campaigns.

>>Film Enthusiast: Honestly? The Oscars are at their best when they reflect what people actually love watching! Like remember everyone talking about ‘La La Land’ vs ‘Moonlight’? That mix-up moment got everyone buzzing again!

>>Film Historian: I see your point about blockbusters drawing viewers, but don't you think smaller indie films bring unique value to the Oscars too? They often offer fresh perspectives that big-budget movies might miss.

>>Film Critic: Absolutely! Indie films can surprise us with their storytelling and creativity. They may not have huge budgets or massive followings initially, but they often leave a lasting impression on both critics and audiences alike. 
 >>Media Studies Professor: Considering the efforts made by AMPAS to increase diversity within its membership, it's crucial to recognize how these initiatives reflect broader societal shifts. Diversifying the Academy's voting body can lead to a more inclusive representation of films that resonate with various communities. This not only enriches the cinematic landscape but also ensures that different voices and stories are acknowledged and celebrated.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Absolutely, and from a PR perspective, these diversity initiatives are essential for public perception. They enhance the Academy's image and align with societal values of inclusivity and representation. When people see genuine efforts towards diversity, it builds trust and engagement with the Oscars.

>>Film Critic: I agree these initiatives are important, but we need to look at their actual impact. Are they really leading to more diverse nominations and winners? For example, last year we saw ""Parasite"" win Best Picture, which was a significant moment. But is this becoming a trend or just an exception?

>>Film Historian: Historically speaking, the Academy used to be quite homogenous, which limited the range of films being recognized. These recent efforts by AMPAS are about ensuring that the Oscars remain relevant and reflective of our evolving cultural landscape. It's not just about inclusivity; it's about celebrating all forms of art equally.

>>Film Enthusiast: As a fan, it's exciting to see more representation in nominated films! But do you think this will actually lead to more diverse winners? Or is it just a step in the right direction?

>>Film Industry Professional: In my experience working on films, these diversity initiatives have real implications for what gets produced. When decision-makers are diverse, it opens up opportunities for projects that might otherwise be overlooked. This can lead to a richer cinematic landscape overall.

>>Media Studies Professor: From an academic standpoint, it's essential to consider how these initiatives foster a cultural shift beyond just numbers. By diversifying the Academy's membership, we pave the way for a broader spectrum of narratives and perspectives to be recognized.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Exactly! And in PR terms, these changes help build credibility for AMPAS among audiences who value inclusivity. It's crucial for maintaining relevance today when people expect institutions like AMPAS to reflect modern values.

>>Film Critic: We definitely need data here. Are we seeing significant increases in nominations and wins for underrepresented groups? Or is this another case of tokenism? For instance, has there been an increase in nominations for female directors or filmmakers of color?

>>Film Historian: If we look back at history again briefly—past criticisms were largely due to certain voices not being heard enough at platforms like the Oscars. These current efforts should ideally celebrate all forms of art without bias. 
 >>Film Enthusiast: You know, one of my favorite Oscar moments was when 'La La Land' was mistakenly announced as Best Picture instead of 'Moonlight.' It was such a chaotic and unforgettable moment! As a fan, it really showed how unpredictable and exciting the Oscars can be.

>>Film Critic: Yeah, that mix-up is definitely one for the history books. But it's interesting how these mistakes can sometimes overshadow the films themselves. The drama of the Oscars becomes part of film history too.

>>Film Historian: Back in the day, the Oscars were much more intimate. The first ceremony in 1929 was held at a private dinner with just about 270 guests. It's fascinating to see how it has evolved into this grand spectacle we have today. Do you think this shift has changed its cultural significance?

>>Media Studies Professor: Definitely! Moments like that mix-up become part of our collective memory. They highlight not just the unpredictability of live events but also shape our perception of cinematic achievements. Do you think these moments add to the allure and mystique of the Oscars?

>>Film Industry Professional: One of my most memorable Oscar moments was working on 'The King's Speech' campaign. It wasn't just about making a great movie; it was about ensuring it got seen by the right people at the right time. Seeing it win Best Picture made all that hard work worth it.

>>Film Enthusiast: Honestly, one of my top Oscar moments has to be when 'Parasite' won Best Picture. As a fan, it was amazing to see a foreign-language film break barriers and win such a prestigious award! It really showed how much the Academy is evolving.

>>Film Critic: When 'Moonlight' won after that mix-up with 'La La Land,' it wasn't just about winning an award; it represented significant progress in terms of representation in cinema. These moments highlight whose stories get told and celebrated.

>>Public Relations Specialist: From a PR standpoint, those unexpected moments are goldmines for media coverage and public interest. They keep people talking about the Oscars long after they've ended and help maintain their relevance in popular culture.

>>Media Studies Professor: Absolutely! And from an academic perspective, it's fascinating to consider how these milestones influence mainstream cinema's storytelling trends. When 'Parasite' won Best Picture, it challenged Hollywood's traditional boundaries and opened up new dialogues about global cinema.

>>Film Historian: Like I mentioned earlier, the first Oscar ceremony was so different from what we have now. The shift from an exclusive event to this massive global broadcast has certainly changed its cultural significance over time.

>>Film Industry Professional: Right! And coordinating something on that scale is no small feat either. The logistics behind campaigns are intense but incredibly rewarding when everything comes together perfectly. 
 >>Media Studies Professor: Considering the various perspectives we've discussed, it's clear that the Oscars not only reflect but also shape societal values and trends. From a cultural perspective, we see how these awards influence what stories are told and celebrated in cinema. Going forward, we should turn these ideas into real actions for greater inclusivity and representation in all facets of filmmaking.

>>Film Historian: I agree with what you said about inclusivity, Professor. To add to that, it's evident that the Oscars have evolved significantly since their inception in 1929. From the historical context of the awards' origins to the impact of societal changes on categories and nominations, we've seen how these shifts mirror broader cultural trends. Maybe we could look at some successful case studies where inclusivity has been effectively implemented.

>>Film Industry Professional: From a production standpoint, addressing the logistical challenges and opportunities we've discussed is crucial. For instance, um, the shift to streaming-only releases during the pandemic has opened new avenues for film distribution but also raised concerns about maintaining the Oscars' prestige. How do you think we can balance these innovations with traditional practices?

>>Public Relations Specialist: That's a great point about streaming releases. Leveraging these insights into actionable marketing strategies is key from a PR perspective. Promoting both the Oscars' historical significance and their modern relevance can enhance public engagement and viewership. Let's focus on creating campaigns that highlight both tradition and innovation.

>>Film Critic: Well, from a cinematic perspective, it's clear that the Oscars have always been a reflection of broader societal trends. We've discussed how historical events and technological advancements have shaped the awards over time. We should definitely look at specific strategies to ensure our insights lead to more diversity in filmmaking.

>>Film Enthusiast: As a fan, I love seeing how much history there is behind every Oscar moment! But it's also crucial that we push for diversity in all aspects of filmmaking—maybe we could look at some recent films that have done this well?

>>Media Studies Professor: Absolutely! And let's not forget how these moments shape collective memory and influence cinema trends overall.

>>Film Historian: Exactly! The evolution from an intimate event in 1929 to today's grand spectacle shows just how much has changed—and yet some things remain constant like celebrating excellence in film.

>>Film Industry Professional: To put it simply, balancing traditional practices with new innovations needs practical solutions. This means addressing streaming releases while maintaining theatrical experiences' prestige. We should set up a task force to address these logistical challenges effectively moving forward.

>>Public Relations Specialist: Right! And by highlighting both tradition and innovation in our campaigns, we can keep audiences engaged while promoting inclusivity."
