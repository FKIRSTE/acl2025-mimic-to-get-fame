Pragmatism,"

Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that views language and thought as tools for prediction, problem solving, and action, rather than describing, representing, or mirroring reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.

Pragmatism began in the United States in the 1870s. Its origins are often attributed to philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. In 1878, Peirce described it in his pragmatic maxim: ""Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object.""[1]

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the United States around 1870.[2] Charles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) is given credit for its development,[3] 
along with later 20th-century contributors, William James and John Dewey.[4] Its direction was determined by The Metaphysical Club members Peirce, Dewey, James, Chauncey Wright and George Herbert Mead.

The word pragmatic has existed in English since the 1500s, borrowed from French and derived from Greek via Latin. The Greek word pragma, meaning business, deed or act, is a noun derived from the verb prassein, to do.[5]
The first use in print of the name pragmatism was in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s.[6] James regarded Peirce's ""Illustrations of the Logic of Science"" series—including ""The Fixation of Belief"" (1877), and especially ""How to Make Our Ideas Clear"" (1878)—as the foundation of pragmatism.[7][8] 
Peirce in turn wrote in 1906[9] that Nicholas St. John Green had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying Alexander Bain's definition of belief, which was ""that upon which a man is prepared to act"". Peirce wrote that ""from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism"". John Shook has said, ""Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation.""[10]

Peirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt,[11] and said that, in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way, ""Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object"",[1] which he later called the pragmatic maxim. It equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object's effects. This is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, although he was a mathematical logician and a founder of statistics.[citation needed]

Peirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. While framing a conception's meaning in terms of conceivable tests, Peirce emphasized that, since a conception is general, its meaning, its intellectual purport, equates to its acceptance's implications for general practice, rather than to any definite set of real effects (or test results); a conception's clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications, but the outcomes are not meanings, but individual upshots. Peirce in 1905 coined the new name pragmaticism ""for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition"",[12] saying that ""all went happily"" with James's and F. C. S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name ""pragmatism"" and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in ""literary journals, where it gets abused"". Yet in a 1906 manuscript, he cited as causes his differences with James and Schiller[13] and, in a 1908 publication,[14] his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini. Peirce regarded his own views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them about the falsity of necessitarianism and about the reality of generals and habits understood in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized.[14]

Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars used a revised pragmatism to criticize logical positivism in the 1960s. Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through Richard Rorty, the most influential of the late 20th century pragmatists along with Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom. Contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a ""neo-classical"" pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.[citation needed]

A few of the various but often interrelated positions characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:

Dewey in The Quest for Certainty criticized what he called ""the philosophical fallacy"": Philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted because they don't realize that these are nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems.[15] This causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion. Various examples are the ""ultimate Being"" of Hegelian philosophers, the belief in a ""realm of value"", the idea that logic, because it is an abstraction from concrete thought, has nothing to do with the action of concrete thinking.

David L. Hildebrand summarized the problem: ""Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience.""[15]: 40 

From the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with the scientific method as they understood it. They argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp. They held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to correspondence theories of knowledge and truth.[citation needed] Pragmatists criticized the former for its a priorism, and the latter because it takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between knower and known.

In 1868,[16] C.S. Peirce argued that there is no power of intuition in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since Descartes. He argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around.[17] At the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science:[18] what we do think is too different from what we should think; in his ""Illustrations of the Logic of Science"" series, Peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general.[19] This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism.

Richard Rorty expanded on these and other arguments in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to—and sometimes thought of as superior to—the empirical sciences. W.V. Quine, who was instrumental in bringing naturalized epistemology back into favor with his essay ""Epistemology Naturalized"",[20] also criticized ""traditional"" epistemology and its ""Cartesian dream"" of absolute certainty. The dream, he argued, was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory, because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry.

Hilary Putnam has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism[24] and fallibilism is the central goal of American pragmatism.[21][22][23] Although all human knowledge is partial, with no ability to take a ""God's-eye-view"", this does not necessitate a globalized skeptical attitude, a radical philosophical skepticism (as distinguished from that which is called scientific skepticism). Peirce insisted that (1) in reasoning, there is the presupposition, and at least the hope,[25] that truth and the real are discoverable and would be discovered, sooner or later but still inevitably, by investigation taken far enough,[1] and (2) contrary to Descartes's famous and influential methodology in the Meditations on First Philosophy, doubt cannot be feigned or created by verbal fiat to motivate fruitful inquiry, and much less can philosophy begin in universal doubt.[26] Doubt, like belief, requires justification. Genuine doubt irritates and inhibits, in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act.[1] It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a ""situation""), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition.

Pragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge: Schopenhauer advocated a biological idealism as what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an ""ecological"" account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. Real and true are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context. It is not realist in a traditionally robust sense of realism (what Hilary Putnam later called metaphysical realism), but it is realist in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with.[citation needed]

Many of James' best-turned phrases—""truth's cash value""[27] and ""the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking"" [28]—were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true. William James wrote:

It is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the truth is that which ""works."" Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives ""satisfaction""! He is treated as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant.[29]
In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle.[nb 1]

The role of belief in representing reality is widely debated in pragmatism. Is a belief valid when it represents reality? ""Copying is one (and only one) genuine mode of knowing"".[30] Are beliefs dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action? Is it only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning? Does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle? In James's pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be necessarily true nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term. For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).

While pragmatism started simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field. Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.

In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality. Instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth does not matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.

One of C. I. Lewis' main arguments in Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge (1929) was that science does not merely provide a copy of reality but must work with conceptual systems and that those are chosen for pragmatic reasons, that is, because they aid inquiry. Lewis' own development of multiple modal logics is a case in point. Lewis is sometimes called a proponent of conceptual pragmatism because of this.[31]

Another development is the cooperation of logical positivism and pragmatism in the works of Charles W. Morris and Rudolf Carnap. The influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the pragmatic maxim into their epistemology. Pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement do not often refer to them.

W. V. Quine's paper ""Two Dogmas of Empiricism"", published in 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of 20th-century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic statements (tautologies and contradictions) whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement ('all bachelors are unmarried'), and synthetic statements, whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of (contingent) states of affairs. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience. Quine's argument brings to mind Peirce's insistence that axioms are not a priori truths but synthetic statements.

Later in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook, Formal Logic. By then, Schiller's pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy. Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context. The least famous of Schiller's main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book Formal Logic. In this sequel, Logic for Use, Schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in Formal Logic. What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.

Whereas Schiller dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others—or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one set of tools among others. This is the view of C. I. Lewis. C. S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic.

Stephen Toulmin's The Uses of Argument inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies (although it is an epistemological work).

James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained. They were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because, in the tradition dating from Hume, empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations. To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality. Radical empiricism, or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey's words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms.

William James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming:

[A young graduate] began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic classroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it. ... In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it ... It is no explanation of our concrete universe[32]
F. C. S. Schiller's first book Riddles of the Sphinx was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics. These opposites are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism. Schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the ""higher"" aspects of our world. These include free will, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God. On the other hand, abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the ""lower"" aspects of our world (e.g. the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry, but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation.

In the second half of the 20th century, Stephen Toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what ""ultimate reality"" consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett, who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the ""syntactical"" aspects of reality (i.e., whizzing atoms) and its emergent or ""semantic"" properties (i.e., meaning and value).[citation needed]

Radical empiricism gives answers to questions about the limits of science, the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism. These questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between religion and science, where it is often assumed—most pragmatists would disagree—that science degrades everything that is meaningful into ""merely"" physical phenomena.

Both John Dewey in Experience and Nature (1929) and, half a century later, Richard Rorty in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions. They argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category.

Pragmatists disagree over whether philosophers ought to adopt a quietist or a naturalist stance toward the mind-body problem. The former, including Rorty, want to do away with the problem because they believe it's a pseudo-problem, whereas the latter believe that it is a meaningful empirical question. [citation needed]

Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values. Pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans. Good values are those for which we have good reasons, viz. the good reasons approach. The pragmatist formulation pre-dates those of other philosophers who have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as Jerome Schneewind and John Searle.

William James' contribution to ethics, as laid out in his essay The Will to Believe has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationality. On its own terms it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait for adequate proof when making moral decisions.

Moral questions immediately present themselves as questions whose solution cannot wait for sensible proof. A moral question is a question not of what sensibly exists, but of what is good, or would be good if it did exist. ... A social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is because each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will simultaneously do theirs. Wherever a desired result is achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of those immediately concerned. A government, an army, a commercial system, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on this condition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is even attempted.[33]
Of the classical pragmatists, John Dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy.[34] In his classic article ""Three Independent Factors in Morals"",[35] he tried to integrate three basic philosophical perspectives on morality: the right, the virtuous and the good. He held that while all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions, the possibility of conflict among the three elements cannot always be easily solved.[36]

Dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education, both conceived as merely a means to an end. He stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education that viewed it not as a preparation for life but as life itself.[37]

Dewey was opposed to other ethical philosophies of his time, notably the emotivism of Alfred Ayer. Dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline, and thought values could best be characterized not as feelings or imperatives, but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed consummatory experience. An additional implication of this view is that ethics is a fallible undertaking because human beings are frequently unable to know what would satisfy them.

During the late 1900s and first decade of 2000, pragmatism was embraced by many in the field of bioethics led by the philosophers John Lachs and his student Glenn McGee, whose 1997 book The Perfect Baby: A Pragmatic Approach to Genetic Engineering (see designer baby) garnered praise from within classical American philosophy and criticism from bioethics for its development of a theory of pragmatic bioethics and its rejection of the principalism theory then in vogue in medical ethics. An anthology published by the MIT Press titled Pragmatic Bioethics included the responses of philosophers to that debate, including Micah Hester, Griffin Trotter and others many of whom developed their own theories based on the work of Dewey, Peirce, Royce and others. Lachs developed several applications of pragmatism to bioethics independent of but extending from the work of Dewey and James.

A recent pragmatist contribution to meta-ethics is Todd Lekan's Making Morality.[38] Lekan argues that morality is a fallible but rational practice and that it has traditionally been misconceived as based on theory or principles. Instead, he argues, theory and rules arise as tools to make practice more intelligent.

John Dewey's Art as Experience, based on the William James lectures he delivered at Harvard University, was an attempt to show the integrity of art, culture and everyday experience (IEP). Art, for Dewey, is or should be a part of everyone's creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists. He also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient. Dewey's treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of Immanuel Kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation. A notable contemporary pragmatist aesthetician is Joseph Margolis. He defines a work of art as ""a physically embodied, culturally emergent entity"", a human ""utterance"" that isn't an ontological quirk but in line with other human activity and culture in general. He emphasizes that works of art are complex and difficult to fathom, and that no determinate interpretation can be given.

Both Dewey and James investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society, the former in A Common Faith and the latter in The Varieties of Religious Experience.

From a general point of view, for William James, something is true only insofar as it works. Thus, the statement, for example, that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but (a) may not help to bring about the things you pray for (b) may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are heard. As such, pragmatism is not antithetical to religion but it is not an apologetic for faith either. James' metaphysical position however, leaves open the possibility that the ontological claims of religions may be true. As he observed in the end of the Varieties, his position does not amount to a denial of the existence of transcendent realities. Quite the contrary, he argued for the legitimate epistemic right to believe in such realities, since such beliefs do make a difference in an individual's life and refer to claims that cannot be verified or falsified either on intellectual or common sensorial grounds.

Joseph Margolis in Historied Thought, Constructed World (California, 1995) makes a distinction between ""existence"" and ""reality"". He suggests using the term ""exists"" only for those things which adequately exhibit Peirce's Secondness: things which offer brute physical resistance to our movements. In this way, such things which affect us, like numbers, may be said to be ""real"", although they do not ""exist"". Margolis suggests that God, in such a linguistic usage, might very well be ""real"", causing believers to act in such and such a way, but might not ""exist"".

Pragmatic pedagogy is an educational philosophy that emphasizes teaching students knowledge that is practical for life and encourages them to grow into better people. American philosopher John Dewey is considered one of the main thinkers of the pragmatist educational approach.

Neopragmatism is a broad contemporary category used for various thinkers that incorporate important insights of, and yet significantly diverge from, the classical pragmatists. This divergence may occur either in their philosophical methodology (many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition) or in conceptual formation: for example, conceptual pragmatist C. I. Lewis was very critical of Dewey; neopragmatist Richard Rorty disliked Peirce.

Important analytic pragmatists include early Richard Rorty (who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979),[39] Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. Brazilian social thinker Roberto Unger advocates for a radical pragmatism, one that ""de-naturalizes"" society and culture, and thus insists that we can ""transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change, little by little, the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them"".[40] Late Rorty and Jürgen Habermas are closer to Continental thought.

Neopragmatist thinkers who are more loyal to classical pragmatism include Sidney Hook and Susan Haack (known for the theory of foundherentism). Many pragmatist ideas (especially those of Peirce) find a natural expression in the decision-theoretic reconstruction of epistemology pursued in the work of Isaac Levi. Nicholas Rescher advocated his version of methodological pragmatism, based on construing pragmatic efficacy not as a replacement for truths but as a means to its evidentiation.[41] Rescher was also a proponent of pragmatic idealism.

Not all pragmatists are easily characterized. With the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of Anglo-American philosophy, many philosophers were influenced by pragmatist thought without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school. Daniel Dennett, a student of Quine's, falls into this category, as does Stephen Toulmin, who arrived at his philosophical position via Wittgenstein, whom he calls ""a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind"".[42] Another example is Mark Johnson whose embodied philosophy[43] shares its psychologism, direct realism and anti-cartesianism with pragmatism. Conceptual pragmatism is a theory of knowledge originating with the work of the philosopher and logician Clarence Irving Lewis. The epistemology of conceptual pragmatism was first formulated in the 1929 book Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge.

French pragmatism is attended with theorists such as Michel Callon, Bruno Latour, Michel Crozier, Luc Boltanski, and Laurent Thévenot. It often is seen as opposed to structural problems connected to the French critical theory of Pierre Bourdieu. French pragmatism has more recently made inroads into American sociology and anthropology as well.[44][45][46]

Philosophers John R. Shook and Tibor Solymosi said that ""each new generation rediscovers and reinvents its own versions of pragmatism by applying the best available practical and scientific methods to philosophical problems of contemporary concern"".[47]

In the 20th century, the movements of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy have similarities with pragmatism. Like pragmatism, logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics; however, logical positivism doesn't stress action as pragmatism does. The pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense. Usually, pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection.

Ordinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character (although Peirce's pragmatism is not nominalist[14]) and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world.

Pragmatism has ties to process philosophy. Much of the classical pragmatists' work developed in dialogue with process philosophers such as Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, who aren't usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points.[48] Nonetheless, philosopher Donovan Irven argues there's a strong connection between Henri Bergson, pragmatist William James, and the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre regarding their theories of truth.[49]

Behaviorism and functionalism in psychology and sociology also have ties to pragmatism, which is not surprising considering that James and Dewey were both scholars of psychology and that Mead became a sociologist.

Pragmatism emphasizes the connection between thought and action. Applied fields like public administration,[50] political science,[51] leadership studies,[52] international relations,[53] conflict resolution,[54] and research methodology[55] have incorporated the tenets of pragmatism in their field. Often this connection is made using Dewey and Addams's expansive notion of democracy.

In the early 20th century, Symbolic interactionism, a major perspective within sociological social psychology, was derived from pragmatism, especially the work of George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, as well as that of Peirce and William James.[56][57]

Increasing attention is being given to pragmatist epistemology in other branches of the social sciences, which have struggled with divisive debates over the status of social scientific knowledge.[4][58]

Enthusiasts suggest that pragmatism offers an approach that is both pluralist and practical.[59]

The classical pragmatism of John Dewey, William James, and Charles Sanders Peirce has influenced research in the field of public administration. Scholars claim classical pragmatism had a profound influence on the origin of the field of public administration.[60][61] At the most basic level, public administrators are responsible for making programs ""work"" in a pluralistic, problems-oriented environment. Public administrators are also responsible for the day-to-day work with citizens. Dewey's participatory democracy can be applied in this environment. Dewey and James' notion of theory as a tool, helps administrators craft theories to resolve policy and administrative problems. Further, the birth of American public administration coincides closely with the period of greatest influence of the classical pragmatists.

Which pragmatism (classical pragmatism or neo-pragmatism) makes the most sense in public administration has been the source of debate. The debate began when Patricia M. Shields introduced Dewey's notion of the Community of Inquiry.[62] Hugh Miller objected to one element of the community of inquiry (problematic situation, scientific attitude, participatory democracy): scientific attitude.[63] A debate that included responses from a practitioner,[64] an economist,[65] a planner,[66] other public administration scholars,[67][68] and noted philosophers[69][70] followed. Miller[71] and Shields[72][73] also responded.

In addition, applied scholarship of public administration that assesses charter schools,[74] contracting out or outsourcing,[75] financial management,[76] performance measurement,[77] urban quality of life initiatives,[78] and urban planning[79] in part draws on the ideas of classical pragmatism in the development of the conceptual framework and focus of analysis.[80][81][82]

The health sector's administrators' use of pragmatism has been criticized as incomplete in its pragmatism, however,[83] according to the classical pragmatists, knowledge is always shaped by human interests. The administrator's focus on ""outcomes"" simply advances their own interest, and this focus on outcomes often undermines their citizen's interests, which often are more concerned with process. On the other hand, David Brendel argues that pragmatism's ability to bridge dualisms, focus on practical problems, include multiple perspectives, incorporate participation from interested parties (patient, family, health team), and provisional nature makes it well suited to address problems in this area.[84]

Since the mid 1990s, feminist philosophers have re-discovered classical pragmatism as a source of feminist theories. Works by Seigfried,[85] Duran,[86] Keith,[87] and Whipps[88] explore the historic and philosophic links between feminism and pragmatism. The connection between pragmatism and feminism took so long to be rediscovered because pragmatism itself was eclipsed by logical positivism during the middle decades of the twentieth century. As a result, it was lost from feminist discourse. Feminists now consider pragmatism's greatest strength to be the very features that led to its decline. These are ""persistent and early criticisms of positivist interpretations of scientific methodology; disclosure of value dimension of factual claims""; viewing aesthetics as informing everyday experience; subordinating logical analysis to political, cultural, and social issues; linking the dominant discourses with domination; ""realigning theory with praxis; and resisting the turn to epistemology and instead emphasizing concrete experience"".[89]

Feminist philosophers point to Jane Addams as a founder of classical pragmatism. Mary Parker Follett was also an important feminist pragmatist concerned with organizational operation during the early decades of the 20th century.[90][91] In addition, the ideas of Dewey, Mead, and James are consistent with many feminist tenets. Jane Addams, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead developed their philosophies as all three became friends, influenced each other, and were engaged in the Hull House experience and women's rights causes.

In the 1908 essay ""The Thirteen Pragmatisms"", Arthur Oncken Lovejoy argued that there's significant ambiguity in the notion of the effects of the truth of a proposition and those of belief in a proposition in order to highlight that many pragmatists had failed to recognize that distinction.[92] He identified 13 different philosophical positions that were each labeled pragmatism.[92]

The Franciscan friar Celestine Bittle presented multiple criticisms of pragmatism in his 1936 book Reality and the Mind: Epistemology.[93] He argued that, in William James's pragmatism, truth is entirely subjective and is not the widely accepted definition of truth, which is correspondence to reality. For Bittle, defining truth as what is useful is a ""perversion of language"".[93] With truth reduced essentially to what is good, it is no longer an object of the intellect. Therefore, the problem of knowledge posed by the intellect is not solved, but rather renamed. Renaming truth as a product of the will cannot help it solve the problems of the intellect, according to Bittle. Bittle cited what he saw as contradictions in pragmatism, such as using objective facts to prove that truth does not emerge from objective fact; this reveals that pragmatists do recognize truth as objective fact, and not, as they claim, what is useful. Bittle argued there are also some statements that cannot be judged on human welfare at all. Such statements (for example the assertion that ""a car is passing"") are matters of ""truth and error"" and do not affect human welfare.[93]

British philosopher Bertrand Russell devoted a chapter each to James and Dewey in his 1945 book A History of Western Philosophy; Russell pointed out areas in which he agreed with them but also ridiculed James's views on truth and Dewey's views on inquiry.[94]: 17 [95]: 120–124  Hilary Putnam later argued that Russell ""presented a mere caricature"" of James's views[94]: 17  and a ""misreading of James"",[94]: 20  while Tom Burke argued at length that Russell presented ""a skewed characterization of Dewey's point of view"".[95]: 121  Elsewhere, in Russell's book The Analysis of Mind, Russell praised James's radical empiricism, to which Russell's own account of neutral monism was indebted.[94]: 17 [96] Dewey, in The Bertrand Russell Case, defended Russell against an attempt to remove Russell from his chair at the College of the City of New York in 1940.[97]

Neopragmatism as represented by Richard Rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by other neopragmatists such as Susan Haack[98] and by many analytic philosophers.[99] Rorty's early analytic work, however, differs notably from his later work which some, including Rorty, consider to be closer to literary criticism than to philosophy, and which attracts the brunt of criticism from his detractors.

I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early [1870s] is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.
James credited Peirce again in 1906 lectures published in 1907 as Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.

I have always fathered my pragmaticism (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [pragmatism] imply ""the will to believe"", the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz. ...

Pragmatism originated in the United States in the 1870s with key figures like Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Peirce's pragmatic maxim emphasized understanding concepts through their practical effects. The term 'pragmatism' was first used in print by James in 1898. Pragmatism critiques idealist and realist philosophies for being disconnected from practical human experiences and emphasizes a scientific approach to knowledge. It has influenced various fields including public administration, education, bioethics, and aesthetics. Contemporary pragmatism is divided into strict analytic traditions and neo-classical pragmatism. Key contributors include Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, and Robert Brandom. The meeting concluded with discussions on the impact of pragmatism on ethics, emphasizing its humanist approach that values practical outcomes over abstract principles.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants greet each other and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Light banter to ease into the conversation"", ""Scene 2: Introduction to Pragmatism\nTLDR: Overview of pragmatism and its key figures.\n- Philosophy Professor gives a brief history of pragmatism\n- Mention of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey"", ""Scene 3: Practical Effects of Pragmatism\nTLDR: Discussing Peirce's pragmatic maxim and its implications.\n- Philosopher explains the pragmatic maxim\n- High School Teacher simplifies the concept with an example"", ""Scene 4: Pragmatism in Modern Contexts\nTLDR: Exploring contemporary applications of pragmatism.\n- Historian discusses historical impact on public administration, education, bioethics, and aesthetics\n- Philosophy Enthusiast shares relatable examples from everyday life"", ""Scene 5: Analytic vs. Neo-Classical Pragmatism\nTLDR: Differentiating between strict analytic traditions and neo-classical pragmatism.\n- Philosopher outlines key differences\n- Open floor for participants to share their thoughts"", ""Scene 6: Impact on Ethics\nTLDR: Examining how pragmatism influences ethical decision-making.\n- Philosophy Professor discusses humanist approach to ethics\n- Participants share personal experiences related to practical outcomes over abstract principles"", ""Scene 7: Open Discussion & Spontaneous Topics\nTLDR: Allowing for natural topic evolution and spontaneous contributions.\n- Participants bring up any related or unrelated topics they find interesting\n- Encouragement of off-topic moments for team bonding"", ""Scene 8: Personal Insights & Experiences\nTLDR: Sharing personal insights and experiences related to pragmatism or other interests.\n- Each participant shares a personal story or insight connected to the discussion so far"", ""Scene 9: Wrap-Up & Future Plans\nTLDR: Concluding the meeting with final thoughts and future plans.\n- Summarize key points discussed during the meeting\n- Discuss potential topics for future catch-ups""]",">>Philosophy Enthusiast: Hey everyone! How's it going? Did anyone else get caught in that crazy traffic this morning?

>>High School Teacher: Hey there! I'm good, thanks. Yeah, the traffic was a nightmare—I had to take a detour through downtown. But did you see that sunrise? It was amazing!

>>Historian: Morning, everyone! I'm doing well, thanks. The sunrise made me think of some historical events I've been studying—really brightened my morning.

>>Philosophy Professor: Good morning! Yeah, I saw it too. Quite a sight to start the day with.

>>Philosopher: Morning all. I missed the sunrise but heard it was spectacular. Traffic was rough though.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Yeah, it really was something special. Speaking of special moments, has anyone had anything exciting happen lately?

>>High School Teacher: Not much on my end—just gearing up for another week of classes. You know how it is.

>>Historian: Same here—working on some new research projects that are keeping me busy.

>>Philosophy Professor: I've been diving into some new readings on pragmatism—fascinating stuff.

>>Philosopher: That sounds interesting! I've been focusing on some applications of pragmatism in modern contexts. Always something new to explore. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: So, pragmatism as a philosophical tradition emerged in the late 19th century with Charles Sanders Peirce's pragmatic maxim. He suggested that the meaning of any concept lies in its practical effects. William James and John Dewey later expanded on this idea, emphasizing its application to real-world problems.

>>High School Teacher: Okay, so if I get this right, pragmatism is about how ideas work in real life? Like saying the value of a tool is in how well it gets the job done?

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Exactly! It's like saying that the truth of an idea depends on its practical effects. If it works in real life, then it's meaningful. For instance, think about democracy—its value isn't just theoretical but also in how it functions for society.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, pragmatism emerged as a response to the limitations of both rationalism and empiricism. Peirce's pragmatic maxim shifted focus from abstract theorizing to practical consequences. This was crucial because it made philosophy more applicable to everyday life.

>>Philosopher: Right, and from a pragmatic viewpoint, this fundamentally shifts our understanding of concepts by tying their meaning directly to practical effects. Imagine applying this to education—evaluating teaching methods based on student outcomes rather than just theory.

>>Philosophy Professor: Yes, exactly! By considering the practical implications of Peirce's pragmatic maxim, we redefine our approach to concepts by grounding them in tangible outcomes. This shift moves philosophy from abstract theorizing to addressing real-world issues.

>>High School Teacher: That makes sense. So pragmatism is all about practicality. But can you give me an example? How would this apply in my classroom?

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Sure! Think about project-based learning. Instead of just lecturing about historical events, you could have students create projects that demonstrate their understanding and relevance today. It’s a way to see if what they learn actually sticks and makes sense in real-life contexts.

>>Historian: Indeed! And looking at history itself through a pragmatic lens can be enlightening too. For example, examining how different political systems have worked out practically over time can provide valuable insights into their effectiveness.

>>Philosopher: From a pragmatic viewpoint, it's essential to recognize that the practical effects of an idea are what give it meaning. Imagine if we applied this thinking broadly—how would our decisions change if we constantly evaluated them based on their tangible outcomes? This approach not only grounds abstract ideas in reality but also challenges us to think critically about the consequences of our beliefs. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Consider this: Peirce's pragmatic maxim essentially asks us to evaluate the meaning of a concept by examining its practical effects. This method, in essence, transforms abstract philosophical inquiries into tangible, actionable insights. Wouldn't you agree that this approach not only demystifies complex ideas but also makes philosophy more accessible and relevant to everyday life?

>>High School Teacher: That's an interesting point. In my experience as a teacher, I've found that when I explain concepts like 'honesty' through their practical effects—like how being honest builds trust and better relationships—students grasp the idea much quicker. It really helps them see the value in these abstract concepts.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Yeah, I totally get that. It's like using Peirce's pragmatic maxim as a tool to cut through the fog of abstract ideas. For instance, if we want to understand 'justice,' we should look at what happens when justice is served. Does it lead to fairness and harmony in society? If so, that's the practical effect we're after.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, Peirce's pragmatic maxim emerged as a response to the often inaccessible nature of philosophical discourse at the time. By focusing on practical effects, it helped connect theory with practice and made these ideas more applicable across different contexts.

>>Philosopher: Let's consider 'truth' through this lens. From a pragmatic viewpoint, we should examine the practical effects of holding a belief as true. If believing in something leads to better decision-making and enhances our well-being, then those are the outcomes that define its meaning.

>>Philosophy Professor: Indeed! And imagine applying this maxim to 'democracy.' We must examine whether democratic practices foster inclusivity, equality, and civic engagement. If they do, these outcomes help us understand what democracy truly means.

>>High School Teacher: Exactly! And if we think about 'freedom,' it's important to look at what happens when people are free. Do they feel more fulfilled and creative? Does society benefit from their contributions? These real-world impacts help us grasp what freedom really entails.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Well yeah... if we think about it like that... Peirce's pragmatic maxim is like a lens that sharpens our view of abstract concepts. For example... when we talk about 'truth,' instead of getting lost in theoretical debates... we can ask what practical effects believing in a certain truth has on our lives... Does it help us make better decisions or improve our well-being?

>>Historian: And consider how this approach impacted historical understanding too—focusing on real-world outcomes made philosophical concepts more accessible and applicable across different contexts.

>>Philosopher: But don't you think there's a risk here? What if focusing solely on practical effects oversimplifies some concepts? Not everything valuable has immediate tangible outcomes.

>>Philosophy Professor: That's a valid concern. However, I believe Peirce's point was not to dismiss theoretical value but rather to ensure that our theories have some grounding in reality. It's about balance.

>>High School Teacher: I see your point there. Sometimes in teaching, emphasizing practicality can overshadow deeper understanding—but used wisely, it can bridge gaps for students who struggle with purely abstract thinking.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Right! So maybe it's about using Peirce's maxim as one tool among many—to clarify when needed but not replace deeper exploration entirely. 
 >>Historian: Looking back, pragmatism has had a huge impact across various fields. Take public administration, for example. Policies have become more responsive and adaptive because they focus on practical outcomes.

>>Philosophy Professor: Absolutely. And this isn't just a thing of the past; it's still shaping how we govern today. Policies are designed to be flexible and effective in addressing current societal needs.

>>High School Teacher: Right, so let's break it down for education. Pragmatism means focusing on what works best for students in real-life situations. Instead of just memorizing facts, students learn by doing projects that solve actual problems. Makes sense?

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Yeah, exactly! In our daily lives, pragmatism shows up in simple ways too. Like when we choose a route to work based on traffic reports or decide what to cook for dinner based on what's in the fridge—it's all about what works best at the moment.

>>Philosopher: Building on that, let's consider bioethics. From a pragmatic viewpoint, ethical decisions should be guided by their practical outcomes and real-world impacts. This ensures our moral choices are not just theoretically sound but also beneficial in tangible ways.

>>Philosophy Professor: Imagine if we applied pragmatism to aesthetics as well. The value of art would be measured by its impact on our daily lives and its ability to evoke meaningful experiences.

>>Historian: It's fascinating how these ideas have evolved over time. The shift towards policies that prioritize practical outcomes can be traced back to the early 20th century when these ideas began permeating governance structures.

>>High School Teacher: You know, in education, this approach really shines when we think about how students learn best through real-world scenarios rather than just reading theories from textbooks.

>>Philosopher: And this aligns perfectly with bioethics too—ethical decisions guided by practical outcomes ensure our moral choices are both theoretically sound and beneficial in tangible ways. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Consider this: the distinction between strict analytic traditions and neo-classical pragmatism lies in their approach to meaning and truth. Neo-classical pragmatism, as championed by Peirce, James, and Dewey, emphasizes the practical consequences of ideas as central to their meaning. What do you think?

>>High School Teacher: So if I get this right, neo-classical pragmatism is about focusing on what actually works in real life rather than just theory. Does that make sense?

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Yeah, exactly! It's all about the impact of ideas in practice. Like asking, 'How does this concept play out in reality?' If it doesn't have any real-world effects, does it really matter?

>>Historian: Historically speaking, the roots of this distinction can be traced back to their foundational philosophies. Peirce's pragmatic maxim emphasized practical effects as key to understanding concepts.

>>Philosopher: From a pragmatic viewpoint, it's not just an academic exercise but something fundamentally practical. Think about applying these approaches to issues like climate change or social justice. Theories need to be tested in real-world scenarios.

>>Philosophy Professor: Right! Imagine using the pragmatic maxim for contemporary issues. It's not just about theoretical distinctions but how these ideas work in practice.

>>High School Teacher: Exactly! If an idea doesn't help us solve a problem or improve our lives, then what's the point? It's like having a tool that you never use.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Well said! Neo-classical pragmatism brings philosophy down to earth. It's like saying, 'If it doesn't work practically, why bother?' You know?

>>Historian: And from a historical perspective, it's interesting how Peirce's pragmatic maxim has influenced not just philosophy but also fields like public administration and education.

>>Philosopher: We need to see how these theories work in real life. How do you think we could apply these principles to current global challenges?

>>Philosophy Professor: The pragmatic maxim shifts our understanding by grounding concepts in their practical effects. This aligns philosophical inquiry with real-world applications.

>>High School Teacher: So let's break it down again—neo-classical pragmatism is like a toolbox for solving real-world problems. It focuses on what works in practice rather than just theory.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Right! It asks us to look at the outcomes of our ideas. If a concept doesn't help us navigate the world better or solve problems, then what's its value? 

>>Historian: Historically speaking, Peirce's pragmatic maxim has had a profound impact on various fields by emphasizing practical outcomes over theoretical ideals. 
 >>Philosophy Professor: Consider this: when we apply pragmatism to ethics, we shift our focus from abstract moral principles to the tangible outcomes of our actions. This approach encourages us to evaluate ethical decisions based on their practical effects on human well-being and societal progress. Wouldn't you agree?
>>High School Teacher: Yeah, exactly! If we look at the real impact of our actions, it makes ethical decisions more relatable and easier to understand. It's like teaching students with real-life examples instead of just theories. Makes sense, right?
>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Right, so pragmatism in ethics is about choosing what leads to the best outcomes for everyone involved. It's not just about following rules but considering what actually works in real life. Like deciding whether to tell a white lie to spare someone's feelings—you'd weigh the potential harm against the benefits.
>>Historian: You know, this idea isn't new—thinkers like Peirce and James talked about focusing on practical outcomes way back when. They believed that ethical decisions should be judged by their real-world consequences rather than sticking strictly to abstract principles.
>>Philosophy Professor: Exactly! Take environmental conservation as an example. A pragmatic approach would focus on the tangible benefits of preserving ecosystems for future generations rather than just abstract principles of duty or virtue. This perspective can lead to more effective policies that directly improve human well-being and ecological health.
>>High School Teacher: Exactly! It's like when we teach students about honesty—
>>Philosopher (interrupting): Hold on, I just want to add something quickly before I forget.
>>High School Teacher: Sure.
>>Philosopher: Thanks! So, focusing only on practical outcomes might sometimes lead us astray if we're not careful about long-term impacts.
>>High School Teacher: Right! Instead of just saying 'honesty is a virtue,' we show them how being honest builds trust and strengthens relationships. So, in a way, pragmatism makes ethics more practical and relatable.
>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Think about how companies handle customer feedback—they don't just follow a set script; they adapt based on what's working and what's not. That's pragmatism in action—adjusting based on real-life results. 
 >>High School Teacher: Okay, so let's break it down. Imagine you're teaching a class and you notice that students are more engaged when you use real-world examples. That's pragmatism in education—adapting your methods based on what actually works to help students understand better. Does that make sense?

>>Philosophy Professor: Absolutely, it's not just about using real-world examples; it's also about adapting our methods based on what works best. For instance, I once changed my entire lecture style after noticing students responded better to interactive discussions rather than traditional lectures.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Right, and if we think beyond education, this approach can be applied to other areas too. Like in my job, I've found that being flexible with project management techniques really helps the team stay productive and motivated.

>>Historian: John Dewey's ideas have really influenced modern teaching methods. He was all about learning by doing and adjusting based on student needs.

>>Philosophy Professor: Exactly! And imagine if we could extend this adaptive approach beyond education into areas like public policy or healthcare—

>>Philosophy Enthusiast (interrupting): Sorry to jump in, but isn't there a risk that constantly changing methods might confuse students rather than help them? How do we balance consistency with adaptability?

>>Philosophy Professor: Good point! The key is finding a balance where changes are made thoughtfully and gradually, ensuring they enhance rather than disrupt learning.

>>Historian: Yeah, when policies are designed with a pragmatic approach, they tend to be more adaptive and responsive to societal needs. Like how during the Great Depression, policies were adjusted based on their impacts. 
 >>Philosophy Enthusiast: So, speaking of pragmatism in daily life, I remember this one time when I had to decide between two job offers. One was a dream job but far away, and the other was decent but close to home. I chose the practical option and stayed close to home, which allowed me to be more present for my family and community. Sometimes the practical choice brings more immediate satisfaction and real-world benefits.

>>High School Teacher: Yeah, that makes sense. I had a similar situation with teaching methods. There was this challenging class where I could either stick with traditional lectures or try something more interactive like project-based learning. I went with the latter, and it made a huge difference in student engagement and understanding.

>>Historian: Historically speaking, pragmatism has often been a response to rigid structures like rationalism and empiricism. Take John Dewey's educational reforms during the early 20th century—his emphasis on experiential learning over rote memorization was a practical application that transformed American education.

>>Philosophy Professor: Indeed, pragmatism is fundamentally about the practical consequences of our beliefs and actions. When developing a new curriculum for my philosophy course, I had to choose between a traditional lecture format and an interactive seminar style. The latter proved far more effective in engaging students and fostering critical thinking.

>>Philosopher: Let's consider pragmatism in personal relationships. Once, I had a disagreement with a close friend over something trivial. Instead of focusing on who was right or wrong, I thought about maintaining harmony and understanding.

>>Philosophy Enthusiast: You know, thinking about long-term impact can be just as practical too...

>>High School Teacher: Exactly! It's all about finding what works best for everyone involved...

>>Historian: From a historical perspective...

>>Philosophy Professor: Imagine applying pragmatism directly to teaching philosophy itself...

>>Philosopher: And think about conflict resolution at work... 
 >>Historian: Historically speaking, the application of pragmatism in conflict resolution has evolved significantly. Consider John Dewey's emphasis on democratic dialogue and its influence on modern mediation techniques.
>>High School Teacher (interjecting): That's true! And it's amazing how those historical insights can help us tackle today's problems.
>>Philosophy Professor: Exactly, our discussions have shown how pragmatism affects so many areas. It'd be interesting to see how it applies to current issues like climate change and social justice.
>>High School Teacher: I agree, and perhaps we could start by looking at specific case studies where pragmatism has been successfully applied.
>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Great idea! We could also invite guest speakers who have worked on these issues from a pragmatic perspective.
>>Historian (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—just wanted to add that connecting historical perspectives with current issues really helps us understand their practical relevance today.
>>Philosophy Enthusiast: Absolutely! It really shows the timeless relevance of these ideas. Maybe we could also look into its role in technology and innovation next time?
>>Philosophy Professor: Indeed, exploring its application to contemporary issues like climate change and social justice could provide us with valuable insights for future meetings."
