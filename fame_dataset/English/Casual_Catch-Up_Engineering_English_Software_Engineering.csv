Software Engineering,"Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.[1][2][3][4]

The terms programmer and coder overlap software engineer, but they imply only the construction aspect of a typical software engineer workload.[5]

A software engineer applies a software development process,[1][6] which involves defining, implementing, testing, managing, and maintaining software systems, as well as developing the software development process itself.

Beginning in the 1960s, software engineering was recognized as a separate field of engineering. 

The development of software engineering was seen as a struggle. Problems included software that was over budget, exceeded deadlines, required extensive debugging and maintenance, and unsuccessfully met the needs of consumers or was never even completed. 

In 1968, NATO held the first software engineering conference, where issues related to software were addressed. Guidelines and best practices for the development of software were established.[7]

The origins of the term software engineering have been attributed to various sources. The term appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of ""Computers and Automation""[8] and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) in ""President's Letter to the ACM Membership"" by Anthony A. Oettinger.[9][10][11] It is also associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer.[12] Margaret Hamilton described the discipline of ""software engineering"" during the Apollo missions to give what they were doing legitimacy.[13] At the time, there was perceived to be a ""software crisis"".[14][15][16] The 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) celebrates 50 years of ""Software Engineering"" with the Plenary Sessions' keynotes of Frederick Brooks[17] and Margaret Hamilton.[18]

In 1984, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.[19]
Watts Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process.[19] The Process Maturity Levels introduced became the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV), which defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.

Modern, generally accepted best practices for software engineering have been collected by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 subcommittee and published as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).[6] Software engineering is considered one of the major computing disciplines.[20]

Notable definitions of software engineering include:

The term has also been used less formally:

Individual commentators have disagreed sharply on how to define software engineering or its legitimacy as an engineering discipline. David Parnas has said that software engineering is, in fact, a form of engineering.[30][31] Steve McConnell has said that it is not, but that it should be.[32] Donald Knuth has said that programming is an art and a science.[33] Edsger W. Dijkstra claimed that the terms software engineering and software engineer have been misused in the United States.[34]

Requirements engineering is about elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software. Software requirements can be functional, non-functional or domain. 

Functional requirements describe expected behaviors (i.e. outputs). Non-functional requirements specify issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance, reusability, and flexibility. They are classified into the following types: interface constraints, performance constraints (such as response time, security, storage space, etc.), operating constraints, life cycle constraints (maintainability, portability, etc.), and economic constraints. Knowledge of how the system or software works is needed when it comes to specifying non-functional requirements. Domain requirements have to do with the characteristic of a certain category or domain of projects.[35]

Software design is the process of making high-level plans for the software. Design is sometimes divided into levels: 

Software construction typically involves programming (a.k.a. coding), unit testing, integration testing, and debugging so as to implement the design.[1][6]“Software testing is related to, but different from, ... debugging”.[6]
Testing during this phase is generally performed by the programmer and with the purpose to verify that the code behaves as designed and to know when the code is ready for the next level of testing.[citation needed]

Software testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software under test.[1][6]

When described separately from construction, testing typically is performed by test engineers or quality assurance instead of the programmers who wrote it.  It is performed at the system level and is considered an aspect of software quality.

Program analysis is the process of analyzing computer programs with respect to an aspect such as performance, robustness, and security.

Software maintenance refers to supporting the software after release. It may include but is not limited to: error correction, optimization, deletion of unused and discarded features, and enhancement of existing features.[1][6]

Usually, maintenance takes up 40% to 80% of project cost.[37]

Knowledge of computer programming is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004, the IEEE Computer Society produced the SWEBOK, which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2005, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.[38]
Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery, and updated in 2014.[20] A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; as of 2010[update], there were 244 Campus Bachelor of Software Engineering programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.

In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through military service in software engineering.

Half of all practitioners today have degrees in computer science, information systems, or information technology.[citation needed] A small but growing number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987, the Department of Computing at Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering bachelor's degree in the world; in the following year, the University of Sheffield established a similar program.[39] In 1996, the Rochester Institute of Technology established the first software engineering bachelor's degree program in the United States; however, it did not obtain ABET accreditation until 2003, the same year as Rice University, Clarkson University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Mississippi State University.[40] In 1997, PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, India was the first to start a five-year integrated Master of Science degree in Software Engineering.[citation needed]

Since then, software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities. A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees, SE2004, was defined by a steering committee between 2001 and 2004 with funding from the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. As of 2004[update], about 50 universities in the U.S. offer software engineering degrees, which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices. The first software engineering master's degree was established at Seattle University in 1979. Since then, graduate software engineering degrees have been made available from many more universities. Likewise in Canada, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers has recognized several software engineering programs.

In 1998, the US Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) established the first doctorate program in Software Engineering in the world.[citation needed] Additionally, many online advanced degrees in Software Engineering have appeared such as the Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSE) degree offered through the Computer Science and Engineering Department at California State University, Fullerton. Steve McConnell opines that because most universities teach computer science rather than software engineering, there is a shortage of true software engineers.[41] ETS (École de technologie supérieure) University and UQAM (Université du Québec à Montréal) were mandated by IEEE to develop the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer.[6]

Legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer. In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario,[42] and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the European Engineer (EUR ING) professional title. Software Engineers can also become professionally qualified as a Chartered Engineer through the British Computer Society.

In the United States, the NCEES began offering a Professional Engineer exam for Software Engineering in 2013, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized.[43] NCEES ended the exam after April 2019 due to lack of participation.[44] Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial.[45][46]

The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge – 2004 Version, or SWEBOK, defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current version is SWEBOK v4.[6] The IEEE also promulgates a ""Software Engineering Code of Ethics"".[47]

There are an estimated 26.9 million professional software engineers in the world as of 2022, up from 21 million in 2016.[48][49]

Many software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Many companies hire interns, often university or college students during a summer break, or externships. Specializations include analysts, architects, developers, testers, technical support, middleware analysts, project managers, software product managers, educators, and researchers.

Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008.[50] Potential injuries in these occupations are possible because like other workers who spend long periods sitting in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, Thrombosis, Obesity, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.[51]

The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counted 1,365,500 software developers holding jobs in the U.S. in 2018.[52] Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees.[53] The BLS estimates from 2023 to 2033 that computer software engineering would increase by 17%.[54] This is down from the 2022 to 2032 BLS estimate of 25% for software engineering.[54][55] And, is further down from their 30% 2010 to 2020 BLS estimate.[56] Due to this trend, job growth may not be as fast as during the last decade, as jobs that would have gone to computer software engineers in the United States would instead be outsourced to computer software engineers in countries such as India and other foreign countries.[57][50] In addition, the BLS Job Outlook for Computer Programmers, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook predicts a decline of -7 percent from 2016 to 2026, a further decline of -9 percent from 2019 to 2029, a decline of -10 percent from 2021 to 2031.[57] and then a decline of -11 percent from 2022 to 2032.[57] Since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower.[57][58][59] Furthermore, the ratio of women in many software fields has also been declining over the years as compared to other engineering fields.[60] Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in Artificial Intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software Engineers.[61][62][63][64][65][66][67] However, this trend may change or slow in the future as many current software engineers in the U.S. market flee the profession or age out of the market in the next few decades.[57]

The Software Engineering Institute offers certifications on specific topics like security, process improvement and software architecture.[68] IBM, Microsoft and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many IT certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies.[69] These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. As of 2006[update], the IEEE had certified over 575 software professionals as a Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP).[70] In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).[71] The ACM had a professional certification program in the early 1980s,[citation needed] which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM and the IEEE Computer Society together examined the possibility of licensing of software engineers as Professional Engineers in the 1990s,
but eventually decided that such licensing was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.[45] John C. Knight and Nancy G. Leveson presented a more balanced analysis of the licensing issue in 2002.[46]

In the U.K. the British Computer Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called Chartered IT Professional (CITP), available to fully qualified members (MBCS). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the British Computer Society or Institution of Engineering and Technology and so qualify to be considered for Chartered Engineer status through either of those institutions. In Canada the Canadian Information Processing Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called Information Systems Professional (ISP).[72] In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) accredited program, successfully complete PEO's (Professional Engineers Ontario) Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the Professional Engineers Ontario and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng.[73] The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.

The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / time zone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers.[74] Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected.[75] Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the follow-the-sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.[76] When North Americans leave work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans arrive to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.

While global outsourcing has several advantages, global – and generally distributed – development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations).[77] Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.

There are various prizes in the field of software engineering:

Some call for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.[81]

Some claim that the concept of software engineering is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.[82]

Some claim that a core issue with software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a ""theoretical environment.""[82]

Edsger Dijkstra, a founder of many of the concepts in software development today, rejected the idea of ""software engineering"" up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called the ""radical novelty"" of computer science:


A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name ""Software Engineering"". As economics is known as ""The Miserable Science"", software engineering should be known as ""The Doomed Discipline"", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter ""How to program if you cannot.""[83]","[""Software development process"", ""Software engineering history"", ""Requirements engineering"", ""Software

engineering to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. It was noted that while terms like programmer and coder overlap with software engineer, they primarily refer to the construction aspect of the role. The history of software engineering dates back to the 1960s when it emerged as a distinct discipline due to challenges such as budget overruns and unmet consumer needs. Key milestones include NATO's first conference in 1968 and the establishment of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in 1984. Modern best practices are encapsulated in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Educational pathways for software engineers typically involve university degrees, with notable programs established globally since the late 20th century. Certification and licensing vary by region, with some areas offering professional titles like P.Eng or EUR ING. Outsourcing has impacted job growth trends, leading to concerns about job security among practitioners. Despite debates over its legitimacy as an engineering discipline, software engineering remains a critical field with ongoing research into global development challenges.","[""Scene 1: Brief Greeting\nTLDR: Participants exchange brief greetings and set a casual tone for the meeting.\n- Quick hellos and how are yous\n- Light-hearted comments to ease into the conversation"", ""Scene 2: Software Engineering Overview\nTLDR: Discuss the field of software engineering, its principles, and practices.\n- Mention integration of computer science and engineering principles\n- Highlight key milestones like NATO's first conference in 1968"", ""Scene 3: Historical Context\nTLDR: Explore the history and evolution of software engineering.\n- Discuss challenges faced in the 1960s leading to its emergence as a distinct discipline\n- Reference establishment of SEI in 1984"", ""Scene 4: Modern Best Practices\nTLDR: Talk about current best practices encapsulated in SWEBOK.\n- Share insights on modern methodologies and standards\n- Discuss educational pathways for software engineers"", ""Scene 5: Certification and Licensing\nTLDR: Examine regional variations in certification and licensing for software engineers.\n- Mention professional titles like P.Eng or EUR ING\n- Debate legitimacy as an engineering discipline"", ""Scene 6: Impact of Outsourcing\nTLDR: Address concerns about job security due to outsourcing trends.\n- Discuss impact on job growth trends among practitioners\n- Share personal experiences related to outsourcing"", ""Scene 7: Open Discussion on Global Development Challenges\nTLDR: Engage in spontaneous discussion about ongoing research into global development challenges.\n- Encourage brainstorming on potential solutions\n- Allow participants to share their perspectives freely"", ""Scene 8: Personal Insights and Experiences\nTLDR: Share personal stories related to software engineering roles.\n- Invite participants to talk about their career journeys and memorable projects\n- Foster deeper connections through storytelling"", ""Scene 9: Casual Off-topic Moments\nTLDR: Allow brief off-topic discussions for natural flow.\n- Share light-hearted anecdotes or recent non-work-related events\n- Encourage laughter and camaraderie among participants""]",">>Software Engineer: Hey everyone! How's it going?
>>Historian: Hi there! I'm doing well, thanks.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Hey folks! I'm good, thanks. Did anyone catch the latest tech news? Some exciting stuff happening!
>>Requirements Engineer: Yeah, I saw some interesting updates in tech recently.

>>Software Engineer: Awesome to hear! Any fun plans for the weekend?
>>Historian: Well, actually, I might visit a museum exhibit on the history of computing. What about you all?
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: That sounds fascinating! Which museum? I'm planning to relax and maybe catch up on some reading.
>>Requirements Engineer: Nice! If the weather holds up, I might go hiking. Have you been there before? 
 >>Software Engineer: So, software engineering really took off after NATO's first conference in 1968. But it's not just about history; the integration of computer science and engineering principles has led to practices like Agile and DevOps, which are game-changers! How can we leverage these methodologies to improve our current projects?
>>Historian: You know, the NATO conference in 1968 was indeed pivotal. However, it's fascinating to note that the term 'software engineering' had been used even earlier. This historical context highlights how the field has evolved from addressing a 'software crisis' to establishing rigorous methodologies like Agile and DevOps.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: While Agile and DevOps are transformative, we must not overlook the importance of rigorous testing. Quality is key. How can we ensure our testing processes are robust enough to catch all potential issues?
>>Requirements Engineer: Well, user needs and specifications are often overlooked but they're crucial. Speaking of rigorous testing, how do we ensure our requirements are adaptable during development while maintaining quality?
>>Software Engineer: Agile and DevOps have significantly improved flexibility and collaboration. But how can we ensure that our software design remains robust while adopting these methodologies?
>>Historian: It's interesting how structured methodologies like Agile and DevOps have evolved from past challenges in software development.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Actually, while Agile and DevOps are great for flexibility—
>>Requirements Engineer (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here—could you clarify what you mean by ""rigorous testing""? Are there specific standards or tools you're referring to?
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Great question! By rigorous testing, I mean adhering strictly to established protocols like automated unit tests, integration tests, performance tests... basically ensuring every aspect is covered comprehensively.
>>(Phone rings softly)
>>(Everyone chuckles)
>>Software Engineer (smiling): As I was saying before that interruption—how can we ensure that our architecture remains scalable and maintainable? 
 >>Historian: The 1960s were a pivotal decade for software engineering. The term 'software crisis' emerged because projects consistently ran over budget and exceeded deadlines. This led to the first NATO conference in 1968, where foundational guidelines and best practices were established.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Right, so the establishment of SEI in 1984 was a significant milestone. It aimed to address the persistent issues in software development processes. But how did it specifically impact quality control and testing practices?
>>Historian: Yes, SEI really changed things up in '84. It formalized and improved software development processes, addressing issues like quality control and testing practices. One major outcome was the Capability Maturity Model, which provided structured frameworks for evaluating and improving software processes.
>>Requirements Engineer: Well, um, the Capability Maturity Model was indeed a game-changer. But let's clarify this! How did it specifically address user needs and specifications during its early implementation?
>>Software Engineer: Yeah, I'm curious about that too! So, how did teams approach user needs and specifications back then with this model?
>>Historian: Good question! Early on, the Capability Maturity Model emphasized iterative development and continuous improvement. Teams would refine their approaches based on feedback to better meet evolving user needs.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Hmm... while it provided a structured framework, it often overlooked some nuances of quality control in testing. How can we improve this aspect today?
>>Requirements Engineer: I mean, it's clear that structured frameworks are essential but ensuring they adapt to user needs is equally important.
>>Software Engineer: Absolutely! And speaking of adapting to user needs—how did early implementations handle these evolving requirements? 
>>Historian: Iterative development allowed teams to continuously refine their approaches based on feedback. This was key in adapting to changing requirements effectively.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Got it. So while iterative development helped with adaptability, what specific strategies can we use now to enhance quality control during testing phases?
>>Requirements Engineer: You know, I've found that incorporating automated testing tools has made a huge difference in catching issues early on.
>>Software Engineer: Totally agree! In my last project, we used continuous integration pipelines which really streamlined our testing process. 
 >>Requirements Engineer: Well, speaking of best practices, SWEBOK really encapsulates the modern methodologies we should be following. It's crucial to ensure that user needs and specifications are clearly defined from the start. How can we specify these better to avoid any miscommunication?
>>Historian: That's a great point. Clear specifications have always been essential in avoiding project failures. Maybe we could look at some successful case studies where clear requirements made a difference.
>>Software Engineer: One way to specify user needs better is by using user stories and personas. These tools help us understand the user's perspective and ensure we're meeting their actual needs. For example, in our last project, using detailed personas helped us identify key features that were initially overlooked.
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: While user stories and personas are great tools, we must also ensure rigorous testing protocols to validate these requirements. Quality is key. How can we improve this?
>>Historian: Building on what you said about quality, I remember reading about how automated testing significantly improved reliability in several major projects.
>>Software Engineer: To improve our testing protocols, we could integrate automated testing tools more extensively. These tools can help us catch issues early and ensure that our user stories and personas are accurately validated. What do you think?
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: Automated testing tools are essential, but we must also ensure our test cases cover all possible scenarios. Missing edge cases could lead to significant problems down the line.
>>Requirements Engineer: Right! And while we're at it, let's not forget about continuous integration pipelines—they streamline everything even further.
>>Historian: Continuous integration pipelines have evolved significantly since their inception and have proven effective in maintaining consistent quality throughout development cycles.
>>Software Engineer: Exactly! Continuous integration pipelines definitely help with streamlining processes. But how do we make sure our initial requirements are spot-on? Any ideas?
>>Quality Assurance Specialist: We need robust validation techniques right from the start—like peer reviews or requirement workshops—to catch potential issues early on.
>>Requirements Engineer: Absolutely! Peer reviews can be incredibly effective for catching those initial mistakes before they snowball into bigger problems.
>>Historian: Peer reviews have been a cornerstone in improving software quality since their introduction in formal methodologies during the late 20th century.
