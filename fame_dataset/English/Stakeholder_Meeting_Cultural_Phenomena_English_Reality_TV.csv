Reality TV,"

Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations, often starring ordinary people rather than professional actors. Reality television emerged as a distinct genre in the early 1990s with shows such as The Real World, then achieved prominence in the early 2000s with the success of the series Survivor, Idol, and Big Brother, all of which became global franchises.[1] Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with ""confessionals"", short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen; this is most commonly seen in American reality television. Competition-based reality shows typically feature the gradual elimination of participants, either by a panel of judges, by the viewership of the show, or by the contestants themselves.

Documentaries, television news, sports television, talk shows, and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television. Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television, including hidden camera shows, talent-search shows, documentary series about ordinary people, high-concept game shows, home improvement shows, and court shows featuring real-life cases and issues.

Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity. Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality, in ways both implicit (participants being placed in artificial situations), and deceptive (misleading editing, participants being coached on behavior, storylines generated ahead of time, scenes being staged). Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win. Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame, infamous figures, or both; and that they glamorize vulgarity.

Television formats portraying ordinary people in unscripted situations are almost as old as the television medium itself. Producer-host Allen Funt's Candid Camera, in which unsuspecting people were confronted with funny, unusual situations and filmed with hidden cameras, first aired in 1948. In the 21st century, the series is often considered a prototype of reality television programming.[2][3]

In the early 1940s the young German television station, named after Paul Nipkow had  staged a show in which a young couple acted as model Aryans and presented their everyday lives without a script to the camera
(Familienchroniken - Ein Abend mit Hans und Gelli). Even though it was clearly Nazi propaganda and the episodes were certainly affected by censorship, in recent years the show has been presented more frequently as the oldest reality TV show in the world.[4]

Precedents for television that portrayed people in unscripted situations began in the late 1940s. Queen for a Day (1945–1964) was an early example of reality-based television. The 1946 television game show Cash and Carry sometimes featured contestants performing stunts. Debuting in 1948, Allen Funt's hidden camera show Candid Camera  (based on his previous 1947 radio show, The Candid Microphone) broadcast unsuspecting ordinary people reacting to pranks.[5] In 1948, talent search shows, such as Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour and Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, featured amateur competitors and audience voting. In the 1950s, game shows Beat the Clock and Truth or Consequences involved contestants in wacky competitions, stunts, and practical jokes. Confession was a crime and police show that aired from June 1958 to January 1959, with interviewer Jack Wyatt questioning criminals from assorted backgrounds.[6] The radio series Nightwatch (1951–1955) tape-recorded the daily activities of Culver City, California police officers. The series You Asked for It (1950–1959) incorporated audience involvement by basing episodes around requests sent in by postcard from viewers.

First broadcast in the United Kingdom in 1964, the Granada Television documentary Seven Up! broadcast interviews with a dozen ordinary 7-year-olds from a broad cross-section of society and inquired about their reactions to everyday life. Every seven years, the filmmaker created a new film documenting the lives of the same individuals during the intervening period. Titled the Up Series, episodes included ""7 Plus Seven"", ""21 Up"", etc.; it is still ongoing. The program was structured as a series of interviews with no element of the plot. By virtue of the attention paid to the participants, it effectively turned ordinary people into a type of celebrity, especially after they became adults.[citation needed]

The series The American Sportsman, which ran from 1965 to 1986 on ABC in the United States,[7][8] would typically feature one or more celebrities, and sometimes their family members, being accompanied by a camera crew on an outdoor adventure, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, scuba diving, rock climbing, wildlife photography, horseback riding, race car driving, and the like, with most of the resulting action and dialogue being unscripted, except for the narration.

In the 1966 Direct Cinema film Chelsea Girls, Andy Warhol filmed various acquaintances with no direction given. The Radio Times Guide to Film 2007 said that the film was ""to blame for reality television"".[9]

In 1969, the British rock group the Beatles were filmed for a month during the recording sessions which would become their album Let It Be and released the homonymous film the following year. In 2021, director Peter Jackson created an eight-hour, three-episode television series entitled The Beatles: Get Back.[10]

The 12-part 1973 PBS series An American Family showed a nuclear family (filmed in 1971) going through a divorce; unlike many later reality shows, it was more or less documentary in purpose and style. In 1974 a counterpart program, The Family, was made in the UK, following the working-class Wilkins family of Reading.[11] Other forerunners of modern reality television were the 1970s productions of Chuck Barris: The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, and The Gong Show, all of which featured participants who were eager to sacrifice some of their privacy and dignity in a televised competition.[12]

The 1976–1980 BBC series The Big Time featured a different amateur in some field (cooking, comedy, football, etc.) trying to succeed professionally in that field, with help from notable experts. The 15-episode series is credited with starting the career of Sheena Easton, who was selected to appear in the episode showing an aspiring pop singer trying to enter the music business.[13]

In 1978, Living in the Past had amateurs participating in a re-enactment of life in an Iron Age English village.

Producer George Schlatter capitalized on the advent of videotape to create Real People, a surprise hit for NBC, and it ran from 1979 to 1984. The success of Real People was quickly copied by ABC with That's Incredible, a stunt show produced by Alan Landsburg and co-hosted by Fran Tarkenton; CBS's entry into the genre was That's My Line, a series hosted by Bob Barker. The Canadian series Thrill of a Lifetime, a fantasies-fulfilled reality show, originally ran from 1982 to 1988. It was revived from 2001 to 2003. In 1985, underwater cinematographer Al Giddings teamed with former Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly on the NBC series Oceanquest, which chronicled Weatherly's adventures scuba diving in various exotic locales. Weatherly was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in informational programming.[14]
COPS, which first aired in the spring of 1989 on Fox and was developed due to the need for new programming during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike,[15] showed police officers on duty apprehending criminals. It introduced the camcorder look and cinéma vérité feel of much of later reality television. The 1991 television documentary on ""typical American high schoolers"", Yearbook, focused on seniors attending Glenbard West High School, in Glen Ellyn, Illinois and broadcast prime-time on Fox.

The series Nummer 28, which aired on Dutch television in 1991, originated the concept of putting strangers together in a limited environment for an extended period of time and recording the drama that ensued. Nummer 28 also pioneered many of the stylistic conventions that have since become standard in reality television shows, including extensive use of soundtrack music and the interspersing of events on screen with after-the-fact ""confessionals"" recorded by cast members, which serve as narration. Nummer 28 became the model for many later series of Big Brother and its clones, and Peter Weir's full-length film The Truman Show. One year later, the same concept was used by MTV in its new series The Real World. Nummer 28 creator Erik Latour has long claimed that The Real World was directly inspired by his show.[16] But the producers of The Real World have said that their direct inspiration was An American Family.[17] According to television commentator Charlie Brooker, this type of reality television was enabled by the advent of computer-based non-linear editing systems for video (such as produced by Avid Technology) in 1989. These systems made it easy to quickly edit hours of video footage into a usable form, something that had been very difficult to do before (film, which was easy to edit, was too expensive to use in shooting enough hours on a regular basis).[18]

Sylvania Waters (1992) was an Australian show that depicted a family, similar in concept to An American Family.

The 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, during which live network television followed suspect Simpson for 90 minutes being chased by police, has been described as a seminal moment in reality television. Networks interrupted their regular television programming for months for coverage of the trial and related events. Because of Simpson's status as a top athlete and celebrity, the brutal nature of the murders, and issues of race and class in Los Angeles celebrity culture, the sensational case dominated ratings and the public conversation.[19][20]

Many reality television stars of the 2000s and 2010s have direct or indirect connections to people involved in the case, most notably Kim Kardashian, daughter of defense attorney Robert Kardashian, and several of her relatives and associates.[21][22]

The series Expedition Robinson, created by television producer Charlie Parsons, which first aired in 1997 in Sweden (and was later produced in a large number of other countries as Survivor), added to the Nummer 28/Real World template the idea of competition and elimination. Cast members or contestants battled against each other and were removed from the show until only one winner remained (these shows are now sometimes called elimination shows). Changing Rooms, a program that began in the UK in 1996, showed couples redecorating each other's houses, and was the first[citation needed] reality show with a self-improvement or makeover theme. The dating reality show Streetmate premiered in the UK in 1998. Originally created by Gabe Sachs as Street Match, it was a flop in the United States. But the show was revamped in the UK by Tiger Aspect Productions and became a cult hit. The production team from the original series later created the popular reality shows Strictly Come Dancing, Location, Location, Location, and the revamped MasterChef, among others.[citation needed] The 1980s and 1990s were also a time when tabloid talk shows became more popular. Many of these featured the same types of unusual or dysfunctional guests who would later become popular as cast members of reality shows.

Reality television became globally popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the successes of the Big Brother and Survivor/Expedition Robinson franchises. In the United States, reality television programs suffered a temporary decline in viewership in 2001, leading some entertainment industry columnists[who?] to speculate that the genre was a temporary fad that had run its course.[citation needed] Reality shows that suffered from low ratings included The Amazing Race (although the show has since recovered and is in its 32nd edition), Lost (unrelated to the better-known serial drama of the same name) and The Mole (which was successful in other countries).[23] But stronghold shows Survivor and American Idol continued to thrive: both topped the U.S. season-average television ratings in the 2000s. Survivor led the ratings in 2001–02, and Idol has the longest hold on the No. 1 rank in the American television ratings, dominating over all other primetime programs and other television series in the overall viewership tallies for eight consecutive years, from the 2003–2004 to the 2010–2011 television seasons.

Another trend was to combine reality TV with a social history angle usually by having contestants taken back to various time periods primarily to see how millennials would cope without modern technology. Examples included The 1900 House, Bad Lads' Army and That'll Teach 'Em. In addition to those was a series consisting of archeologists and historians running a farm though various historical periods, most notably Victorian Farm.

Internationally, a number of shows created in the late 1990s and 2000s have had massive global success. Reality-television franchises created during that time that have had more than 30 international adaptations each include the singing competition franchises Idols,[24] Star Academy[25] and The X Factor, other competition franchises Survivor/Expedition Robinson, Big Brother, The Biggest Loser, Come Dine with Me, Got Talent, Top Model, MasterChef, Project Runway and Dancing with the Stars, and the investment franchise Dragons' Den. Several ""reality game shows"" from the same period have had even greater success, including Deal or No Deal, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and Weakest Link, with over 50 international adaptions each. (All but four of these franchises, Top Model, Project Runway, The Biggest Loser and Dragons' Den, were created by either British producers or the Dutch production company Endemol. Although Dragons' Den originated in Japan, most of its adaptations are based on the British version.) In India, the competition show Indian Idol was the most popular television program for its first six seasons.[26]

During the 2000s, several cable networks, including Bravo, A&E, E!, TLC, History, VH1, and MTV, changed their programming to feature mostly reality television series.[27] In addition, three cable channels were started around that time that were devoted exclusively to reality television: Fox Reality in the United States, which operated from 2005 to 2010; Global Reality Channel in Canada, which lasted two years from 2010 to 2012; and CBS Reality (formerly known as Reality TV and then Zone Reality) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which has run from 1999 to the present.

During the early part of the 2000s, network executives expressed concern that reality-television programming was limited in its appeal for DVD reissue and syndication. But DVDs for reality shows sold briskly; Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, The Amazing Race, Project Runway, and America's Next Top Model all ranked in the top DVDs sold on Amazon.com. In the mid-2000s, DVDs of The Simple Life outranked scripted shows such as The O.C. and Desperate Housewives. Syndication, however, has been problematic; shows such as Fear Factor, COPS, and Wife Swap, in which each episode is self-contained, can be rerun fairly easily, but usually only on cable television or during the daytime (COPS and America's Funniest Home Videos being exceptions). Season-long competitions, such as The Amazing Race, Survivor, and America's Next Top Model generally perform more poorly and usually must be rerun in marathons to draw the necessary viewers to make it worthwhile. (Even in these cases, it is not always successful: the first ten seasons of Dancing with the Stars were picked up by GSN in 2012 and was run in marathon format, but attracted low viewership and had very poor ratings). Another option is to create documentaries around series, including extended interviews with the participants and outtakes not seen in the original airings; the syndicated series American Idol Rewind is an example of this strategy.

COPS has had huge success in syndication, direct response sales, and DVD. A Fox staple since 1989, COPS has, as of 2013 (when it moved to cable channel Spike), outlasted all competing scripted police shows. Another series that had wide success is Cheaters, which has been running since 2000 in the U.S. and is syndicated in over 100 countries worldwide. In 2001, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences added the reality genre to the Emmy Awards in the category of Outstanding Reality Program. In 2003, to better differentiate between competition and informational reality programs, a second category, Outstanding Reality-Competition Program, was added. In 2008, a third category, Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program, was added. In 2007, the web series The Next Internet Millionaire appeared; it was a competition show based in part on The Apprentice, and was billed as the world's first Internet reality show.

In 2010, the Dutch singing competition show The Voice of Holland, created by John de Mol Jr., premiered; it added to the singing competition template the twist that judges could not see contestants during the initial audition round, and could judge them only by their voice. The show was an instant success, and spawned an entire franchise, The Voice, which has been highly successful, with almost 50 international adaptations.

The Tester (2010–2012) was the first reality television show aired over a video game console.[28]

By 2012, many of the long-running reality television show franchises in the United States, such as American Idol, Dancing with the Stars and The Bachelor, had begun to see declining ratings.[29] However, reality television as a whole remained durable in the U.S., with hundreds of shows across many channels. In 2012, New York Magazine's Vulture blog published a humorous Venn diagram showing popular themes across American reality shows then running, including shows set in the U.S. states of Alaska, Louisiana and Texas, shows about cakes, weddings and pawnbrokers, and shows, usually competition-based, whose title includes the word ""Wars"".[30]

Duck Dynasty (2012–2017), which focused on the Robertson family that founded Duck Commander, in 2013 became the most popular reality series in U.S. cable television history. Its fourth-season premiere was viewed by nearly 12 million viewers in the United States, most of which were in rural markets. Its rural audience share ranked in the 30s, an extremely high number for any series, broadcast or cable.

Following from the 1900 House format, the BBC produced a series called Back in Time for Tea in which a family would experience tea time for various decades.

In 2014, Entertainment Weekly and Variety again noted a stagnation in reality television programs' ratings in the U.S., which they attributed to ""The diminishing returns of cable TV's sea of reality sameness"". They noted that a number of networks that featured reality programming, including Bravo and E!, were launching their first scripted shows, and others, including AMC, were abandoning plans to launch further reality programs; though they clarified that the genre as a whole ""isn't going anywhere.""[31][32] Ratings and profits from reality TV continued to decline in the late 2010s.[33]

The South Korean competition show I Can See Your Voice, which premiered in 2015, showed guest judges attempting to guess which of a group of contestants could sing, and which could not, without hearing them sing. The show was successful, and spawned several imitators, most notably King of Mask Singer several months later. King of Mask Singer was a more traditional singing competition show, but with the wrinkle that the contestants were celebrities who remained masked until they were removed from the show, adding an element of guesswork to the competition.[34] The two shows both spawned successful international franchises, I Can See Your Voice and Masked Singer, respectively. Masked Singer has been especially popular, with over 50 local adaptations; its American adaptation was the third highest-rated series overall of both the 2018–19 and 2019–20 television seasons.[35] The success of the two franchises has led to other globally-syndicated franchises of reality competitions based around guesswork, such as Game of Talents (which began in Spain in 2019) and The Masked Dancer (which began in the United States in 2020).[36]

Specialist skill-based TV competitions became popular during this decade with such programs like The Great British Bake-Off, Lego Masters, The Great British Sewing Bee and Forged in Fire shown.

Television development across all genres was impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many reality competition series to suspend production (and in some cases curtail a competition already in progress, such as Canadian and Malayalam versions of Big Brother),[37][38][39] until such time that production could recommence with appropriate health and safety protocols approved by local authorities.[40][41] Due to their quicker turnaround times, the U.S. networks used reality series and other unscripted content (including those delayed from their summer lineups) to fill gaps in their schedules while the production of scripted programming resumed.[42][43]

There have been various attempts to classify reality television shows into different subgenres:

Another categorization divides reality television into two types: shows that purport to document real life, and shows that place participants in new circumstances. In a 2003 paper, theorists Elisabeth Klaus and Stephanie Lücke referred to the former category as ""docusoaps"", which consist of ""narrative reality"", and the latter category as ""reality soaps"", which consist of ""performative reality"".[47] Since 2014, the Primetime Emmy Awards have used a similar classification, with separate awards for ""unstructured reality"" and ""structured reality"" programs, as well as a third award for ""reality-competition"" programs.

In many reality television programs, camera shooting and footage editing give the viewer the impression that they are passive observers following people going about their daily personal and professional activities; this style of filming is sometimes referred to as fly on the wall, observational documentary or factual television. Story ""plots"" are often constructed via editing or planned situations, with the results resembling soap operas – hence the terms docusoap and docudrama. Documentary-style programs give viewers a private look into the lives of the subjects.

Within documentary-style reality television are several subcategories or variants:

Although the term ""docusoap"" has been used for many documentary-style reality television shows, there have been shows that have deliberately tried to mimic the appearance and structure of soap operas. Such shows often focus on a close-knit group of people and their shifting friendships and romantic relationships. One highly influential such series was the American 2004–2006 series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, which attempted to specifically mimic the primetime soap opera The O.C., which had begun airing in 2003. Laguna Beach had a more drama-like feel than any previous reality television show, through the use of higher-quality lighting and cameras, voice-over narration instead of on-screen ""confessionals"", and slower pacing.[48] Laguna Beach led to several spinoff series, most notably the 2006–2010 series The Hills. It also inspired various other series, including the highly successful British series The Only Way Is Essex and Made in Chelsea, and the Australian series Freshwater Blue.

Due to their dramatized feel, many of these shows have been accused of being pre-scripted, more so than other reality television shows have. The producers of The Only Way Is Essex and Made in Chelsea have admitted to coaching cast members on what to say in order to draw more emotion from each scene, although they insist that the underlying stories are real.[49]

Another highly successful group of soap-opera-style shows is the Real Housewives franchise, which began with The Real Housewives of Orange County in 2006 and has since spawned nearly twenty other series, in the U.S. and internationally. The franchise has an older cast and different personal dynamics than that of Laguna Beach and its imitators, as well as lower production values, but similarly is meant to resemble scripted soap operas – in this case, the television series Desperate Housewives and Peyton Place.

A notable subset of such series focus on a group of women who are romantically connected to male celebrities; these include Basketball Wives (2010), Love & Hip Hop (2011), Hollywood Exes (2012), Ex-Wives of Rock (2012) and WAGS (2015). Most of these shows have had spin-offs in multiple locations.

There are also fly-on-the-wall-style shows directly involving celebrities. Often these show a celebrity going about their everyday life: notable examples include The Anna Nicole Show, The Osbournes, Gene Simmons Family Jewels, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Hogan Knows Best. VH1 in the mid-2000s had an entire block of such shows, known as ""Celebreality"". Shows such as these are often created with the idea of promoting a celebrity product or upcoming project.

Some documentary-style shows shed light on rarely seen cultures and lifestyles. One example is shows about people with disabilities[50] or people who have unusual physical circumstances, such as the American series Push Girls and Little People, Big World, and the British programmes Beyond Boundaries, Britain's Missing Top Model, The Undateables and Seven Dwarves.

Another example is shows that portray the lives of ethnic or religious minorities. Examples include All-American Muslim (Lebanese-American Muslims), Shahs of Sunset (affluent Persian-Americans), Sister Wives (polygamists from a Mormon splinter group), Breaking Amish and Amish Mafia (the Amish), and Big Fat Gypsy Weddings and its spinoffs (Romani people).

The Real Housewives franchise offers a window into the lives of social-striving urban and suburban housewives. Many shows focus on wealth and conspicuous consumption, including Platinum Weddings, and My Super Sweet 16, which documented huge coming of age celebrations thrown by wealthy parents. Conversely, the highly successful Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty are set in poorer rural areas of the Southern United States.

Some documentary-style shows portray professionals either going about day-to-day business or performing an entire project over the course of a series. One early example (and the longest running reality show of any genre) is Cops,[51] which debuted in 1989. Other such shows specifically relating to law enforcement include The First 48, Dog the Bounty Hunter, Police Stop!, Traffic Cops, Border Security and  Motorway Patrol.[52]

Shows set at a specific place of business include American Chopper, Miami Ink and its spinoffs, Bikini Barbershop and Lizard Lick Towing.

Shows that show people working in the same non-business location include Airport and Bondi Rescue.

Shows that portray a set of people in the same line of work, occasionally competing with each other, include Deadliest Catch, Ice Road Truckers and Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles and its spinoffs.

One notable subset of shows about professional activities is those in which the professionals haggle and engage in financial transactions, often over unique or rare items whose value must first be appraised. Two such shows, both of which have led to multiple spinoff shows, are Pawn Stars (about pawn shops) and American Pickers. Other shows, while based around such financial transactions, also show elements of its main cast members' personal and professional lives; these shows include Hardcore Pawn and Comic Book Men. Such shows have some antecedent in the British series Antiques Roadshow,[53] which began airing in 1979 and has since spawned numerous international versions, although that show includes only appraisals and does not include bargaining or other dramatic elements.

Some documentary-style programs place cast members, who in most cases previously did not know each other, in staged living environments; The Real World was the originator of this format. In almost every other such type of programming, cast members are given specific challenges or obstacles to overcome. Road Rules, which first aired in 1995 as a spin-off of The Real World, created a show structure where the cast would travel to various countries performing challenges for prizes.[citation needed]

Big Brother is probably the best-known program of this type in the world, with around 50 international versions having been produced. Other shows in this category, such as The 1900 House and Lads' Army, involve historical re-enactment, with cast members living and working as people of a specific time and place. 2001's Temptation Island achieved some notoriety by placing several couples on an island surrounded by single people in order to test the couples' commitment to each other. The Challenge has contestants living together in an overseas residence, and has been around for over 30 seasons. The format of each season changes, however the main premise of the series involves a daily challenge, nomination process and elimination round. U8TV: The Lofters combined the ""special living environment"" format with the ""professional activity"" format noted earlier; in addition to living together in a loft, each member of the show's cast was hired to host a television program for a Canadian cable channel.

The Simple Life, Tommy Lee Goes to College and The Surreal Life are all shows in which celebrities are put into an unnatural environment.

Originally, court shows were all dramatized and staged programs, with actors playing the litigants, witnesses and lawyers. The cases were either reenactments of real-life cases or cases that were fictionalized altogether. Among examples of staged courtroom dramas are Famous Jury Trials, Your Witness, and the first two eras of Divorce Court. The People's Court revolutionized the genre by introducing the arbitration-based ""reality"" format in 1981, later adopted by the vast majority of court shows. The genre experienced a lull in programming after The People's Court was canceled in 1993, but then soared after the emergence of Judge Judy in 1996. This led to a slew of other reality court shows, such as Judge Mathis, Judge Joe Brown, Judge Alex, Judge Mills Lane and Judge Hatchett.

Though the litigants are legitimate, the ""judges"" in such shows are actually arbitrators, as these pseudo-judges are not actually presiding in a court of law. Typically, however, they are retired judges or at least individuals who have had some legal experience.

Courtroom programs are typically daytime television shows that air on weekdays.

The globally syndicated format Dragons' Den shows a group of wealthy investors choosing whether or not to invest in a series of pitched startup companies and entrepreneurial ventures. The series Restaurant Startup similarly involves investors, but involves more of a game show element in which restaurant owners compete to prove their worth. The British series Show Me the Monet offers a twist in which artworks' artistic value, rather than their financial value, is appraised by a panel of judges, who determine whether each one will be featured at an exhibition.

Another subgenre places people in wild and challenging natural settings. This includes such shows as Survivorman, Man vs. Wild, Marooned with Ed Stafford, Naked and Afraid and Alaskan Bush People. The shows Survivor and Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls combine outdoor survival with a competition format, although in Survivor the competition also involves social dynamics.

Some reality television shows cover a person or group of people improving their lives. Sometimes the same group of people are covered over an entire season (as in The Swan and Celebrity Fit Club), but usually there is a new target for improvement in each episode. Despite differences in the content, the format is usually the same: first the show introduces the subjects in their current, less-than-ideal environment. Then the subjects meet with a group of experts, who give the subjects instructions on how to improve things; they offer aid and encouragement along the way. Finally, the subjects are placed back in their environment and they, along with their friends and family and the experts, appraise the changes that have occurred. Other self-improvement or makeover shows include The Biggest Loser, Extreme Weight Loss and Fat March (which cover weight loss), Extreme Makeover (entire physical appearance), Queer Eye, What Not to Wear, How Do I Look?,  Trinny & Susannah Undress... and Snog Marry Avoid? (style and grooming), Supernanny (child-rearing), Made (life transformation), Tool Academy (relationship building) and Charm School and From G's to Gents (self-improvement and manners).

The concept of self-improvement was taken to its extreme with the British show Life Laundry, in which people who had become hoarders, even living in squalor, were given professional assistance. The American television series Hoarders and Hoarding: Buried Alive follow similar premises, presenting interventions in the lives of people who suffer from compulsive hoarding. The British series Sort Your Life Out, presented by Stacey Solomon, is similar, but it also redesigns the participants' houses.

In one study, participants who admitted to watching more reality television were more likely to proceed with a desired plastic surgery than those who watched less.[54]

Some shows makeover part or all of a person's living space, workspace, or vehicle. The American series This Old House, which debuted in 1979, features the start-to-finish renovation of different houses through a season; media critic Jeff Jarvis has speculated that it is ""the original reality TV show.""[55] The British show Changing Rooms, beginning in 1996 (later remade in the U.S. as Trading Spaces) was the first such renovation show that added a game show feel with different weekly contestants.[citation needed]

House renovation shows are a mainstay on the American and Canadian cable channel HGTV, whose renovation shows include the successful franchises Flip or Flop, Love It or List It and Property Brothers, as well as shows such as Debbie Travis' Facelift, Designed to Sell  and Holmes on Homes. Non-HGTV shows in this category include Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and While You Were Out.

Pimp My Ride and Overhaulin' show vehicles being rebuilt in a customized way.

In some shows, one or more experts try to improve a failing small business over the course of each episode. Examples that cover many types of business include We Mean Business and The Profit. Shows geared for a specific type of business include Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and Restaurant: Impossible (for restaurants), Bar Rescue (for bars) and Hotel Hell (for hotels).

Another type of reality program is the social experiment that produces drama, conflict, and sometimes transformation. British TV series Wife Swap, which began in 2003, and has had many spinoffs in the UK and other countries, is a notable example. In the show, people with different values agree to live by each other's social rules for a brief period of time. Other shows in this category include Trading Spouses, Bad Girls Club and Holiday Showdown. Faking It was a series where people had to learn a new skill and pass themselves off as experts in that skill. Shattered was a controversial 2004 UK series in which contestants competed for how long they could go without sleep. Solitary was a controversial 2006-2010 Fox Reality series that isolated contestants for weeks in solitary confinement pods with limited sleep, food and information while competing in elimination challenges ended by a quit button, causing winners to go on for much longer than needed as a blind gamble to not be the first person to quit.

The Dutch series De Verraders, adapted internationally as The Traitors, features contestants divided into two factions—the ""traitors"" and the ""faithful""—and competing in challenges to build a cash jackpot awarded in the finale; three contestants secretly designated as ""traitors"" (which are known to the viewers) have the ability to secretly eliminate (""murder"") other contestants each night, while the remaining contestants try to figure out the identities of the traitors so they can attempt to ""banish"" them in elimination votes. The jackpot is split among the faithful if they eliminate all of the traitors, but is split among the traitors if they fail. 

Another type of reality programming features hidden cameras rolling when random passers-by encounter a staged situation. Candid Camera, which first aired on television in 1948, pioneered the format. Modern variants of this type of production include Punk'd, Trigger Happy TV, Primetime: What Would You Do?, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment and Just for Laughs Gags. The series Scare Tactics and Room 401 are hidden-camera programs in which the goal is to frighten contestants rather than just befuddle or amuse them. The Belgian hidden camera series Sorry voor alles subjects a contestant to various staged situations over a month-long period, designed to analyze their personality and how they respond. After the contestant is taken to a studio and let off the hook, they then answer observation questions related to the events for a chance to win prizes.[56]

Not all hidden camera shows use strictly staged situations. For example, the syndicated program Cheaters purports to use hidden cameras to record suspected cheating partners, although the authenticity of the show has been questioned, and even refuted by some who have been featured on the series.[57] Once the evidence has been gathered, the accuser confronts the cheating partner with the assistance of the host. In many special-living documentary programs, hidden cameras are set up all over the residence in order to capture moments missed by the regular camera crew, or intimate bedroom footage.

Supernatural and paranormal reality shows such as MTV's Fear, place participants into frightening situations which ostensibly involve paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, telekinesis or haunted houses. In series such as Celebrity Paranormal Project, the stated aim is investigation, and some series like Scariest Places on Earth challenge participants to survive the investigation; whereas others such as Paranormal State and Ghost Hunters use a recurring crew of paranormal researchers. In general, the shows follow similar stylized patterns of night vision, surveillance, and hand held camera footage; odd angles; subtitles establishing place and time; desaturated imagery; and non-melodic soundtracks. Noting the trend in reality shows that take the paranormal at face value, New York Times culture editor Mike Hale[58] characterized ghost hunting shows as ""pure theater"" and compared the genre to professional wrestling or softcore pornography for its formulaic, teasing approach.[59]

Another subgenre of reality television is ""reality competition"", ""reality playoffs"", or so-called ""reality game shows"", which follow the format of non-tournament elimination contests.[60] Typically, participants are filmed competing to win a prize, often while living together in a confined environment. In many cases, participants are removed until only one person or team remains, who is then declared the winner. Usually this is done by eliminating participants one at a time (or sometimes two at a time, as an episodic twist due to the number of contestants involved and the length of a given season), through either disapproval voting or by voting for the most popular to win. Voting is done by the viewing audience, the show's own participants, a panel of judges, or some combination of the three.

A well-known example of a reality-competition show is the globally syndicated Big Brother, in which cast members live together in the same house, with participants removed at regular intervals by either the viewing audience or, in the American version, by the participants themselves. There remains disagreement over whether talent-search shows such as the Idol series, the Got Talent series and the Dancing with the Stars series are truly reality television or just newer incarnations of shows such as Star Search. Although the shows involve a traditional talent search, the shows follow the reality-competition conventions of removing one or more contestants in every episode, allowing the public to vote on who is removed, and interspersing performances with video clips showing the contestants' ""back stories"", their thoughts about the competition, their rehearsals and unguarded behind-the-scenes moments. Additionally, there is a good deal of unscripted interaction shown between contestants and judges. The American Primetime Emmy Awards have nominated both American Idol and Dancing with the Stars for the Outstanding Reality-Competition Program Emmy.

Game shows like Weakest Link, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, American Gladiators and Deal or No Deal, which were popular in the 2000s, also lie in a gray area: like traditional game shows (e.g., The Price Is Right, Jeopardy!), the action takes place in an enclosed television studio over a short period of time; however, they have higher production values, more dramatic background music, and higher stakes than traditional shows (done either through putting contestants into physical danger or offering large cash prizes). In addition, there is more interaction between contestants and hosts, and in some cases, they feature reality-style contestant competition or elimination as well. These factors, as well as these shows' rise in global popularity at the same time as the arrival of the reality craze, have led to such shows often being grouped under both the reality television and game show umbrellas.[61]

There have been various hybrid reality-competition shows, like the worldwide-syndicated Star Academy, which combines the Big Brother and Idol formats, The Biggest Loser, which combines competition with the self-improvement format, and American Inventor, which uses the Idol format for products instead of people. Some reality shows that aired mostly during the early 2000s, such as Popstars, Making the Band and Project Greenlight, devoted the first part of the season to selecting a winner, and the second part to showing that person or group of people working on a project. 

Popular variants of the competition-based format include the following:

Dating-based competition shows follow a contestant choosing one out of a group of suitors. Over the course of either a single episode or an entire season, suitors are eliminated until only the contestant and the final suitor remains. In the early 2000s, this type of reality show dominated the other genres on the major U.S. networks. Examples include The Bachelor, its spin-off The Bachelorette, Temptation Island, Average Joe, Flavor of Love (a dating show featuring rapper Flavor Flav that led directly and indirectly to over 10 spinoffs), The Cougar and Love in the Wild. In Married by America, contestants were chosen by viewer voting. This is one of the older variants of the format; shows such as The Dating Game that date to the 1960s had similar premises (though each episode was self-contained, and not the serial format of more modern shows). One of the more recent hits was Farmer Wants a Wife.

In this category, the competition revolves around a skill that contestants were pre-screened for. Competitors perform a variety of tasks based on that skill, are judged, and are then kept or removed by a single expert or a panel of experts. The show is usually presented as a job search of some kind, in which the prize for the winner includes a contract to perform that kind of work and an undisclosed salary, although the award can simply be a sum of money and ancillary prizes, like a cover article in a magazine. The show also features judges who act as counselors, mediators and sometimes mentors to help contestants develop their skills further or perhaps decide their future position in the competition. Popstars, which debuted in 1999, may have been the first such show, while the Idol series has been the longest-running and, for most of its run, the most popular such franchise. The first job-search show which showed dramatic, unscripted situations may have been America's Next Top Model, which premiered in May 2003. Other examples include The Apprentice (which judges business skills); Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef and Top Chef (for chefs), The Great British Bake Off (for bakers), Shear Genius (for hair styling), Project Runway (for clothing design), Top Design and The Great Interior Design Challenge (for interior design), American Dream Builders (for home builders), Stylista (for fashion editors), Last Comic Standing (for comedians), I Know My Kid's a Star (for child performers), On the Lot (for filmmakers), RuPaul's Drag Race (for drag queens), The Shot (for fashion photographers), So You Think You Can Dance (for dancers), MuchMusic VJ Search and Food Network Star (for television hosts), Dream Job (for sportscasters), American Candidate (for aspiring politicians), Work of Art (for artists), Face Off (for prosthetic makeup artists), Ink Master and Best Ink (for tattoo artists), Platinum Hit (for songwriters), Top Shot (for marksmen) and The Tester (for game testers).

One notable subset, popular from approximately 2005 to 2012, consisted of shows in which the winner gets a specific part in a known film, television show, musical or performing group. Examples include Scream Queens (where the prize was a role in the Saw film series), The Glee Project (for a role on the television show Glee) and How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? (the lead role in a revival of the musical The Sound of Music). The most extreme prize for such a show may have been for one of the first such shows, 2005's Rock Star: INXS, where the winner became the lead singer of the rock band INXS. J.D. Fortune, who won the show, went on to be INXS's lead singer until 2011.

Some shows use the same format with celebrities: in this case, there is no expectation that the winner will continue this line of work, and prize winnings often go to charity. The most popular such shows have been the Dancing with the Stars and Dancing on Ice franchises. Other examples of celebrity competition programs include Deadline, Celebracadabra and Celebrity Apprentice.

Some job-related competition shows have a different set of contestants competing on every episode, and thus more closely resemble game shows, although the ""confessional"" commentary provided by contestants gives them a reality TV aspect. The 1993-1999 Japanese cooking competition Iron Chef could be considered an early example, although it does not include commentary by the participants, only by announcers and judges. Cooking competition shows with different contestants per episode that are considered reality shows include the Chopped, Come Dine with Me and Nailed It! franchises, along with Cupcake Wars, Cutthroat Kitchen, and Guy's Grocery Games.

Non-cooking competition shows with a similar format include Forged in Fire and The Butcher.

One concept pioneered by, and unique to, reality competition shows is the idea of immunity, in which a contestant can win the right to be exempt the next time contestants are eliminated from the show. Possibly the first instance of immunity in reality TV was on Survivor, which premiered in 1997 in Sweden as Expedition Robinson, before gaining international prominence after the American edition (titled Survivor) premiered in 2000. On that show, there are complex rules around immunity: a player can achieve it by winning challenges (either as a team in the tribal phase or individually in the merged phase), or, in more recent seasons, through finding a hidden totem. They can also pass on their immunity to someone else and in the latter case, they can keep their immunity secret from other players.[63] 
On most shows, immunity is quite a bit simpler: it is usually achieved by winning a task, often a relatively minor task during the first half of the episode; the announcement of immunity is made publicly and immunity is usually non-transferable. At some point in the season, immunity ceases to be available, and all contestants are susceptible to elimination. Competition shows that have featured immunity include the Apprentice, Big Brother, Biggest Loser, Top Model, Project Runway, Lego Masters, and Top Chef franchises. Immunity may come with additional power as well, such as in the American version of Big Brother where the winning contestant usually has influence over deciding who faces an elimination vote later in the week. In one Apprentice episode, a participant chose to waive his earned immunity and was immediately ""fired"" for giving up this ""powerful asset"".[64]

Sport-related reality shows can fall within the aforementioned sub-genres, either using it as the basis of competition, or by following sport as a profession:

Some reality shows aim to satirize and deconstruct the conventions and cliches of the genre for comedic effect; in such cases, a fictitious premise is usually presented to one or more of the participants, with the rest of the cast consisting of actors and other figures that are in on the joke.

The authenticity of reality television is often called into question by its detractors. The genre's title of ""reality"" is often criticized as being inaccurate because of claims that the genre frequently includes elements such as premeditated scripting (including a practice called ""soft-scripting""), acting, urgings from behind-the-scenes crew to create specified situations of adversity and drama, and misleading editing. It has often been described as ""scripting without paper"".

In many cases, the entire premise of the show is contrived, based around a competition or another unusual situation. Some shows have been accused of using fakery in order to create more compelling television, such as having premeditated storylines and in some cases feeding participants lines of dialogue, focusing only on participants' most outlandish behavior, and altering events through editing and re-shoots.[77][78]

Shows such as Survivor and Amazing Race that offer a monetary prize are regulated in the United States by federal ""game show"" law, 47 U.S.C. § 509, and are monitored during the filming by the legal staff and standards and practice staff of the parent network. These shows cannot be manipulated in any way that affects the outcome of the game. However, misleading editing does not fall into altering the fairness of the competition.

Reality television shows that have been accused of, or admitted to, deception include The Real World,[79][80][81] the American version of Survivor,[82] Joe Millionaire,[83] The Hills, A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila,[84] Hogan Knows Best,[85] Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,[86] The Bachelor and The Bachelorette,[87][88] Pawn Stars,[89] Storage Wars,[90] Squid Game: The Challenge and Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[91][92]

In contrast, critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Deadliest Catch as having ""brought old-school documentary sobriety to a genre more often known for shamelessness.""[93]

Reality television's global success has become, in the view of some analysts, an important political phenomenon. In some[quantify] authoritarian countries, reality-television voting has provided the first opportunity for many citizens to vote in any free and fair wide-scale ""elections"". In addition, the frankness of the settings on some reality shows presents situations that are often taboo in certain conservative cultures, like Star Academy Arab World, which began airing in 2003, and which shows male and female contestants living together.[94] A Pan-Arab version of Big Brother was cancelled in 2004 after less than two weeks on the air after a public outcry and street protests.[95] In 2004 journalist Matt Labash, noting both of these issues, wrote that ""the best hope of little Americas developing in the Middle East could be Arab-produced reality TV"".[96]

In 2007, Abu Dhabi TV began airing Million's Poet, a show featuring Pop Idol-style voting and elimination, but for the writing and oration of Arabic poetry. The show became popular in Arab countries, with around 18 million viewers,[97] partly because it was able to combine the excitement of reality television with a traditional, culturally relevant topic.[98] In April 2010, however, the show also became a subject of political controversy, when Hissa Hilal, a 43-year-old female Saudi competitor, read out a poem criticizing her country's Muslim clerics.[99] Both critics and the public reacted favorably to Hilal's poetry; she received the highest scores from the judges throughout the competition and came in third place overall.[97]

In India, in the summer of 2007, coverage of the third season of Indian Idol focused on the breaking down of cultural and socioeconomic barriers as the public rallied around the show's top two contestants.[26]

The Chinese singing competition Super Girl (a local imitation of Pop Idol) has similarly been cited[by whom?] for its political and cultural impact.[100] After the finale of the show's 2005 season drew an audience of around 400 million people, and eight million text-message votes, the state-run English-language newspaper Beijing Today ran the front-page headline: ""Is Super Girl a Force for Democracy?""[101] The Chinese government criticized the show, citing both its democratic nature and its excessive vulgarity, or ""worldliness"",[102] and in 2006 banned it outright.[103] It was later reintroduced[by whom?] in 2009, before being banned again in 2011. Super Girl has also been criticized by non-government commentators for creating seemingly impossible ideals that may be harmful to Chinese youth.[100]

In Indonesia, reality television shows have surpassed soap operas as the most-watched broadcast programs.[104] One popular program, Jika Aku Menjadi (""If I Were""), follows young, middle-class people as they are temporarily placed into lower-class life, where they learn to appreciate their circumstances back home by experiencing daily life for the less fortunate.[104] Critics have claimed that this and similar programs in Indonesia reinforce traditionally Western ideals of materialism and consumerism.[104] However, Eko Nugroho, reality-show producer and president of Dreamlight World Media, insists that these reality shows are not promoting American lifestyles but rather reaching people through their universal desires.[104]

Reality television has also received criticism in Britain and the United States for its ideological relationship with surveillance societies and consumerism. Writing in The New York Times in 2012, author Mark Andrejevic characterised the role of reality television in a post-9/11 society as the normalisation of surveillance in participatory monitoring, the ""logic of the emerging surveillance economy"", and in the promise of a societal self-image that is contrived.[105] An LSE paper by Nick Couldry associates reality television with neoliberalism, condemning the ritualised enactment and consumption of what must be legitimised for the society it serves.[106]

Reality television generally costs less to produce than scripted series.[citation needed]

VH1 executive vice president Michael Hirschorn wrote in 2007 that the plots and subject matters on reality television are more authentic and more engaging than in scripted dramas, writing that scripted network television ""remains dominated by variants on the police procedural... in which a stock group of characters (ethnically, sexually, and generationally diverse) grapples with endless versions of the same dilemma. The episodes have all the ritual predictability of Japanese Noh theater,"" while reality television is ""the liveliest genre on the set right now. It has engaged hot-button cultural issues – class, sex, race – that respectable television... rarely touches.""[107]

Television critic James Poniewozik wrote in 2008 that reality shows like Deadliest Catch and Ice Road Truckers showcase working-class people of the kind that ""used to be routine"" on scripted network television, but that became a rarity in the 2000s: ""The better to woo upscale viewers, TV has evicted its mechanics and dockworkers to collect higher rents from yuppies in coffeehouses.""[108]

In a 2021 interview, filmmaker Mike White (who had previously competed on The Amazing Race and Survivor) said that reality competition shows like Survivor accurately conveyed how, in real life, ""so much of self is situational"", so that, as circumstances change, ""the oppressed becomes the oppressor, the bully becomes the bullied."" In contrast, he felt that in scripted drama ""there's a lot of religiosity around humanity.""[109]

Reality television has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, at least for a short period. This is most notable in talent-search programs such as Idol and The X Factor, which have spawned music stars in many of the countries in which they have aired. Many other shows, however, have made mostly temporary celebrities out of their participants; some participants have then been able to parlay this fame into media and merchandising careers. Participants of non-talent-search programs who have had subsequent acting careers include Lilian Afegbai, Jacinda Barrett, Jamie Chung, Stephen Colletti, David Giuntoli, Vishal Karwal, NeNe Leakes and Angela Trimbur; though Barrett and Trimbur were already aspiring actresses when they appeared on reality television. Reality TV participants who have become television hosts and personalities include Nabilla Benattia, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Kristin Cavallari, Colby Donaldson, Raffaella Fico, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Katie Hopkins, Rebecca Jarvis, Jodie Marsh, Heidi Montag, Tiffany Pollard and Whitney Port; some of them have had acting careers as well. Reality TV participants who have become television personalities as well as successful entrepreneurs include Gemma Collins, Lauren Conrad, Jade Goody, Bethenny Frankel and Spencer Matthews. Several cast members of MTV's Jersey Shore have had lucrative endorsement deals, and in some cases their own product lines. Wrestlers Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin and David Otunga got their start on non-athletic reality shows.

In Australia, various reality TV personalities have later served as radio hosts, including Fitzy and Rachel Corbett from Big Brother,[110] Mick Newell from My Kitchen Rules,[111] Heather Maltman from The Bachelor,[112] and Sam Frost from The Bachelorette.[113][114]

Some reality-television alumni have parlayed their fame into paid public appearances.[115][116]

Several socialites, or children of famous parents, who were somewhat well known before they appeared on reality television shows have become much more famous as a result, including Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Kelly Osbourne, Kim Kardashian, and many of the rest of the Kardashian family.

Reality television personalities often get derided as ""Z-list celebrities"". Some have been lampooned for exploiting an undeserved ""15 minutes of fame"".[117] The Kardashian family is one such group of reality television personalities who were subject to this criticism in the 2010s,[117][118] Kim Kardashian in particular.[119]

Two international franchises, The Apprentice and Dragons' Den, are notable for having some of the business people who appeared there as judges and investors go on to win political office. The prime example is President of the United States Donald Trump: his stint as host of the original The Apprentice from 2004 to 2015 has been credited by some commentators as a factor in his political success, since it greatly increased his fame, and showcased him as a tough and experienced authority figure.[120] Lado Gurgenidze, who hosted the Georgian version of The Apprentice in 2005, was appointed Prime Minister of Georgia from 2007, and served until 2008. Harry Harkimo, who hosted the Finnish version of The Apprentice from 2009 to 2013, has been a member of the Parliament of Finland since 2015. João Doria, who hosted seasons 7-8 of the Brazilian version of The Apprentice, O Aprendiz, from 2010 to 2011, served as Mayor of São Paulo from 2017 to 2018,[121] and as Governor of São Paulo from 2018 to 2022. Bruno Bonnell, who hosted the short-lived French version of The Apprentice in 2015, was a member of France's National Assembly from 2017 to 2022.

Dragons' Den investors who have gone on to hold political office after appearing on their country's version of the program include Tommy Ahlers of Denmark, Nir Barkat of Israel, Anne Berner of Finland, Tomio Okamura of the Czech Republic, and Lencke Wischhusen of Germany.

In a rare case of a previously unknown reality television alumnus succeeding in the political arena, The Real World: Boston cast member Sean Duffy was a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin from 2010 to 2019.[122]

In 2006, four of the ten most popular programs among viewers under 17 were reality shows.[123] Studies have shown that young people emulate the behavior displayed on these programs, gathering much of their knowledge of the social world, particularly about consumer practices, from television.[100][124][125][126] Some critics have decried the positive representation of sexually objectified women in shows like The Girls Next Door.[127][128]

In 2007, according to the Learning and Skills Council, one in seven UK teenagers hoped to gain fame by appearing on reality television.[129]

A number of studies have tried to pinpoint the appeal of reality television.[130] Factors that have been cited in its appeal include personal identification with the onscreen participants; pure entertainment; diversion from scripted TV; vicarious participation;[131] a feeling of self-importance compared to onscreen participants;[132] enjoyment of competition;[132] and an appeal to voyeurism, especially given ""scenes which take place in private settings, contain nudity, or include gossip"".[133][134][135]

A 2012 survey by Today.com found that Americans who watch reality television regularly are more extroverted, more neurotic, and have lower self-esteem than those who do not.[136]

A number of fictional works since the 1940s have contained elements similar to elements of reality television. They tended to be set in a dystopian future, with subjects being recorded against their will and often involved violence.

Some scripted and written works have used reality television as a plot device:

A number of scripted television comedy and satire shows have adopted the format of the documentary-type reality television show, in ""mockumentary"" style. The first such show was the BBC series Operation Good Guys, which premiered in 1997. Arguably the best-known and most influential such show is the BBC's The Office (2001), which spawned numerous international remakes, including a successful American version. Other examples include People Like Us (BBC UK, 1998), The Games (ABC Australia, 1999), Trailer Park Boys (2001), Reno 911! (2003), The Naked Brothers Band (2006), Summer Heights High (2007), Parks and Recreation (2009), Modern Family (2009), Come Fly with Me (2010), Real Husbands of Hollywood (2013), Trial & Error (2017), Cut (2017) and Abbott Elementary (2021). The genre has even encompassed cartoons (Drawn Together (2004) and Total Drama (2007)) and a show about puppets (The Muppets, 2015).

Not all reality-television-style mockumentary series are comedic: the 2013 American series Siberia has a science fiction-horror bent, while the 2014 Dutch series The First Years is a drama.

The 2013–2015 American sketch comedy series Kroll Show set most of its sketches as excerpts from various fictional reality television shows, which one critic wrote ""aren't far off from the lineups at E!, Bravo, and VH1"", and parodied those shows' participants' ""lack of self-awareness"".[144] The show also satirized the often incestuous nature of reality television, in which some series lead to a cascade of spinoffs. Kroll Show executive producer John Levenstein said in an interview that reality TV ""has so many tools for telling stories in terms of text and flashbacks and ways to show things to the audience that it's incredibly convenient for comedy and storytelling if you use the full reality show toolkit.""[145]

Some feature films have been produced that use some of the conventions of reality television; such films are sometimes referred to as reality films, and sometimes simply as documentaries.[146] Allen Funt's 1970 hidden camera movie What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? was based on his reality-television show Candid Camera. The series Jackass spawned five feature films, starting with Jackass: The Movie in 2002. A similar Finnish show, The Dudesons, was adapted for the film The Dudesons Movie, and a similar British show, Dirty Sanchez, was adapted for Dirty Sanchez: The Movie, both in 2006. The producers of The Real World created The Real Cancun in 2003. The Chinese reality show Keep Running was adapted for the 2015 film Running Man.

The 2003 BBC film The Other Boleyn Girl incorporated reality TV-style confessionals in which the two main characters talked directly to the camera.[147]

In 2007, broadcaster Krishnan Guru-Murthy stated that reality television is ""a firm and embedded part of television's vocabulary, used in every genre from game-shows and drama to news and current affairs.""[148]

The mumblecore film genre, which began in the mid-2000s, and uses video cameras and relies heavily on improvisation and non-professional actors, has been described as influenced in part by what one critic called ""the spring-break psychodrama of MTV's The Real World"". Mumblecore director Joe Swanberg has said, ""As annoying as reality TV is, it's been really good for filmmakers because it got mainstream audiences used to watching shaky camerawork and different kinds of situations.""[149]

Reality TV emerged in the early 1990s with shows like The Real World, gaining prominence in the 2000s with global franchises such as Survivor, Idol, and Big Brother. These programs often feature unscripted real-life situations and confessionals where cast members provide context for events. Despite its popularity, reality TV has faced criticism for not accurately reflecting reality, misleading editing, and exploiting participants. Historical precedents include Allen Funt's Candid Camera from 1948 and various game shows from the 1950s. The genre expanded globally in the late 1990s and early 2000s with numerous adaptations of popular formats. Specialist skill-based competitions also became popular during this period. Reality TV's influence extends to political phenomena in authoritarian countries, providing citizens opportunities to vote in free elections through show participation. The genre has been criticized for promoting surveillance societies and consumerism but praised for engaging cultural issues often ignored by scripted television.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the meeting\n- Quick greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives\n- Setting expectations for spontaneous discussion"", ""Scene 2: Project Progress Update\nTLDR: Discuss recent developments in reality TV projects\n- Television Producer shares updates on current projects\n- Reality TV Show Participant provides insights from recent experiences\n- Open floor for questions and comments"", ""Scene 3: Historical Context of Reality TV\nTLDR: Explore the evolution of reality TV from its origins to present day\n- Television Historian presents historical background and key milestones\n- Media Critic adds perspective on genre development and impact\n- Spontaneous contributions from other participants"", ""Scene 4: Criticism and Challenges in Reality TV\nTLDR: Address criticisms related to reality TV\u2019s authenticity, editing, and participant exploitation\n- Media Critic discusses common criticisms with examples\n- Psychologist analyzes psychological impacts on participants and viewers\n- Open discussion with personal experiences shared by Reality TV Show Participant"", ""Scene 5: Global Influence of Reality TV\nTLDR: Examine how reality TV has shaped cultural issues globally, including political phenomena in authoritarian countries\n- Television Producer highlights global adaptations and their success stories\n- Television Historian provides context on international influence and adaptations\n- Open floor for spontaneous contributions"", ""Scene 6: Stakeholder Feedback Session\nTLDR: Gather feedback from stakeholders to ensure alignment with project goals and expectations \n - Open discussion inviting all participants to share thoughts \n - Collect valuable feedback on current projects \n - Address any concerns or suggestions raised by stakeholders"", ""Scene 7: Closing Remarks \n TLDR : Summarize key points discussed , outline next steps , thank participants \n - Summary of main takeaways from the meeting \n - Outline action items moving forward \n - Thank everyone for their contributions""]",">>Television Producer: Hey everyone, let's get started with today's meeting.
>>Media Critic: Hi everyone, looking forward to our discussion on reality TV.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Hey everyone! Reality TV has been a wild ride for me with crazy challenges and unexpected friendships. Excited for today's discussion!
>>Television Historian: You know, reality TV actually has roots in early shows like Candid Camera and Queen for a Day—those were groundbreaking in their unscripted formats.
>>Psychologist: Reality TV often puts people in controlled environments which can really change their behavior due to stress and competition. What do you all think about this?
>>Television Producer: Well said! And speaking of stress—
[Phone rings loudly]
>>Media Critic: Oh dear, sorry about that—let me just silence my phone.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: No worries! We've all been there. 
 >>Television Producer: So, let's dive into the latest updates on our reality TV projects. We've got some exciting developments! The new season of 'Survivor' is wrapping up production, and we've introduced a few twists that are sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. What do you think?
>>Media Critic: I get that twists can boost engagement, but they might also turn off long-time fans who like the traditional format. How do you see this playing out?
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Well, um, from my experience on reality TV, those twists can really shake things up! They keep us participants guessing and add a whole new level of strategy. Trust me, these unexpected changes force us to adapt quickly and think on our feet.
>>Psychologist: You know, from a psychological perspective, these twists can indeed have profound effects on both participants and viewers. These unexpected changes can heighten stress levels among contestants—
>>Television Producer: Sorry to interrupt—could you clarify how these stress levels impact contestant behavior? 
>>Psychologist: Sure! High stress levels lead to stronger emotional reactions and strategic moves among contestants. For viewers, it makes for an engaging experience but can also split opinions on the show's format.
>>Television Producer: Well, twists are what keep the show fresh and unpredictable! Viewers love the suspense and drama. It's all about balancing innovation with tradition. Thoughts?
>>Media Critic: Moreover, while twists can invigorate the format, they must be carefully balanced to avoid undermining the show's core appeal. Too many changes can dilute what made 'Survivor' compelling in the first place.
>>(Phone rings loudly)
>>(Everyone pauses for a moment)
>>(Phone stops ringing)
>>Television Historian: Sorry about that—anyway, shows like 'Candid Camera' introduced unexpected twists that captivated audiences. These elements are crucial for maintaining viewer interest over time.
>>(Producer's phone vibrates again)
>>(Producer quickly silences it)
>>Producer: Apologies for that—technology never cooperates when you need it most!
>>Reality TV Show Participant: No worries! As I was saying... those unexpected changes force us to adapt quickly and think on our feet. You won't believe how much strategy goes into it! 
 >>Television Historian: You know, reality TV has evolved significantly since its inception. In the early days of television, shows like 'Candid Camera' and 'Queen for a Day' laid the groundwork for what we now recognize as reality programming. These programs introduced audiences to unscripted scenarios and real-life reactions, which were quite revolutionary at the time.
>>Media Critic: Absolutely. The genre's evolution has been marked by significant milestones that have shaped its current form. Shows like 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother' introduced competitive elements and audience participation, fundamentally altering viewer engagement. But do you think these competitive elements sometimes compromise authenticity?
>>Reality TV Show Participant: That's a good point! Being on 'Survivor' was crazy! The competition really pushes you to your limits, and having the audience involved makes it even more intense. You definitely feel pressure to be genuine while also playing the game.
>>Television Producer: Reality TV has come a long way since 'Candid Camera' and 'Queen for a Day'. From a production standpoint, managing these competitive elements is challenging but rewarding. It's amazing how these twists keep viewers on their toes.
>>Psychologist: From a psychological standpoint, being on shows like 'Survivor' can be really stressful for participants, changing how they behave and cope with situations. Plus, audience participation often creates a sense of connection but raises ethical questions about manipulating real-life emotions for entertainment.
>>Television Historian: Indeed! Shows like 'The Real World' introduced social dynamics that were previously unseen in reality TV, reflecting broader societal changes. This evolution mirrors technological advancements shaping how we consume media today.
>>Media Critic: Right! The genre's ability to adapt with elements like audience participation and competitive dynamics has kept it relevant. However, one must critically evaluate whether these changes have compromised authenticity or ethical standards.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Wow! You know, the authenticity debate is always hot. I mean, being on 'Survivor', you feel pressure to be genuine while playing the game. Can you imagine how that impacts what viewers see?
>>Television Producer: Reality TV's evolution is like a rollercoaster ride! The twists keep viewers glued to their screens. But are we sacrificing authenticity for entertainment? What do you think? 
 >>Media Critic: Reality TV blurs fiction and reality, making it captivating but often misleading. The editing can twist the truth and exploit participants for entertainment. What do you all think?
>>Psychologist: Absolutely, this manipulation can cause stress and anxiety for participants who feel misrepresented. It also affects viewers, giving them distorted perceptions of reality.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: From my time on the show, I saw firsthand how editing can make a simple disagreement look like a huge fight. One time, they made me look like the bad guy just because I was having a rough day!
>>Television Producer: Editing is definitely tricky! We aim to keep things real but there's always pressure to keep viewers hooked. Sometimes that means adding drama where there isn't any.
>>Media Critic: This manipulation not only distorts viewers' perceptions but also raises ethical concerns about exploiting participants' vulnerabilities.
>>Television Historian: Early shows like 'Candid Camera' started this trend of blending reality with entertainment. It's evolved over time but still raises questions about ethics and authenticity.
>>Television Producer: True, we've come a long way since then. But balancing authenticity with viewer engagement is tough—sometimes we have to spice things up to keep people watching.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Yeah, it's crazy how they can twist things around. Once, they edited out all the context from an argument I had with another participant—it looked way worse than it actually was!
>>Television Historian: The evolution of reality TV has always been about finding that balance between genuine reactions and engaging narratives.
>>Media Critic: And these ethical concerns aren't just about the participants—they affect society too. When viewers see a distorted version of reality, it skews their expectations in real life.
>>Television Producer: Exactly! We try to be fair in our editing but sometimes it's like walking a tightrope between keeping it real and keeping it entertaining.
>>Psychologist: Manipulating reality through editing can lead to significant mental health challenges for participants—they might feel betrayed or misrepresented causing stress or anxiety—and viewers risk developing unrealistic expectations based on these portrayals. 
 >>Television Historian: You know, reality TV has not only influenced individual perceptions but also societal norms on a global scale. In the early days of television, shows like 'Candid Camera' and 'Queen for a Day' were groundbreaking in their ability to capture real-life reactions and emotions. These programs laid the foundation for modern reality TV by demonstrating the power of unscripted content to engage audiences.
>>Television Producer: Well, reality TV has certainly made waves globally! Take 'Survivor,' for instance. It's not just a hit in the U.S.; it's been adapted in over 50 countries! These adaptations often reflect local cultures and norms while maintaining the core elements of competition and survival.
>>Media Critic: Reality TV's influence extends beyond mere entertainment; it has become a cultural phenomenon that shapes societal norms and even political landscapes. Shows like 'Survivor' often touch on important topics relevant to different regions. What are your thoughts on this?
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Um, you know, being part of a reality show really opened my eyes! I mean, when you're in it, you see how these shows can reflect and even challenge cultural norms. Like during my time on the show, there were moments that made me think about how we portray ourselves and our values to the world. For example, there was this one challenge where we had to work together despite our differences—it really highlighted how cooperation is valued differently across cultures.
>>Television Producer: So true! Reality TV's global adaptations are like a cultural mirror, reflecting and sometimes challenging societal norms. It's fascinating how shows like 'Survivor' can adapt to local cultures while still maintaining their core competitive spirit.
>>Media Critic: Absolutely! And critically speaking, these adaptations often serve as platforms for viewers to engage with important issues indirectly under the guise of entertainment.
>>Psychologist: From a psychological perspective, reality TV can act as a catalyst for societal reflection, especially where open discourse is limited. These shows often provide viewers with an indirect way to engage with cultural norms and political dynamics. It's fascinating how entertainment can subtly influence public perception.
>>Television Producer: Well said! It's amazing how reality TV can sneak in these subtle messages about society and politics without people even realizing it!
>>Reality TV Show Participant: Yeah! And honestly, when you're part of it, you see firsthand how even small interactions can reflect bigger issues—like being part of this huge global conversation without realizing it!
>>Television Historian: Moreover, these adaptations serve as subtle forms of resistance where open political discourse is stifled. They provide platforms for viewers to engage with cultural norms indirectly under the guise of entertainment. 
 >>Reality TV Show Participant: Well, you know, from my experience on reality TV, the editing can really twist things around. It's all about finding that balance between staying true to yourself and keeping the audience entertained.
>>Television Producer: So, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. What specific feedback do you have on the current season's format? Any particular twists or elements that you think need tweaking?
>>Media Critic: The current season's format seems to lack coherence in terms of narrative structure. The twists introduced appear more gimmicky than substantial, potentially alienating long-time viewers who appreciate a consistent storyline. What are your thoughts on this?
>>Showrunner: Reality TV has always been about adapting to audience expectations while maintaining authenticity. Maybe we should consider how past formats have successfully balanced these elements and apply those lessons to our current projects.
>>Television Producer: Right, it's crucial we address the narrative structure concerns. Maybe we can tweak the format to ensure it aligns better with audience expectations while keeping it fresh and engaging.
>>Audience Analyst: From a psychological perspective, the narrative structure can significantly impact viewer engagement and emotional investment. When the storyline lacks coherence, it might lead to a disconnect not only for viewers but also for participants who struggle to find their place within the narrative.
>>Reality TV Show Participant: From my time on reality TV, I can tell you that when the story keeps changing, it's hard for participants to feel connected. For example, during one season I was part of, constant changes made it tough for us to understand our roles and stay engaged.
>>Media Critic: Exactly! Without a coherent storyline, viewers might feel disconnected from the content too. Revisiting successful formats from past seasons could provide valuable insights into crafting a more compelling narrative. Remember Season 3? It had a clear progression and kept viewers hooked throughout.
>>Showrunner: Successful formats often blend innovation with tradition. By revisiting past successes like Season 3 or even Season 5 where we had strong character arcs combined with unexpected twists, we can ensure our current projects resonate with audiences while maintaining authenticity.
>>Television Producer: So it seems like we need to address the narrative structure and make sure it's not just gimmicky but actually engaging for our audience. Looking at past successful formats like Season 3 could help us identify what elements worked well.
>>Audience Analyst: Indeed! It's important to consider how these narrative shifts impact both viewers and participants mentally. When there's no clear storyline, it can lead to confusion and stress for everyone involved. 
 >>Television Producer: Well, we've covered a lot today! From the historical roots of reality TV to its psychological impacts and production challenges. I mean, balancing authenticity with entertainment is no easy feat, but it's crucial for keeping viewers engaged. Let's make it happen moving forward!

>>Media Critic: You see, maintaining viewer engagement while ensuring ethical standards in reality TV is indeed a delicate dance. How do you think we can better ensure ethical standards without losing viewer interest?

>>Reality TV Show Participant: Um, you know, from my experience on reality TV—oh wait, sorry to interrupt—did anyone else hear that notification sound? I think someone's phone might be going off.

>>Television Historian: Oops, sorry about that! Anyway... As I was saying—from a historical perspective...

>>Reality TV Show Participant: Right! So as I was saying, from what I've seen, it's really about showing real moments but also making sure there's enough excitement to keep people watching. Trust me on this!

>>Television Historian: Actually, the genre's roots in shows like 'Candid Camera' and 'Queen for a Day' set the stage for this ongoing challenge. As we move forward, maintaining this balance will be crucial to ensure both viewer engagement and ethical standards.

>>Psychologist: Moreover, um, it's crucial to recognize the psychological impact of reality TV on both participants and viewers. The stress and competition can lead to significant behavioral changes affecting mental well-being. Given the stress involved, perhaps we should consider providing support resources for participants during filming.

>>Television Producer: So as we wrap up—thanks everyone for your insights today—it's been amazing! Let's schedule a follow-up meeting next week to discuss how we can implement these ideas into our upcoming projects."
