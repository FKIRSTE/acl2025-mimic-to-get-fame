Fashion Week,"A fashion week is a week-long fashion industry event where fashion designers, brands, or ""houses"" display their latest collections in runway fashion shows to buyers and the media which influences upcoming fashion trends for the current and approaching seasons.[1][2]

The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the fashion capitals of the world—in chronological order, New York City, London, Milan, and Paris, or the ""Big Four"".[3] The consecutive fashion weeks of the Big Four are referred to as fashion month.[4]

The foundations of fashion week began in Paris in the late 1800s before spreading to New York, Milan, and London in the 20th century. What began as marketing garments in public spaces like racetracks grew into highly publicized events in themselves.[5][6] In the 2000s, themes of sustainability began emerging at fashion weeks and grew popular across the next decade.[7]

Fashion weeks in recent years have reflected a faster ""retail cycle"" with ""see now, buy-now"" and ""in-season"" fashion shows.[8][9] Event organizers have proposed combining the collections for one season or men and women's wear shows to reduce the carbon emissions associated with these events.[10]

One of history's first signs of a fashion week, or seasonal collection, can be traced back to fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth during the late 1800s. The concept of the fashion week began in Paris, when marketers used to hire women to wear couture items in public places, from racetracks to beauty salons.[5] These parades gradually became social events of their own. In France, runway shows are still called ""défilés de mode"" which when translated literally means ""fashion shows"" or ""fashion parades."" A style show is an occasion placed on by a style planner to exhibit their forthcoming line of dress as well as embellishments during Fashion Week. Style shows debut each season, especially the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons.[6]

The first Paris Fashion Week was due to the work of designer Paul Poiret. Poiret was known as the King of Fashion and led the fashion world in the first decade of the 20th century. He wished to present his designs on live mobile bodies. Poiret decided that to make this idea a reality he would combine socializing and shopping by throwing multiple galas featuring his pieces. Guests were asked to dress in their best clothing to align with his lavish designs. As the shows continued they became less of a large affair and the invitations became more individualized. Fashion week houses began to dress models in their collections in front of client-only guests. Unlike modern-day fashion shows photographers were prohibited due to tensions regarding copied designs.

The formation of the Fédération Française de la Couture marked the first official Paris Fashion Week in 1973. The show opened with the tension-building Battle of Versailles Fashion Show that displayed the famed battle between Paris and New York Fashion. The battle was set between five of the top French designers and five American designers with no famous backing.[11]

In 1903, a Manhattan shop called Ehrich Brothers put on what is thought to have been the country's first fashion show to lure middle-class women into the store.[6] By 1910, many big department stores were holding shows of their own. It is likely that American retailers saw the ""fashion parades"" in couture salons and decided to use the idea. These ""parades"" effectively promoted stores and improved their status. By the 1920s, the fashion show had been used by retailers across the country. They were staged, and often held in the shop's restaurant during lunch or teatime. These shows were usually more theatrical than those of today, heavily based upon a single theme, and accompanied by a narrative commentary.

On July 19 in 1943, the first-ever ""fashion week,"" New York Fashion Week, was held to give fashion buyers alternatives to French fashion during World War II, when workers in the fashion industry were unable to travel to Paris. Fashion shows were hugely popular, enticing crowds in their thousands – crowds so large, that stores in New York in the 1950s had to obtain a license to have live models.[12] Until 1994, shows were held in different locations, such as hotels, or lofts. From 1994 to 2009, the event was held in a tent at Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library. Lincoln Center was the Fashion Week venue from 2010 to 2015,[13] after which it moved to Clarkson Square, an events venue in SoHo in Manhattan.[14] After 2017, Clarkson Square was abandoned for a decentralized format.[15]

Before mainstream fashion events like fashion week began incorporating sustainable fashion, brands like Patagonia practiced sustainability by designing garments out of recycled materials. The Copenhagen Fashion Summit was then established in 2009 to discuss social and environmental issues facing the fashion industry. Designers were called on to cut their total number of collections per year in exchange for more durable garments which extended lifespan and minimized waste.[7] Similarly, buyers were encouraged to purchase fewer longer lasting pieces. These informal initiatives stimulate a circular economy.[16]

In 2014, the Connect4Climate trust fund (owned by the World Bank Group)financed the “Sustainability Dialogues in the Design Industry” initiative at Milan Fashion Week to create opportunities for pioneering young designers. At London Fashion Week in 2017, Vivienne Westwood and the Mayor of London created the ""Fashion Switch"" initiative to support UK brands transitioning to renewable energy.[7] In Asia, mindful fashion and conscious designer labels were promoted at Lakme Fashion Week 2018.[2] Connect4Climate also launched “X-Ray Fashion,” a virtual reality experience exploring the relationship between climate change and the fashion industry. In the next year, brands like H&M, Burberry, and Zara followed in Patagonia’s footsteps and started producing garments with sustainably sourced materials.[7]

In 2019, initiatives like the “Fashion Pact” and “Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action” articulated goals for the fashion industry around green energy, material use, and supply chain modernization to reduce carbon emissions.[7] At London Fashion Week, the British Fashion Council promoted upcycling and remanufacturing by featuring new sustainable brands in designer showrooms.[2] Influential brands like Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana showcased sustainable design in the Spring and Summer 2020 collections as well.[7] The same year, Gabriella Hearst organized New York Fashion Week’s first carbon neutral fashion show. She offset emissions, booked models already in the area, and hired caterers who used local ingredients.[17] In May, designer Richard Marlone won the 2020 International Woolmark Prize for his radical ideas in sustainable development. Lakme Fashion Week also launched the Circular Design Challenge, the first sustainable fashion award in India.[2]

Since 2021, advocacy groups have both attended and disrupted London Fashion Week and other major shows while calling for environmental and labor protections in the fashion industry.[7][18] Organizers of Copenhagen Fashion Week 2023 set 18 minimum standards for the brands participating, an unprecedented decision. For example, seat cards and set pieces had to be recyclable, fur on garments was banned, and designs had to be 50% recycled material. Implementation of these rules was left up to the interpretation of designers, resulting in some variation due to the phrasing. Fashion week executives framed the standards as a transitional step to fully sustainable collections.[19]

Although there are many notable fashion weeks around the world, only four are known as the ""Big Four"": in chronological order, New York, London, Milan, and Paris.[20][21][3]  Paris began holding couture shows in 1945,[22] Milan Fashion Week was founded by the Italian Chamber of Commerce in 1958,[23] Paris Fashion Week was further organized in 1973 under the French Fashion Federation,[24] and London Fashion Week was founded by the British Fashion Council in 1984.[25]  Although these key organizations still organize the main shows, there are independent events and producers in all cities, as well.[1] Other notable fashion weeks are held in Copenhagen, Berlin, Madrid, São Paulo, Shanghai, and Tokyo.[19][26]

The ""Big Four"" refers to fashion weeks which happen twice a year in the major fashion capitals of the world; New York, London, Milan, and Paris.[27]

Traditionally, fashion weeks were held several months in advance of the season to allow the press and buyers a chance to preview fashion designs for the following season. In February and March, designers showcased their autumn and winter collections. In September and October, designers showcased their spring and summer collections.

This timing was largely created to follow the then slower ""retail cycle."" In other words, it allowed time for retailers to purchase and incorporate the designers into their retail marketing. However, as customer expectations have increased, the retail cycle has increased. As a result, in 2016, designers started moving to ""in-season shows.""[9]

In recent years, shows have begun to feature garments that are available for sale immediately, online or in stores.[28] The other move has been to ""see now, buy now"" shows, often featuring clickable video, where looks are available online immediately following, or even during the show.[8] ""See now, buy now"" experiences have included shows from Tom Ford, Nicole Miller, Moschino and Tommy Hilfiger. In the 2019 Tommy x Zendaya show, Hilfiger commented on the innovation of the ""see now, buy now"" concept.[29] However, the French Federation of Fashion has not accepted the call to incorporate it as of 2017.[30] The advent of ""see now, buy now"" shopping has also come about in response to so-called ""fast fashion"" retailers, who copy designs from the runway and bring them to retail faster than traditional design houses.[31][32]

Since fashion weeks were established, approximately 241,000 tons of CO2 have been released each year from attending the ""Big Four"" and major trade shows. Buyers and sellers generate emissions and waste from air travel, accommodations, ground transportation, and fashion shows. 37% of total CO2 emissions are attributed to New York Fashion Week. The carbon footprint of the average global citizen is a fraction of the average professional buyer's from traveling approximately 19,213 km every year. On flights in business class, they generate up to 30% more CO2 emissions per person if the ratio of business seats to economy seats in each plane is taken into consideration.[33][10] It is unrealistic for event organizers to ask guests to fly in economy class, take trains, or share accommodation, but paper invitations and plastic water bottles at events have become obsolete. Organizers for fashion week and other major events have also proposed combining all the collections for one season, displaying men and women’s wear at the same event, and establishing fashion “districts” in fashion capitals like New York to minimize traffic congestion during fashion week.[10] Practicing sustainability at fashion week encourages sustainable development in the fashion industry because it reflects and influences major trends and market demand.[2]

Fashion Week began in Paris in the late 1800s as public garment displays and evolved into major events held in New York, London, Milan, and Paris—the ""Big Four."" These events influence fashion trends for upcoming seasons. The first official Paris Fashion Week was organized in 1973 by the Fédération Française de la Couture. Sustainability has become a key theme since the 2000s, with initiatives like ""Fashion Switch"" promoting renewable energy use among UK brands. Recent years have seen a shift towards faster retail cycles with ""see now, buy now"" shows allowing immediate purchase of showcased garments. Despite this trend, traditional organizations like the French Federation of Fashion have not fully embraced it. Concerns about carbon emissions from travel to these events have led to proposals for combining collections or establishing fashion districts to reduce environmental impact. Copenhagen Fashion Week set new standards for sustainable practices in 2023. The meeting concluded with an acknowledgment of ongoing efforts to balance innovation with sustainability in the fashion industry.","[""Scene 1: Warm Welcome\nTLDR: Brief greetings and setting a relaxed tone for the catch-up.\n- Exchange quick hellos and light-hearted remarks\n- Acknowledge familiarity among participants\n- Set expectations for a casual, open discussion"", ""Scene 2: Fashion Week Origins\nTLDR: Discuss the historical beginnings of Fashion Week and its evolution.\n- Fashion Historian shares insights on Paris origins\n- Explore cultural impacts over time\n- Encourage anecdotes from past events"", ""Scene 3: The Big Four Capitals\nTLDR: Examine the significance of New York, London, Milan, and Paris in fashion.\n- Discuss each city's unique contribution to fashion trends\n- Share personal experiences attending these events\n- Allow spontaneous comparisons between cities"", ""Scene 4: Sustainability Efforts in Fashion\nTLDR: Delve into sustainability initiatives within the industry.\n- Sustainability Advocate highlights key efforts like \""Fashion Switch\""\n- Discuss Copenhagen Fashion Week's standards in 2023\n- Open floor for ideas on improving sustainability practices"", ""Scene 5: See Now, Buy Now Trend\nTLDR: Analyze the impact of immediate retail cycles on traditional practices.\n- Fashion Industry Analyst presents data-driven insights on market shifts\n- Debate pros and cons of \""see now, buy now\"" approach\n- Invite personal opinions on future trends"", ""Scene 6: Balancing Innovation with Tradition\nTLDR: Explore how innovation can coexist with traditional fashion values.\n- Fashion Designer shares creative perspectives on blending old and new styles\n- Discuss challenges faced by designers today\n- Encourage sharing of innovative ideas or projects"", ""Scene 7: Off-topic Moments & Personal Insights\nTLDR: Allow space for non-work-related discussions and personal stories.\n- Share amusing anecdotes or recent experiences unrelated to work \n- Foster team rapport through light-hearted exchanges \n - Encourage spontaneous contributions from all participants""]",">>Fashion Designer: Hey everyone! It's been a while, hasn't it? How's everyone doing?
>>Fashion Historian: Hi there! Great to see you all again. Historically speaking, fashion weeks started as simple marketing strategies but have transformed into cultural phenomena that reflect societal changes.
>>Sustainability Advocate: Absolutely! And it's amazing to think about how we can use these events to promote sustainability within the industry.
>>Fashion Designer: Yeah, totally agree with you. It's incredible how much impact these events have on setting trends and pushing boundaries creatively.
>>Fashion Industry Analyst: To be honest, these gatherings really show how fashion weeks drive economic trends. The 'Big Four' alone generate significant revenue and influence consumer spending patterns globally.
>>Fashion Historian: Speaking of impact, it's fascinating how these gatherings not only showcase creativity but also influence global trends and consumer behavior!
>>Sustainability Advocate: Exactly! And every time we meet like this, I feel like we're taking steps towards making 'green the new black.' 
 >>Fashion Historian: You know, the origins of Fashion Week can be traced back to Paris in the late 1800s. It started with showcasing couture items in public spaces like racetracks and beauty salons. Isn't it amazing how these events have evolved into influential platforms for social change and artistic expression?
>>Fashion Designer: Picture it, the racetracks and beauty salons of Paris bustling with couture parades! It's like fashion was always meant to be a spectacle. What if we tried something new by blending these historical roots with modern innovation?
>>Sustainability Advocate: That's an interesting idea! Imagine transforming those venues into eco-friendly spaces, showcasing collections made from recycled materials. How do you think we could implement that practically?
>>Fashion Industry Analyst: According to the data, fashion weeks have evolved significantly from their origins in Paris. These events now generate billions in revenue annually. But how can we leverage this economic power to drive sustainable practices within the industry?
>>Fashion Historian: The transformation of Fashion Week is truly remarkable. These events have shaped cultural identities over time and become platforms for artistic expression.
>>Sustainability Advocate: Well, it's not just about glamour and revenue. If every major fashion event prioritized sustainability, reducing carbon footprints and promoting eco-friendly practices, it could make a huge difference.
>>Fashion Designer: Blending historical grandeur with today's digital innovation sounds exciting! What if we created virtual fashion parades that capture the essence of those early spectacles while reaching a global audience? 
>>Sustainability Advocate: Great question! We could start by partnering with tech companies to develop immersive virtual experiences that highlight sustainable fashion.
>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Statistically speaking, the economic impact of Fashion Week is undeniable. These events generate billions annually, influencing consumer behavior and driving market trends. How does this affect sustainability practices within the industry?
>>Fashion Historian: Interestingly, these events have also mirrored societal changes over time. They've evolved into platforms for artistic expression and social commentary.
>>Sustainability Advocate: Transforming traditional venues into symbols of eco-conscious fashion evolution would be a unique approach. What would be our first step towards making this happen? 
 >>Fashion Historian: You know, the historical significance of these cities in shaping global fashion trends is truly fascinating! Have you ever wondered why Paris remains the epitome of haute couture while Milan exudes luxury craftsmanship? I recall attending a show in Milan where the attention to detail was simply breathtaking—it's like stepping into a world where every stitch tells a story.

>>Fashion Designer: Imagine this, attending New York Fashion Week and feeling the electric energy of innovation in every show! It's like the city itself breathes creativity into each collection. And then there's Milan—oh, the craftsmanship! I remember a show where every piece felt like a masterpiece, meticulously crafted with such elegance.

>>Sustainability Advocate: Well, attending London Fashion Week was quite an eye-opener for me. The city's rebellious spirit and innovative designs were everywhere! But what if we could channel that energy into sustainable practices? Every step counts towards making a difference.

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Let's see... According to data, New York Fashion Week generates approximately 37% of total CO2 emissions among the Big Four. Statistically speaking—

>>Fashion Designer (interrupting): Wait, did you say 37%? That's pretty high!

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Yes, it is significant considering all the travel and logistics involved. How does this affect consumer behavior?

>>Fashion Historian: Historically speaking, Paris has always been at the heart of haute couture since Charles Frederick Worth's time in the late 1800s. Speaking of Milan's craftsmanship, it's not just about luxury; it's about preserving traditions that have been passed down through generations. I remember attending a show there where each garment seemed to tell its own story through intricate details and luxurious fabrics.

>>(Phone notification sound interrupts)

>>Sustainability Advocate (smiling): Oops! Sorry about that; my phone seems more interested in fashion than I am right now!

>>(Everyone chuckles lightly)

>>Fashion Historian (continuing): Anyway...the way these cities influence global fashion trends is truly fascinating. For instance, how Milan's dedication to quality impacts its reputation worldwide.

>>Fashion Designer: Picture it—Paris Fashion Week—it's like seeing art come to life with every gown showcasing incredible detail and fabric quality. And then there's London with its bold creativity; attending a show there felt like diving into fresh ideas and innovation! 
 >>Sustainability Advocate: Imagine if we could make every fashion week as sustainable as Copenhagen's! Their 2023 standards are a game-changer—recyclable seat cards, fur bans, and designs with at least 50% recycled materials. What if we could change that across all major fashion weeks?

>>Fashion Historian: You know, the idea of making all fashion weeks as sustainable as Copenhagen's reminds me of how historical events have often set precedents for future practices. Paris Fashion Week became such a cultural phenomenon because designers like Paul Poiret combined socializing with showcasing designs, creating an immersive experience that captivated audiences! It's fascinating to see how these early practices can inspire modern sustainable initiatives.

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Let's see... implementing Copenhagen's standards across all major fashion weeks could significantly reduce CO2 emissions. New York Fashion Week alone contributes 37% of total emissions from the Big Four. How does this affect consumer behavior?

>>Fashion Designer: It would be amazing if we could do that! But what steps can we take to start moving in that direction? I mean, design is in the details, right? What if we tried something new and made sustainability the core of our creative process? That would be brilliant!

>>Sustainability Advocate: This could really help cut down our industry's carbon emissions! We need to make eco-friendly practices mainstream. Every step counts in making green the new black!

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: To be honest, the economic implications are profound. Reducing CO2 emissions by 25% could lower transportation costs due to less reliance on traditional fuel sources. How does this affect our long-term economic growth?

>>Fashion Historian: Interestingly enough, sustainability in fashion isn't entirely new! Designers like Charles Frederick Worth laid the groundwork for what we now call fashion weeks by merging social events with design showcases. It's inspiring to see how these early practices can influence today's efforts towards sustainability.

>>Sustainability Advocate: Adopting Copenhagen's standards isn't just environmental—it's cultural too. Imagine if every fashion week became a beacon of sustainability, inspiring designers and consumers alike to embrace eco-friendly practices.

>>Fashion Designer: Yeah! If every designer embraced eco-friendly materials as a standard—not an exception—we'd redefine what fashion means altogether.

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Indeed! The economic ripple effect could be substantial. If consumer demand shifts towards sustainable fashion, brands might need to innovate their supply chains—potentially leading to job creation in green sectors.

>>Fashion Historian: Have you ever wondered why early designers were so influential? They merged social events with design showcases—laying the groundwork for today's sustainable initiatives. 
 >>Fashion Industry Analyst: The 'see now, buy now' trend has really shaken up consumer behavior. We've seen a 15% increase in impulse purchases and a 20% drop in traditional seasonal buying patterns. This shift is pretty significant, don't you think?

>>Sustainability Advocate: It's definitely a mixed bag. On one hand, it satisfies that instant gratification itch; on the other, it can lead to more waste. If we could weave sustainable practices into this model, we'd be making strides towards reducing our carbon footprint.

>>Fashion Historian: It's fascinating how the 'see now, buy now' trend echoes those historical fashion parades where garments were immediately available for purchase. This approach taps into that deep-seated desire for instant gratification that's been around since designers like Charles Frederick Worth made waves back in the late 1800s.

>>Fashion Designer: Designers get immediate feedback from consumers with this trend. But what if we could mix this immediacy with sustainability? Fashion is art and design is all about the details!

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: While boosting sales through immediacy sounds great, it puts pressure on supply chains to adapt quickly. This can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs if not managed well. A 20% reduction in traditional buying patterns shows a shift that might destabilize established retail cycles.

>>Sustainability Advocate: What if every impulse purchase was eco-friendly? The excitement of 'see now, buy now' could be harnessed for sustainable choices too! Green is definitely the new black.

>>Fashion Historian: Historically speaking—um—the 'see now, buy now' trend isn't entirely new. It mirrors those early fashion parades where garments were showcased for immediate purchase.

>>Fashion Designer: Picture it—a canvas where we paint possibilities! What if we infused innovative designs with sustainability? Fashion's art and design are all about capturing attention while being responsible.

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Basically, while reshaping consumer habits sounds promising for sales figures—let's see—it also poses challenges for supply chains needing rapid adaptation. Statistically speaking, these pressures can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs unless managed properly.

>>Sustainability Advocate: You see—if brands committed to sustainable sourcing within these immediate cycles—we'd be taking steps toward a greener future! Every choice counts when aiming for eco-friendliness. 
 >>Fashion Designer: You know, imagine this—what if we could blend the timeless elegance of traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge sustainable materials? Picture it, a collection that honors the past while paving the way for a greener future. It's like creating art that respects history and embraces innovation!

>>Fashion Historian: That's fascinating! You know, back in the day, designers like Paul Poiret revolutionized fashion by combining social events with showcases. Why do you think balancing old and new is so crucial in fashion?

>>Sustainability Advocate: Well, it's not just about blending styles; it's about ensuring every step counts towards a sustainable future. Imagine if we could set strict standards for eco-friendly materials and practices. Green is definitely the new black!

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: I've noticed more consumers are interested in eco-friendly options—did you know there's been a 35% increase in demand over the past year? How does this shift affect consumer expectations?

>>Fashion Designer: I mean, it's all about creating pieces that tell a story—one that respects tradition but also pushes boundaries with innovative designs. What if we could make sustainability an integral part of our creative process?

>>Fashion Historian: You know, designers like Charles Frederick Worth and Coco Chanel were successful because they managed to create timeless pieces by incorporating contemporary elements into their designs! How can we apply their principles to modern sustainability efforts?

>>Sustainability Advocate: Actually, blending traditional craftsmanship with sustainable materials isn't just a trend; it's essential. If we set strict standards for eco-friendly practices, we could truly revolutionize the industry.

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: To be honest, consumers are increasingly valuing eco-friendly products while expecting brands to innovate without losing touch with traditional craftsmanship. This shift indicates a growing demand for responsible fashion choices.

>>Fashion Designer: Like I said earlier, what if we could create collections that not only look stunning but also contribute positively to our planet? It's about finding harmony between creativity and responsibility.

>>Fashion Historian: Interestingly enough, designers like Coco Chanel revolutionized fashion by blending classic elements with modern sensibilities. Have you ever wondered why this approach resonates so deeply within the industry?

>>Sustainability Advocate: The real challenge is ensuring innovation doesn't compromise our planet's health. Setting benchmarks for sustainable practices is crucial—it's time to make green truly fashionable!

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Statistically speaking, there's been significant growth in demand for sustainable options—consumers want brands to preserve tradition while embracing innovation responsibly. 
 >>Fashion Designer: You know, I was just thinking about how fashion can be like a time machine! Last weekend, I found this vintage jacket at a flea market that looked straight out of the '70s. It made me wonder if we're all secretly longing for those disco days again! Have any of you stumbled upon something that took you back in time?

>>Fashion Historian: Oh, absolutely! I once attended a fashion show where the theme was 'Time Travel,' and they had models dressed in outfits from different eras. It was like stepping into a living history book, you know? It's fascinating how certain styles resurface with new meanings. What do you think about how fashion reflects societal changes?

>>Sustainability Advocate: Speaking of how past styles inspire us today, I've been experimenting with eco-friendly dyes using beetroot juice. It was a bit of a mess, but the color turned out surprisingly vibrant! It's amazing how nature can inspire us in unexpected ways. Has anyone tried something eco-friendly that didn't go as planned?

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: Let's see... I once came across an old economics textbook at a garage sale filled with outdated predictions about the fashion industry's growth! It's funny how some forecasts can be so off the mark while others hit the nail on the head. Ever found something that made you rethink past assumptions?

>>Fashion Designer: You know, I recently tried to recreate a childhood memory by baking my grandmother's famous apple pie. It was kind of a disaster, but the smell brought back so many memories! Have any of you ever attempted something nostalgic that didn't quite go as planned?

>>Sustainability Advocate: Actually, I've been there too! Tried making a compost pile in my backyard thinking it would be easy-peasy. Well, let's just say it turned into more of an experiment gone wrong than anything else! But hey, every step counts towards learning how to live more sustainably, right? Anyone else had an eco-friendly project that didn't quite go as planned?

>>Fashion Historian: You know, fashion shows back in the early 20th century were more like theater performances than today's runway events! They had elaborate themes and narratives that captivated audiences. Ever thought about how these dramatic presentations might influence modern fashion storytelling?

>>Fashion Industry Analyst: To be honest—I once tried recreating my grandmother's famous lasagna; it ended up being quite an adventure rather than culinary success! But those smells really do bring back memories... Anyone else have similar experiences trying to relive old times through cooking or crafting?"
