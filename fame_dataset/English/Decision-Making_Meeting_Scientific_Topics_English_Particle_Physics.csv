Particle Physics,"

Particle physics or high-energy physics is the study of fundamental particles and forces that constitute matter and radiation. The field also studies combinations of elementary particles up to the scale of protons and neutrons, while the study of combination of protons and neutrons is called nuclear physics.

The fundamental particles in the universe are classified in the Standard Model as fermions (matter particles) and bosons (force-carrying particles). There are three generations of fermions, although ordinary matter is made only from the first fermion generation. The first generation consists of up and down quarks which form protons and neutrons, and electrons and electron neutrinos. The three fundamental interactions known to be mediated by bosons are electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction.

Quarks cannot exist on their own but form hadrons. Hadrons that contain an odd number of quarks are called baryons and those that contain an even number are called mesons. Two baryons, the proton and the neutron, make up most of the mass of ordinary matter. Mesons are unstable and the longest-lived last for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. They occur after collisions between particles made of quarks, such as fast-moving protons and neutrons in cosmic rays. Mesons are also produced in cyclotrons or other particle accelerators.

Particles have corresponding antiparticles with the same mass but with opposite electric charges. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron. The electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive charge. These antiparticles can theoretically form a corresponding form of matter called antimatter. Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle.

These elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. The reconciliation of gravity to the current particle physics theory is not solved; many theories have addressed this problem, such as loop quantum gravity, string theory and supersymmetry theory.

Practical particle physics is the study of these particles in radioactive processes and in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Theoretical particle physics is the study of these particles in the context of cosmology and quantum theory. The two are closely interrelated: the Higgs boson was postulated by theoretical particle physicists and its presence confirmed by practical experiments.

The idea that all matter is fundamentally composed of elementary particles dates from at least the 6th century BC.[1] In the 19th century, John Dalton, through his work on stoichiometry, concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle.[2] The word atom, after the Greek word atomos meaning ""indivisible"", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a chemical element, but physicists later discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the electron. The early 20th century explorations of nuclear physics and quantum physics led to proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by Lise Meitner (based on experiments by Otto Hahn), and nuclear fusion by Hans Bethe in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of nuclear weapons. Bethe's 1947 calculation of the Lamb shift is credited with having ""opened the way to the modern era of particle physics"".[3]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles was found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy. It was referred to informally as the ""particle zoo"". Important discoveries such as the CP violation by James Cronin and Val Fitch brought new questions to matter-antimatter imbalance.[4] After the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, physicists clarified the origin of the particle zoo. The large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of quantum field theories. This reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics.[5][6]

The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the Standard Model, which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. It describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental interactions, using mediating gauge bosons. The species of gauge bosons are eight gluons, W−, W+ and Z bosons, and the photon.[7] The Standard Model also contains 24 fundamental fermions (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all matter.[8] Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of boson known as the Higgs boson. On 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson.[9]

The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles.[10] Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See Theory of Everything). In recent years, measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos do not have mass in the Standard Model.[11]

Modern particle physics research is focused on subatomic particles, including atomic constituents, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons (protons and neutrons are composite particles called baryons, made of quarks), that are produced by radioactive and scattering processes; such particles are photons, neutrinos, and muons, as well as a wide range of exotic particles.[12] All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by the Standard Model.[7]

Dynamics of particles are also governed by quantum mechanics; they exhibit wave–particle duality, displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and wave-like behaviour in others. In more technical terms, they are described by quantum state vectors in a Hilbert space, which is also treated in quantum field theory. Following the convention of particle physicists, the term elementary particles is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.[10]

Ordinary matter is made from first-generation quarks (up, down) and leptons (electron, electron neutrino).[13] Collectively, quarks and leptons are called fermions, because they have a quantum spin of half-integers (−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, etc.). This causes the fermions to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, where no two particles may occupy the same quantum state.[14] Quarks have fractional elementary electric charge (−1/3 or 2/3)[15] and leptons have whole-numbered electric charge (0 or -1).[16] Quarks also have color charge, which is labeled arbitrarily with no correlation to actual light color as red, green and blue.[17] Because the interactions between the quarks store energy which can convert to other particles when the quarks are far apart enough, quarks cannot be observed independently. This is called color confinement.[17]

There are three known generations of quarks (up and down, strange and charm, top and bottom) and leptons (electron and its neutrino, muon and its neutrino, tau and its neutrino), with strong indirect evidence that a fourth generation of fermions does not exist.[18]

Bosons are the mediators or carriers of fundamental interactions, such as electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction.[19] Electromagnetism is mediated by the photon, the quanta of light.[20]: 29–30  The weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons.[21] The strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, which can link quarks together to form composite particles.[22] Due to the aforementioned color confinement, gluons are never observed independently.[23] The Higgs boson gives mass to the W and Z bosons via the Higgs mechanism[24] – the gluon and photon are expected to be massless.[23] All bosons have an integer quantum spin (0 and 1) and can have the same quantum state.[19]

Most aforementioned particles have corresponding antiparticles, which compose antimatter. Normal particles have positive lepton or baryon number, and antiparticles have these numbers negative.[25] Most properties of corresponding antiparticles and particles are the same, with a few gets reversed; the electron's antiparticle, positron, has an opposite charge. To differentiate between antiparticles and particles, a plus or negative sign is added in superscript. For example, the electron and the positron are denoted e− and e+.[26] However, in the case that the particle has a charge of 0 (equal to that of the antiparticle), the antiparticle is denoted with a line above the symbol. As such, an electron neutrino is νe, whereas its antineutrino is νe. When a particle and an antiparticle interact with each other, they are annihilated and convert to other particles.[27] Some particles, such as the photon or gluon, have no antiparticles.[citation needed]

Quarks and gluons additionally have color charges, which influences the strong interaction. Quark's color charges are called red, green and blue (though the particle itself have no physical color), and in antiquarks are called antired, antigreen and antiblue.[17] The gluon can have eight color charges, which are the result of quarks' interactions to form composite particles (gauge symmetry SU(3)).[28]

The neutrons and protons in the atomic nuclei are baryons – the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark.[29] A baryon is composed of three quarks, and a meson is composed of two quarks (one normal, one anti). Baryons and mesons are collectively called hadrons. Quarks inside hadrons are governed by the strong interaction, thus are subjected to quantum chromodynamics (color charges). The bounded quarks must have their color charge to be neutral, or ""white"" for analogy with mixing the primary colors.[30] More exotic hadrons can have other types, arrangement or number of quarks (tetraquark, pentaquark).[31]

An atom is made from protons, neutrons and electrons.[32] By modifying the particles inside a normal atom, exotic atoms can be formed.[33] A simple example would be the hydrogen-4.1, which has one of its electrons replaced with a muon.[34]

The graviton is a hypothetical particle that can mediate the gravitational interaction, but it has not been detected or completely reconciled with current theories.[35] Many other hypothetical particles have been proposed to address the limitations of the Standard Model. Notably, supersymmetric particles aim to solve the hierarchy problem, axions address the strong CP problem, and various other particles are proposed to explain the origins of dark matter and dark energy.

The world's major particle physics laboratories are:



Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also theoretical physics). There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today.

One important branch attempts to better understand the Standard Model and its tests. Theorists make quantitative predictions of observables at collider and astronomical experiments, which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the Standard Model with less uncertainty. This work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature's building blocks. Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating high precision quantities in quantum chromodynamics. Some theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative quantum field theory and effective field theory, referring to themselves as phenomenologists.[citation needed] Others make use of lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theorists.

Another major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the Standard Model (at higher energies or smaller distances). This work is often motivated by the hierarchy problem and is constrained by existing experimental data.[48][49] It may involve work on supersymmetry, alternatives to the Higgs mechanism, extra spatial dimensions (such as the Randall–Sundrum models), Preon theory, combinations of these, or other ideas. Vanishing-dimensions theory is a particle physics theory suggesting that systems with higher energy have a smaller number of dimensions.[50]

A third major effort in theoretical particle physics is string theory. String theorists attempt to construct a unified description of quantum mechanics and general relativity by building a theory based on small strings, and branes rather than particles. If the theory is successful, it may be considered a ""Theory of Everything"", or ""TOE"".[51]

There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology to loop quantum gravity.[citation needed]

In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles. In practice, even if ""particle physics"" is taken to mean only ""high-energy atom smashers"", many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society. Particle accelerators are used to produce medical isotopes for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in PET imaging), or used directly in external beam radiotherapy. The development of superconductors has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics. The World Wide Web and touchscreen technology were initially developed at CERN. Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics.[52]

Major efforts to look for physics beyond the Standard Model include the Future Circular Collider proposed for CERN[53] and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) in the US that will update the 2014 P5 study that recommended the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, among other experiments.

The Standard Model was highlighted as the primary framework classifying these particles into fermions (matter particles) and bosons (force-carrying particles). It was noted that ordinary matter is composed of first-generation fermions, including up and down quarks, electrons, and electron neutrinos. The interactions mediated by bosons include electromagnetism, weak interaction, and strong interaction.

Discussions covered the nature of quarks forming hadrons such as baryons (protons and neutrons) and mesons, with emphasis on their instability and production in particle accelerators. Antiparticles were also addressed, noting their opposite charges compared to their corresponding particles. The concept of antimatter was briefly explored.

The Standard Model's success in explaining most experimental observations was acknowledged, though it remains incomplete due to unresolved issues like gravity integration. Various theories such as loop quantum gravity, string theory, and supersymmetry were mentioned as potential solutions.

Practical applications of particle physics in medical isotopes production, radiotherapy, superconductors development, and technological innovations like the World Wide Web were recognized.

Glad you're here. Let's dive into some interesting topics today. How about we start with a quick round of introductions? You go first.

>>Particle Physicist: Hi everyone, looking forward to our discussion.

>>Historian of Science: Hi all, excited to be here. The evolution of particle physics has been nothing short of remarkable. Remember when J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897? It revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure and paved the way for modern particle physics.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Yeah, discovering the electron was huge. It really helped us understand how particles interact and build our models of the universe.

>>Educator: It's great to have such a diverse group here today. Let's break down these complex topics so everyone leaves with a clearer understanding. Make sure we all get a chance to share our thoughts and questions.

>>Science Communicator: Before we move on, does anyone have specific questions or points they want us to focus on?

>>Particle Physicist: I'd love it if we could delve deeper into recent discoveries shaping current theories.

>>Historian of Science: Great point! We should also look at how these theories compare with historical perspectives.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Absolutely, both angles would be fascinating.

>>Educator: Great suggestions! This will help us keep our discussion well-rounded and engaging for everyone. 
 >>Particle Physicist: Well, particle physics delves into the fundamental particles and forces that make up our universe. The Standard Model is our best guess at how these particles work together, categorizing them into fermions and bosons. First-generation fermions, like up and down quarks, form protons and neutrons, while electrons and electron neutrinos are essential for ordinary matter.

>>Science Communicator: So, as you mentioned, first-generation fermions like up and down quarks form protons and neutrons. What's really fascinating is how these particles interact through forces mediated by bosons. It's like a giant puzzle where fermions are the pieces of matter, and bosons are the forces holding them together.

>>Historian of Science: Historically speaking, the development of particle physics has been a journey of remarkable discoveries. From J.J. Thomson's identification of the electron to the formulation of the Standard Model in the 1970s, each milestone has significantly shaped our understanding of matter and forces. When quarks were first proposed, it revolutionized how we perceive subatomic particles!

>>Theoretical Physicist: The Standard Model is indeed a robust framework but has its limitations. For instance, it doesn't incorporate gravity—one of the biggest challenges in theoretical physics.

>>Educator: Right! And it's important to keep things accessible for everyone here so we can all stay engaged with these fascinating topics.

>>Science Communicator: Exactly! Think about it this way: the Standard Model is like a recipe book for the universe. It tells us how to combine different ingredients—or particles—to create everything we see around us. But just like any recipe book, it's not complete; sometimes we need to improvise!

>>Particle Physicist: Yes! And while comprehensive, it doesn't account for gravity. This gap remains one of our most exciting challenges in particle physics.

>>Historian of Science: Indeed! The historical context is filled with pivotal moments like the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012—a monumental achievement confirming a key prediction of the Standard Model. This discovery validated decades of theoretical work and opened new avenues for exploring physics beyond it.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Absolutely! That's a great point about gravity. How do you think we might start to tackle that challenge?

>>Particle Physicist: One approach could be looking into theories that go beyond the Standard Model, such as string theory or loop quantum gravity.

>>Educator: Those are definitely exciting areas to explore! And making sure everyone can follow along will help us all stay engaged with these fascinating topics. 
 >>Particle Physicist: Well, considering the quarks and hadrons, it's crucial to understand that quarks are never found in isolation due to color confinement. They always form composite particles like baryons and mesons. The crux of the matter is, these interactions are governed by quantum chromodynamics, which explains how quarks bind together through gluon exchange.

>>Science Communicator: So, think about it this way: quarks are like the building blocks of matter, but they can't just hang out on their own. They need to team up to form hadrons, which are like the bricks and mortar of everything around us. And these teams are held together by gluons, kind of like a cosmic glue! It's fascinating how particle accelerators help us see these interactions in action.

>>Historian of Science: Let me take you back in time: the concept of quarks and hadrons has a fascinating history. The discovery of quarks in the 1960s by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig revolutionized our understanding of particle physics. Before this, we were dealing with what was known as the 'particle zoo,' a bewildering array of particles that seemed unrelated. The introduction of quarks provided a unifying framework that simplified this complexity remarkably!

>>Theoretical Physicist: To put it simply, quantum chromodynamics describes how quarks combine to form hadrons through gluon exchange. It's like they follow specific rules to stay together.

>>Science Communicator: Right! And particle accelerators let us observe these processes directly.

>>Particle Physicist: Indeed! The production of mesons in particle accelerators is particularly fascinating. These unstable particles only last for a few hundredths of a microsecond but provide invaluable insights into the strong interaction and the behavior of quarks under extreme conditions.

>>Educator: So true! It's amazing how these fleeting moments can tell us so much about fundamental forces at play.

>>Historian of Science: Historically speaking, particle accelerators have been instrumental in validating theoretical predictions and uncovering new particles—much like how the Large Hadron Collider confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Exactly! When mesons decay almost instantaneously after being produced in particle accelerators, we're able to study fundamental forces at play in real-time.

>>Science Communicator: It's incredible how these particle accelerators allow us to peek into the very fabric of our universe. Every time we observe these particles, we're not just seeing them; we're understanding fundamental rules governing their behavior.

>>Particle Physicist: Yes! Observing mesons gives us unique glimpses into strong interactions at their most intense moments.

>>Educator: And it's not just about observing; it's about piecing together clues from each observation—like solving a cosmic mystery! 
 >>Particle Physicist: Well, considering antiparticles, it's fascinating how they mirror their particle counterparts with opposite charges. For instance, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron, possessing a positive charge instead of a negative one. This symmetry is crucial in understanding antimatter.

>>Science Communicator: Imagine this: if we could harness antimatter, it would be like having a supercharged battery! But producing and storing antimatter is incredibly challenging. Just a gram of antimatter could potentially power an entire city for a day. It's mind-blowing!

>>Historian of Science: Historically speaking, the concept of antimatter has always been intriguing. When Paul Dirac first predicted the existence of antiparticles in 1928, it was groundbreaking and expanded our understanding of the universe. The subsequent discovery of the positron by Carl Anderson in 1932 confirmed Dirac's theory and opened new avenues for research.

>>Theoretical Physicist: And when particles and antiparticles meet, they annihilate each other, releasing immense energy. This isn't just theoretical; it has practical implications in fields like medical imaging and potential future energy sources.

>>Educator: Think about PET scans used in hospitals to diagnose diseases—that's one real-world application where this concept is already making a difference.

>>Particle Physicist: Indeed! When an electron meets a positron—

>>Science Communicator (interrupting): Wait, so when you say ""annihilate,"" do you mean they completely disappear?

>>Particle Physicist: Yes exactly! They convert into gamma-ray photons. This process releases immense energy and provides insights into fundamental symmetries of nature.

>>Science Communicator: That's incredible! If we could harness that energy—

>>Historian of Science (acknowledging): —it would be revolutionary for our energy systems. While it's exciting to think about future applications, it's also important to remember how we got here... 
 >>Particle Physicist: Well, the Standard Model has indeed been remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of experimental observations. However, it falls short when it comes to integrating gravity. We have a robust framework for electromagnetism, weak and strong interactions, but gravity remains elusive within this model.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Right, and that's a big deal because it means our current understanding might be incomplete. We need to think outside the box to find a way to unify these forces.

>>Science Communicator: So, imagine the Standard Model as a beautifully crafted puzzle that fits together almost perfectly. But there's this one piece—gravity—that just doesn't seem to fit anywhere. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. This gap really highlights how much more we have to learn and discover.

>>Historian of Science: Historically speaking, the quest to integrate gravity into our understanding of fundamental forces has been a long-standing challenge. When Einstein introduced his theory of general relativity, it revolutionized our understanding of gravity. Yet even then—

>>Educator (interrupting): Sorry to jump in here! Can someone clarify how string theory attempts to address this issue? I think some context on alternative theories would be helpful.

>>Particle Physicist: Sure! String theory proposes that instead of point particles, fundamental entities are one-dimensional ""strings."" These strings can vibrate at different frequencies which correspond to different particles. This framework naturally includes gravity by incorporating gravitons—hypothetical particles that mediate gravitational force.

>>Theoretical Physicist: Exactly! And what's fascinating is that string theory offers a potential way to unify all fundamental forces under one theoretical umbrella.
